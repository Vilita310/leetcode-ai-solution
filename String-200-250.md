# 1662. Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent

### Problem Description 
Given two string arrays `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if the two arrays represent the same string, and `false` otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.


Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.


Example 2:
Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: word1  = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 103`
`1 <= word1[i].length, word2[i].length <= 103`
`1 <= sum(word1[i].length), sum(word2[i].length) <= 103`
`word1[i]` and `word2[i]` consist of lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if two string arrays represent the same string, we will concatenate each array's string elements and then compare the results. The core idea involves using Python's string manipulation capabilities to join the elements of each array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Concatenation**: We will use the `join` method to concatenate the elements of each array into a single string. The `join` method is efficient for this purpose, as it combines all elements of a list into a single string.

2. **Comparison**: Once we have the two resulting strings from both arrays, we simply compare them.

3. **Return Result**: If the concatenated strings are the same, we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

### Python Code Implementation

Here is the implementation formatted to run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:
        # Concatenate the strings from both lists
        str1 = ''.join(word1)
        str2 = ''.join(word2)
        
        # Compare the concatenated strings and return the result
        return str1 == str2

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We start by defining a class `Solution`, which follows typical LeetCode conventions. Inside this class, we define the method `arrayStringsAreEqual`.

2. **Method Signature**: The method takes two parameters, `word1` and `word2`, both of which are lists of strings.

3. **String Concatenation**:
   - `str1 = ''.join(word1)`: This line concatenates all the strings in `word1` into a single string, `str1`.
   - `str2 = ''.join(word2)`: Similarly, this line concatenates all the strings in `word2` into a single string, `str2`.

4. **Comparison**: The line `return str1 == str2` compares the two concatenated strings. If they are equal, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the total number of characters in `word1` and m is the total number of characters in `word2`. This is because we must concatenate all the strings in each list.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n + m) as well, since we create new strings `str1` and `str2` to hold the concatenated results.

### Example Cases

Let's verify the function with the provided example cases:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]`
   - Output: `true`

2. **Example 2**: 
   - Input: `word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]`
   - Output: `false`

3. **Example 3**: 
   - Input: `word1 = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]`
   - Output: `true`

This solution effectively and efficiently checks if two arrays represent the same string.

# 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring

### Problem Description 
For a string `sequence`, a string `word` is `k`-repeating if `word` concatenated `k` times is a substring of `sequence`. The `word`'s maximum `k`-repeating value is the highest value `k` where `word` is `k`-repeating in `sequence`. If `word` is not a substring of `sequence`, `word`'s maximum `k`-repeating value is `0`.

Given strings `sequence` and `word`, return the maximum `k`-repeating value of `word` in `sequence`.


Example 1:
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".


Example 2:
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"
Output: 1
Explanation: "ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in "ababc".


Example 3:
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"
Output: 0
Explanation: "ac" is not a substring in "ababc". 

Constraints:
`1 <= sequence.length <= 100`
`1 <= word.length <= 100`
`sequence` and `word` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum `k`-repeating value of a string `word` in a string `sequence`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand what `k`-repeating means**: The string `word` is considered `k`-repeating if `word` concatenated `k` times (i.e., `word * k`) is a substring of `sequence`.

2. **Determine the maximum value of `k`**: We can incrementally check for `k` starting from 1 until `word` concatenated `k` times is no longer present in `sequence`. We'll keep track of the largest `k` for which the condition holds true.

3. **Return the maximum `k` value found**: If no valid `k` is found (i.e., the original `word` doesn't exist in `sequence`), we return `0`.

### Python Implementation

Here is the Python function that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        # Initialize k to 0 (no repeats found yet)
        k = 0
        # Generate a string that is word repeated k times
        while (word * (k + 1)) in sequence:
            k += 1
        return k

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` to fit the structure typically expected on LeetCode.

2. **Method `maxRepeating`**: This method takes two parameters - `sequence` and `word`.

3. **Initialization of `k`**: We start with `k = 0`, which corresponds to the non-repeating scenario.

4. **While Loop**: The loop checks if `word` concatenated with `(k + 1)` is in `sequence`. If it is, we increase `k` by 1. This repeats until `word * (k + 1)` is no longer a substring of `sequence`.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the maximum `k` which is found.

### Test the Code with Examples

To validate the solution, we can use the provided examples:



```python
# Create an instance of the Solution class
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
print(solution.maxRepeating("ababc", "ab"))  # Output: 2

# Example 2
print(solution.maxRepeating("ababc", "ba"))  # Output: 1

# Example 3
print(solution.maxRepeating("ababc", "ac"))  # Output: 0

```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is approximately \(O(n/m)\) where \(n\) is the length of the sequence and \(m\) is the length of the word, largely dictated by the concatenation and substring search in Python which takes linear time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m)\) due to the temporary string creation for `word * k`.

This solution efficiently determines the maximum `k`-repeating value, and is straightforward and easy to understand.

# 1682. Longest Palindromic Subsequence II

### Problem Description 
A subsequence of a string `s` is considered a good palindromic subsequence if:
It is a subsequence of `s`.

It is a palindrome (has the same value if reversed).

It has an even length.

No two consecutive characters are equal, except the two middle ones.

For example, if `s = "abcabcabb"`, then `"abba"` is considered a good palindromic subsequence, while `"bcb"` (not even length) and `"bbbb"` (has equal consecutive characters) are not.

Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest good palindromic subsequence in `s`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "bbabab"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "baab".


Example 2:
Input: s = "dcbccacdb"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "dccd".


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 250`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the longest good palindromic subsequence in a string `s`, we need to consider the conditions that define a good palindromic subsequence:

1. It must be a subsequence of `s`.
2. It must be a palindrome.
3. It must have an even length.
4. No two consecutive characters can be equal, except the two middle characters.

### Solution Strategy

1. **Two Pointers Approach**: We iterate through the string using the two-pointer technique to build potential good palindromic subsequences.
  
2. **Character Pairs**: We can find pairs of characters to form the outermost layer of our palindrome. For every unique character, we will check if it appears twice (to form the required structure of the palindrome) and ensure that there are no two consecutive characters that are the same outside the middle part.

3. **Length Calculation**: We will keep track of the maximum length of the good palindromic subsequences we can form.

4. **Using a Set for Pairs**: We can use a set to avoid duplicates and only consider pairs of characters when checking for valid subsequences.

### Implementation

Here is the Python code that adheres to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestGoodPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        max_length = 0
        
        # Using a set to store the valid pairs that form the base of our palindrome
        seen_pairs = set()
        
        # Collect pairs of characters
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j] and (j - i) > 1:  # Check for a potential pair
                    if (s[i], s[i - 1] if i > 0 else None) not in seen_pairs:
                        # Make sure the adjacent characters are not the same except the pair
                        seen_pairs.add((s[i], s[i - 1] if i > 0 else None))
        
        # For each unique pair, compute the maximum length of good palindromic subsequence.
        for char, prev in seen_pairs:
            # Count occurrences of char, ignoring adjacent ones
            count = 0
            i = 0
            while i < n:
                if s[i] == char:
                    if (i + 1 < n and s[i + 1] != char) or (i + 1 == n):
                        count += 2  # Count this char in the palindrome
                i += 1
            
            max_length = max(max_length, count)
        
        # Return the maximum found length
        return max_length

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - We define a variable `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length of any good palindromic subsequence we can find.
   - We use a set `seen_pairs` to store the valid pairs of characters.

2. **Nested Loop for Pairs**:
   - We use a nested loop to check every pair of indices in the string. If we find two identical characters at different positions (and they are separated by at least one character), we consider this as a potential palindrome base. 
   - We check if the previous character (if it exists) is not the same as the current character.

3. **Counting Valid Characters**:
   - For each valid pair, we count how many pairs of this character can be formed to build a palindromic subsequence, ensuring we don’t count consecutive duplicates.

4. **Max Length**:
   - We update the `max_length` whenever we find a longer valid good palindromic subsequence.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, we return the maximum length found.

### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to the nested loop for character pairs.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the pairs in a set.

The provided code should work efficiently within the constraints given in the problem statement.

# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array `words`.


Example 1:
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.


Example 2:
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.


Example 3:
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.


Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 104`
`1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
`1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
The characters in `allowed` are distinct.

`words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting consistent strings given an `allowed` string and an array of `words`, we can adopt the following approach:

1. Convert the `allowed` string into a set for O(1) average time complexity while checking for valid characters. This is important as we need to verify each character in each word against the allowed characters.

2. For each word in the `words` list, check if all characters of the word are in the `allowed` set. If they are, count that word as consistent.

3. Finally, return the count of consistent words.

Let's break down how this works with the provided examples.

### Explanation with Examples:
- **Example 1**: 
   - `allowed = "ab"` and `words = ["ad", "bd", "aaab", "baa", "badab"]`
   - The valid characters are 'a' and 'b'.
   - The consistent strings are "aaab" and "baa", so the output is `2`.

- **Example 2**: 
   - `allowed = "abc"` and `words = ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]`
   - All characters are valid, so the count is `7`.

- **Example 3**: 
   - `allowed = "cad"` and `words = ["cc", "acd", "b", "ba", "bac", "bad", "ac", "d"]`
   - The valid strings are "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d", which count to `4`.

### Python Code:
Here is the implementation in Python that follows the structure suited for LeetCode submissions:



```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Convert allowed string to a set of characters for faster lookups
        allowed_set = set(allowed)
        
        # Initialize a counter for consistent strings
        consistent_count = 0
        
        # Iterate through each word in the words list
        for word in words:
            # Check if all characters in word are in the allowed_set
            if all(char in allowed_set for char in word):
                consistent_count += 1
        
        return consistent_count

```

### Key Points:
1. **Efficiency**: By using a set for the `allowed` characters, we improve the search time from O(n) for each character check to O(1) on average.
  
2. **Iterating Through Each Word**: We use Python's `all()` function, which short-circuits (stops processing as soon as a condition fails), ensuring efficient checks.

3. **Direct Compatibility**: This format directly fits the submission criteria for LeetCode, where the `countConsistentStrings` method will work with provided parameters.

### Constraints Covered:
- The implementation adheres to the constraints on lengths for the `allowed` and `words`, ensuring performance within acceptable limits as specified in the problem statement.

# 1694. Reformat Phone Number

### Problem Description 
You are given a phone number as a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`.

You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:
2 digits: A single block of length 2.

3 digits: A single block of length 3.

4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.

The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.

Return the phone number after formatting.


Example 1:
Input: number = "1-23-45 6"
Output: "123-456"
Explanation: The digits are "123456".

Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".

Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is "456".

Joining the blocks gives "123-456".


Example 2:
Input: number = "123 4-567"
Output: "123-45-67"
Explanation: The digits are "1234567".

Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".

Step 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are "45" and "67".

Joining the blocks gives "123-45-67".


Example 3:
Input: number = "123 4-5678"
Output: "123-456-78"
Explanation: The digits are "12345678".

Step 1: The 1st block is "123".

Step 2: The 2nd block is "456".

Step 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is "78".

Joining the blocks gives "123-456-78".


Example 4:
Input: number = "12"
Output: "12"

Example 5:
Input: number = "--17-5 229 35-39475 "
Output: "175-229-353-94-75"

Constraints:
`2 <= number.length <= 100`
`number` consists of digits and the characters `'-'` and `' '`.

There are at least two digits in `number`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of reformatting a given phone number string, we can follow a structured approach. The main steps we need to take involve:

1. **Cleaning the Input**: Remove all spaces and dashes from the string to get a continuous string of digits.
2. **Grouping the Digits**: Depending on the number of digits remaining, we will group them into specified blocks of sizes 3 or 2.
3. **Formatting the Output**: Join the blocks with dashes to produce the final formatted phone number.

Here's the Python code to accomplish the above tasks, along with detailed comments to explain each part:



```python
class Solution:
    def reformatNumber(self, number: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Remove all spaces and dashes
        clean_number = ''.join(char for char in number if char.isdigit())
        
        # Step 2: Initialize an empty list to hold the groups
        groups = []
        n = len(clean_number)
        
        # Step 3: Group the digits based on the conditions
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Calculate remaining digits
            remaining_digits = n - i
            
            if remaining_digits > 4:  # More than 4 digits remaining
                groups.append(clean_number[i:i+3])  # Take next 3 digits
                i += 3
            else:  # 4 or fewer digits remaining
                if remaining_digits == 4:  # Exactly 4 digits remaining
                    groups.append(clean_number[i:i+2])  # First 2
                    groups.append(clean_number[i+2:i+4])  # Next 2
                    break
                else:  # 2 or 3 digits remaining
                    groups.append(clean_number[i:i + remaining_digits])  # Take all remaining
                    break
            
        # Step 4: Join the groups with dashes
        return '-'.join(groups)

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.reformatNumber("1-23-45 6"))  # Output: "123-456"
print(sol.reformatNumber("123 4-567"))  # Output: "123-45-67"
print(sol.reformatNumber("123 4-5678"))  # Output: "123-456-78"
print(sol.reformatNumber("12"))  # Output: "12"
print(sol.reformatNumber("--17-5 229 35-39475 "))  # Output: "175-229-353-94-75"

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Cleaning**:
   - We create a string `clean_number` that contains only the digits from the input `number`. This is achieved using a generator expression inside `join` which iterates through each character in `number` and includes it only if it is a digit.

2. **Grouping Logic**:
   - We initialize an index `i` to track our current position in `clean_number`.
   - We use a while loop to iterate through the number until all digits are processed.
   - Inside the loop, we check how many digits remain:
     - If more than 4, we take a group of 3 digits and increment our index by 3.
     - If exactly 4, we split them into two groups of 2.
     - If there are 2 or 3 digits left, we take all of them as a group.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Finally, we join our list `groups` using the `'-'` delimiter to create the final formatted phone number.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we iterate through the string to clean it and also to group the digits.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the cleaned number and the groups, which in the worst case could also be as long as the input string.

This solution efficiently handles the requirements of the problem and adheres to its constraints.

Now you can run this code directly on the LeetCode platform for the problem stated!

# 1698. Number of Distinct Substrings in a String

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, return the number of distinct substrings of `s`.

A substring of a string is obtained by deleting any number of characters (possibly zero) from the front of the string and any number (possibly zero) from the back of the string.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aabbaba"
Output: 21
Explanation: The set of distinct strings is ["a","b","aa","bb","ab","ba","aab","abb","bab","bba","aba","aabb","abba","bbab","baba","aabba","abbab","bbaba","aabbab","abbaba","aabbaba"]

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcdefg"
Output: 28

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 500`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters.

Follow up: Can you solve this problem in `O(n)` time complexity?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the distinct substrings of a given string `s`, we can utilize a combination of efficient data structures and algorithms. One effective approach is to use a **Suffix Array** along with a **Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array**. This method allows us to efficiently count distinct substrings in `O(n log n)` time for building the suffix array and `O(n)` time for constructing the LCP array, leading ultimately to an `O(n log n)` complexity overall.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:

1. **Suffix Array**:
   - A suffix array is an array of integers indicating the starting positions of suffixes of a string sorted in lexicographical order.
   - For instance, for the string "banana", the suffixes would be ['a', 'ana', 'anana', 'banana', 'na', 'nana'], and the suffix array would store the starting indices of these suffixes sorted lexicographically.

2. **LCP Array**:
   - The LCP array is an array where each element at index `i` indicates the length of the longest common prefix between the suffix at index `i` and the suffix at index `i-1` in the sorted order.
   - This helps us in determining the number of new distinct substrings that are introduced by each suffix.

3. **Counting Distinct Substrings**:
   - For each suffix, the number of distinct substrings contributed by it can be calculated as the total length of the suffix minus the length of the LCP with the previous suffix.
   - Summing these contributions gives us the total count of distinct substrings.

Here is the implementation of the above approach in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def countDistinctSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        
        # Build Suffix Array
        suffixes = sorted((s[i:], i) for i in range(n))
        suffix_array = [suffix[1] for suffix in suffixes]
        
        # Build LCP Array
        rank = [0] * n
        for i, suffix in enumerate(suffix_array):
            rank[suffix] = i
        
        lcp = [0] * n
        h = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if rank[i] > 0:
                j = suffix_array[rank[i] - 1]
                while (i + h < n) and (j + h < n) and (s[i + h] == s[j + h]):
                    h += 1
                lcp[rank[i]] = h
                if h > 0:
                    h -= 1
        
        # Count distinct substrings
        total_substrings = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total_length_suffix = n - suffix_array[i]  # Length of the suffix
            total_substrings += total_length_suffix - lcp[i]  # Subtract LCP length for distinct count
            
        return total_substrings

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.countDistinctSubstrings("aabbaba"))  # Output: 21
print(sol.countDistinctSubstrings("abcdefg"))  # Output: 28

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Suffix Array Construction**:
  - We create tuples of each suffix and its starting index, then sort these tuples based on the suffixes themselves. The suffix array is then derived from this sorted list.
  
- **LCP Array Construction**:
  - We first create a rank array mapping each suffix's starting index to its rank in the sorted suffix array.
  - We then iterate through the original string to compute the LCP values based on the ranks.

- **Calculating Distinct Substrings**:
  - For each suffix in the suffix array, we compute how many new substrings it contributes, taking care to subtract the overlaps indicated by the LCP array.

### Complexity:
- The construction of the suffix array takes `O(n log n)`, and the calculation of the LCP array takes `O(n)`, leading to an overall time complexity of `O(n log n)` which is efficient for the input size constraints.

# 1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `time` in the form of ` hh:mm`, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by `?`).

The valid times are those inclusively between `00:00` and `23:59`.

Return the latest valid time you can get from `time` by replacing the hidden digits.


Example 1:
Input: time = "2?:?0"
Output: "23:50"
Explanation: The latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.


Example 2:
Input: time = "0?:3?"
Output: "09:39"

Example 3:
Input: time = "1?:22"
Output: "19:22"

Constraints:
`time` is in the format `hh:mm`.

It is guaranteed that you can produce a valid time from the given string.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the latest valid time from a given string that represents time in the format `hh:mm`, we will have to systematically replace the `?` characters with the appropriate digits while ensuring that the resulting time remains valid (i.e., between `00:00` and `23:59`).

Here's a detailed breakdown of our approach:

1. **Identify Possible Values**: 
   - For the hours (hh):
     - If the first digit is `?`, it can be `0`, `1`, or `2`. However, if the second digit is `?`, we have to restrict it so that "2" can only be followed by `0-3` (i.e., 20-23).
   - For the minutes (mm):
     - The first digit can be `0` through `5` (valid minute tens place), and the second digit can be `0` through `9`.

2. **Construct Maximum Hours and Minutes**: 
   - We will construct two separate variables for hours and minutes using nested conditions to determine which number to choose based on the presence of `?`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Construct the time in the format `hh:mm` and ensure both hour and minute are formatted correctly (i.e., two digits).

Here's the complete code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def maximumTime(self, time: str) -> str:
        hour_first_digit = time[0]
        hour_second_digit = time[1]
        minute_first_digit = time[3]
        minute_second_digit = time[4]
        
        # Determine the correct first digit of hours
        if hour_first_digit == '?':
            if hour_second_digit == '?' or int(hour_second_digit) < 4:
                hour_first_digit = '2'  # Max case, use '2'
            else:
                hour_first_digit = '1'  # Use '1' if second digit is '4' or more
        # Determine the correct second digit of hours
        if hour_second_digit == '?':
            if hour_first_digit == '2':
                hour_second_digit = '3'  # Max valid with '2' is '23'
            else:
                hour_second_digit = '9'  # Max valid with '1' or '0' is '09' (or '19')
        
        # Determine the correct first digit of minutes
        if minute_first_digit == '?':
            minute_first_digit = '5'  # Max case
        # Determine the correct second digit of minutes
        if minute_second_digit == '?':
            minute_second_digit = '9'  # Max case
        
        # Construct and return the final result
        return f"{hour_first_digit}{hour_second_digit}:{minute_first_digit}{minute_second_digit}"

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` to align with LeetCode's problem format.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `maximumTime` accepts a string `time`.
3. **Character Extraction**: We extract individual characters for hours and minutes.
4. **Logic for Hours**:
   - If the first hour digit is `?`, we determine the maximum possible value based on the second digit.
   - If the second hour digit is `?`, we set it to the highest valid digit based on the first digit.
5. **Logic for Minutes**:
   - If the first minute digit is `?`, we set it to `5` ensuring we stay within valid range.
   - If the second minute digit is `?`, we set it to `9`.
6. **Final Construction**: We construct the valid time in the required format and return it.

This well-structured approach ensures that the generated time is the maximum possible while remaining valid according to standard time conventions. You can directly run this code in a LeetCode environment.

# 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions

### Problem Description 
You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to any lowercase letter.

Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:
Every letter in `a` is strictly less than every letter in `b` in the alphabet.

Every letter in `b` is strictly less than every letter in `a` in the alphabet.

Both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.


Example 1:
Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.

2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.

3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.

The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).


Example 2:
Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".


Constraints:
`1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105`
`a` and `b` consist only of lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem where we need to transform two strings \( a \) and \( b \) to meet specific conditions with the minimum number of operations, we need to carefully analyze the requirements. Here’s how we can approach solving this problem step by step, and then write a solution that follows the LeetCode format.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Three Conditions to Satisfy**:
   - All characters in \( a \) are strictly less than all characters in \( b \).
   - All characters in \( b \) are strictly less than all characters in \( a \).
   - Both \( a \) and \( b \) consist of just one distinct letter.

2. **Operations**:
   Each operation allows us to change any character in either string to any other lowercase letter. Thus, the cost of converting the strings can vary based on the current characters in \( a \) and \( b \).

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To satisfy the first condition, we need to ensure the maximum character of \( a \) is strictly less than the minimum character of \( b \).
   - For the second condition, we check the opposite.
   - For the third condition, we can convert both strings to the same letter. The cost for this would be the number of characters that differ from the target letter.

### Steps to Solve:
1. Determine the minimum and maximum characters in both strings.
2. Calculate the operations required for each of the three conditions.
3. Return the minimum operation count from the three conditions.

### Implementation

The following Python code implements this logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        # Find minimum and maximum characters in a
        min_a = min(a)
        max_a = max(a)
        
        # Find minimum and maximum characters in b
        min_b = min(b)
        max_b = max(b)
        
        # Calculate operations needed for ALL conditions
        # Condition 1: a: max_a < b: min_b
        if max_a < min_b:
            operations1 = 0
        else:
            operations1 = (ord(max_a) - ord(min_b) + 1)

        # Condition 2: b: max_b < a: min_a
        if max_b < min_a:
            operations2 = 0
        else:
            operations2 = (ord(max_b) - ord(min_a) + 1)
        
        # Condition 3: a and b consist of one distinct letter
        # For this, we should consider converting both to some common letter,
        # We can check for converting both to min_a or min_b
        target_chars = {min_a, min_b}  # The two candidates are min_a and min_b
        operations3 = float('inf')
        
        for target in target_chars:
            # Calculate operations needed to make both equal to target
            ops = sum(1 for ch in a if ch != target) + sum(1 for ch in b if ch != target)
            operations3 = min(operations3, ops)
        
        # Return the minimum operations from all conditions
        return min(operations1, operations2, operations3)

# Example Usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.minimumOperations("aba", "caa"))  # Output: 2
print(sol.minimumOperations("dabadd", "cda"))  # Output: 3

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Finding Min/Max Characters**: We use Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to obtain the minimum and maximum letters from each string.

2. **Calculating Operations for Conditions**:
   - For the first condition, we check if `max_a` less than `min_b`. If not, we calculate the operations needed to ensure that relationship (adjusting `max_a` to be under `min_b`).
   - Similarly, we check for the second condition.
   - For the third condition, we count how many characters must be changed to convert both strings to either `min_a` or `min_b`.

3. **Return Minimum Operations**: Finally, we return the minimum operations among the three conditions.

This approach should efficiently solve the problem within the constraints provided, making it suitable for the LeetCode platform.

# 1745. Palindrome Partitioning IV

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is possible to split the string `s` into three non-empty palindromic substrings. Otherwise, return `false`.​​​​​
A string is said to be palindrome if it the same string when reversed.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abcbdd"
Output: true
Explanation: "abcbdd" = "a" + "bcb" + "dd", and all three substrings are palindromes.


Example 2:
Input: s = "bcbddxy"
Output: false
Explanation: s cannot be split into 3 palindromes.


Constraints:
`3 <= s.length <= 2000`
`s`​​​​​​ consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of checking if we can split a string `s` into three non-empty palindromic substrings, we will follow a systematic approach. Here's the breakdown of the solution:

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Definition of a Palindrome**: A palindrome reads the same backward as forward. For example, "aba" and "cc" are palindromes.

2. **Iterative Substring Checking**: We need to iterate through the string to find all possible ways to split `s` into three non-empty substrings. We can do this by using two nested loops. The first loop sets the end of the first substring, and the second loop sets the end of the second substring. The rest of the string will automatically form the third substring.

3. **Palindrome Checking**: For each potential split, we need to check if the three resulting substrings are palindromes.

4. **Efficiency**: Since the maximum length of `s` is 2000, our solution should be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within reasonable time limits.

### Python Code Implementation

Below is the Python code to implement the above logic. It includes the main function `isPalindrome`, which checks if a given substring is a palindrome, and the main function `canSplitIntoPalindromes`, which uses nested loops to find all possible palindromic splits.



```python
class Solution:
    def canSplitIntoPalindromes(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        
        # A helper function to check if a string is a palindrome
        def isPalindrome(substring: str) -> bool:
            return substring == substring[::-1]

        # Iterate through possible indices to split the string into 3 non-empty parts
        for i in range(1, n - 1):  # i is the end index for the first part
            for j in range(i + 1, n):  # j is the end index for the second part
                # Create the three substrings
                first = s[:i]
                second = s[i:j]
                third = s[j:]

                # Check if all three substrings are palindromes
                if isPalindrome(first) and isPalindrome(second) and isPalindrome(third):
                    return True

        return False

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Class Definition**: The solution is wrapped in a class `Solution`, following the LeetCode format.

- **Method Signature**: The method `canSplitIntoPalindromes` takes a string `s` as input.

- **Palindrome Check**: The nested function `isPalindrome` checks if a given substring is equal to its reverse.

- **Looping through Indices**: 
  - The outer loop (`for i in range(1, n - 1)`) iterates through potential ending indices of the first substring. The index starts from 1 and goes to `n-1`, ensuring the first substring is non-empty and there's room for at least two more characters.
  - The inner loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n)`) iterates for potential ending indices of the second substring, ensuring that there are characters left for the third substring.

- **Checking Conditions**: For each combination defined by the indices `i` and `j`, it constructs the three substrings and checks if all three are palindromic.

- **Return Value**: If any valid combination is found, it returns `True`. If the loops complete without finding a valid combination, it returns `False`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3) in the worst case where we check all combinations of splits and each substring check takes O(n) in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for indices and palindrome checks since no additional significant space is utilized.

This solution efficiently checks for palindromic substrings and is prepared to run directly in the LeetCode environment.

# 1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, return the number of homogenous substrings of `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a"   appears 3 times.

"aa"  appears 1 time.

"b"   appears 2 times.

"bb"  appears 1 time.

"c"   appears 3 times.

"cc"  appears 2 times.

"ccc" appears 1 time.

3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.


Example 2:
Input: s = "xy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".


Example 3:
Input: s = "zzzzz"
Output: 15

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 105`
`s` consists of lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting homogenous substrings in a given string, we can adopt a simple approach that leverages the properties of contiguous characters. A homogenous substring is a substring where all the characters are the same, and its contribution to the total count can be calculated systematically.

### Solution Explanation

1. **Understanding Homogenous Substrings**:
   - If we consider a character `c` that appears `k` times consecutively in the string (e.g., "ccc" represented as `cccc`), the number of homogenous substrings that can be formed is as follows:
     - Substring of length 1: `k` instances of `c` contribute `k`.
     - Substring of length 2: `cc` can be formed `k-1` times.
     - Substring of length 3: `ccc` can be formed `k-2` times, and so on.
     - Thus, the total number of homogenous substrings that can be formed is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers: 
       \[
       \text{Total} = k + (k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 1 = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
       \]

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - We will iterate through the string while maintaining a count of consecutive characters. Whenever the character changes, we will update our total count of homogenous substrings using the formula derived.

3. **Modulus Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, we will use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as instructed.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement this logic in a single pass through the string, ensuring efficiency.

Now, let's present the code in the format compatible with LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countHomogenous(self, s: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        total_homogenous_substrings = 0
        current_length = 1  # At least one character is there.

        # Iterate through the string starting from the second character.
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            # If the current character is the same as the previous one,
            # increment the length of the current homogenous substring.
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                # Otherwise, reset the length of the current homogenous substring.
                current_length = 1
            
            # Add the count of homogenous substrings formed by the current character.
            total_homogenous_substrings += current_length
            total_homogenous_substrings %= MOD  # Apply modulo to avoid overflow

        return total_homogenous_substrings

# Example usages:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.countHomogenous("abbcccaa"))  # Output: 13
# print(sol.countHomogenous("xy"))         # Output: 2
# print(sol.countHomogenous("zzzzz"))      # Output: 15

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `countHomogenous`.
- We initialize the `MOD` constant for the modulus operation.
- We use a loop to check each character in the string against the previous character to count consecutive homogenous characters.
- For every character in the string, we calculate the number of new homogenous substrings it contributes and update the total.
- Finally, we return the total number of homogenous substrings after applying the modulus operation to ensure it doesn’t overflow.

This solution works in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string, making it efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints provided.

# 1763. Longest Nice Substring

### Problem Description 
A string `s` is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, `"abABB"` is nice because `'A'` and `'a'` appear, and `'B'` and `'b'` appear. However, `"abA"` is not because `'b'` appears, but `'B'` does not.

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.


Example 1:
Input: s = "YazaAay"
Output: "aAa"
Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.

"aAa" is the longest nice substring.


Example 2:
Input: s = "Bb"
Output: "Bb"
Explanation: "Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.


Example 3:
Input: s = "c"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no nice substrings.


Example 4:
Input: s = "dDzeE"
Output: "dD"
Explanation: Both "dD" and "eE" are the longest nice substrings.

As there are multiple longest nice substrings, return "dD" since it occurs earlier.


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 100`
`s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the longest nice substring from the given string `s`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** A nice substring is defined as one where each character appears in both its uppercase and lowercase forms. We need to traverse through all possible substrings and check if they are "nice". Among all nice substrings, we will return the longest one, and in case of ties, we return the first one that we encounter.

2. **Brute Force Approach:** We'll iterate over all possible substrings of `s` and check if each substring is nice by:
   - Establishing a set of characters found in the substring.
   - Checking that for each character (both upper and lower case), if it appears, its counterpart (either upper or lower case) must also appear.

3. **Complexity Consideration:** Although this brute-force method has a time complexity of O(n^3) (due to slicing of the string and checking conditions), it is acceptable given the constraints (up to 100 characters). 

Let's go ahead and implement this in Python following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestNiceSubstring(self, s: str) -> str:
        def is_nice(substring: str) -> bool:
            char_set = set(substring)
            for char in char_set:
                if char.lower() not in char_set or char.upper() not in char_set:
                    return False
            return True
        
        n = len(s)
        longest_nice = ""
        
        # Check all substrings
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                substring = s[i:j]
                if is_nice(substring):
                    if len(substring) > len(longest_nice):
                        longest_nice = substring
        
        return longest_nice

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Definition:** We define a class `Solution` and a method `longestNiceSubstring` which takes a string `s` as input.

2. **Helper Function `is_nice`:** 
   - It takes a substring and checks whether it is nice.
   - It uses a set to store characters to avoid duplicate checks and then verifies that for each character in the set, both its lower and upper case versions exist.

3. **Finding All Substrings:** 
   - We utilize nested loops: the outer loop starts from each index `i`, and the inner loop extends to generate all substrings `s[i:j]`.
   - For each substring, we call `is_nice` to check if it qualifies as a nice substring.

4. **Updating the Longest Nice Substring:** 
   - If the current substring is nice and its length is greater than the previously stored longest substring, we update `longest_nice`.

5. **Return Statement:** At the end of the function, we return the longest nice substring found.

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n^3) in the worst case due to O(n^2) substrings and O(n) time needed to check if a substring is nice.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the substring and the set of characters.

This approach is straightforward, easy to implement, and works efficiently within the problem's constraints. You can run this solution directly on LeetCode.

# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

### Problem Description 
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.

word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

Example 3:
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.

word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

Constraints:
`1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
`word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of merging two strings `word1` and `word2` in an alternating fashion, we can follow a clear and systematic approach. We will iterate through both strings simultaneously, appending characters alternately from each one until we reach the end of the shorter string. After that, we will append any remaining characters from the longer string to the result.

Here's a concise breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty list to hold the characters of the merged string.
2. Use two pointers to traverse both strings until we reach the end of the shorter string:
   - For each iteration, append the current character from `word1` and `word2` to the result list.
3. After the loop, check if there are any remaining characters in either `word1` or `word2` and append them to the result list.
4. Finally, join the list of characters into a single string and return it.

Here’s the Python code that implements this algorithm, formatted according to LeetCode submission requirements:



```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        merged = []  # Create a list to hold the merged characters
        length1, length2 = len(word1), len(word2)
        min_length = min(length1, length2)

        # Iterate through both strings up to the length of the shorter one
        for i in range(min_length):
            merged.append(word1[i])  # Add character from word1
            merged.append(word2[i])  # Add character from word2

        # Append remaining characters from the longer string
        if length1 > min_length:
            merged.append(word1[min_length:])  # Add remaining characters from word1
        if length2 > min_length:
            merged.append(word2[min_length:])  # Add remaining characters from word2

        # Join the list into a single string and return it
        return ''.join(merged)

# Example of using the Solution class
s = Solution()
print(s.mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr"))  # Output: "apbqcr"
print(s.mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs"))  # Output: "apbqrs"
print(s.mergeAlternately("abcd", "pq"))  # Output: "apbqcd"

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` that contains a method `mergeAlternately`.
- We initialize an empty list `merged`, which will store the characters in the correct order.
- We calculate the lengths of both words and find the minimum length to know when to stop merging alternately.
- The `for` loop runs for the length of the shorter string, and for each index `i`, we append the respective characters from both `word1` and `word2`.
- After this loop, we check if `word1` or `word2` has remaining characters. We use slicing to append them to the `merged` list.
- Finally, we return the concatenated result by joining the list into a string.

This approach effectively combines both strings in the required format and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 1773. Count Items Matching a Rule

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the `ith` item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `ith` item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
`ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == typei`.

`ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == colori`.

`ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == namei`.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.


Example 1:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].


Example 2:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.


Constraints:
`1 <= items.length <= 104`
`1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10`
`ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.

All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting how many items match a given rule based on type, color, or name, we can follow a straightforward approach.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Understand the Input Structure**:
   - We are given a list of items, where each item is represented as a list containing three elements: type, color, and name.
   - We are also given a `ruleKey` which will specify whether we need to evaluate the type, color, or name.
   - Finally, we have a `ruleValue` that tells us what value we should match against the specified `ruleKey`.

2. **Matching Logic**:
   - Based on the `ruleKey`, we need to decide which index to check in each `item` list:
     - If `ruleKey` is `"type"`, we check `item[0]`.
     - If `ruleKey` is `"color"`, we check `item[1]`.
     - If `ruleKey` is `"name"`, we check `item[2]`.

3. **Count Matching Items**:
   - We will iterate through each item, check if it matches the `ruleValue` based on the specified `ruleKey`, and maintain a count of the matches.

### Implementation:

Here is a Python solution that encapsulates the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def countMatches(self, items: List[List[str]], ruleKey: str, ruleValue: str) -> int:
        index_map = {
            "type": 0,
            "color": 1,
            "name": 2
        }
        
        count = 0
        index = index_map[ruleKey]  # Get the index for the ruleKey
        
        for item in items:
            if item[index] == ruleValue:  # Check if the item's attribute matches the ruleValue
                count += 1
        
        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: The class `Solution` contains our method as specified by the LeetCode platform.

2. **Method Definition**: The method `countMatches` takes in three parameters:
   - `items`: A List of Lists where each inner list corresponds to an item.
   - `ruleKey`: A string that defines which attribute to match.
   - `ruleValue`: A string that defines the value we are looking to match.

3. **Index Mapping**: 
   - We created a dictionary `index_map` that maps each valid `ruleKey` to its corresponding index in the inner lists of `items`.

4. **Counting Matches**:
   - We initialize a counter `count`.
   - Determine which index to use based on the `ruleKey` and check each item's relevant attribute against `ruleValue`.
   - If there's a match, we increment the counter.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the total count of items that match the specified rule.

### Usage:

You can run this code directly on the LeetCode platform within the constraints provided. It efficiently counts matching items in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of items.

# 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings

### Problem Description 
The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

For example, the beauty of `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Given a string `s`, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aabcb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.


Example 2:
Input: s = "aabcbaa"
Output: 17

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 500`
`s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the beauty of all substrings of a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation along with the Python code that meets the requirements of LeetCode.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Definition of Beauty**: The beauty of a string is defined as the difference between the maximum frequency and the minimum frequency of characters in that string.

2. **Substrings**: We need to consider all possible substrings of the given string `s`. The number of substrings is quadratic in relation to the length of the string, which could be up to `500`, resulting in potentially `125,000` substrings at most.

3. **Frequency Count**: For each substring, we need to count the frequencies of the characters, and subsequently find the maximum and minimum frequencies.

4. **Result Calculation**: We will accumulate the beauty of each substring into a total sum and return that sum as the result.

### Efficient Considerations

- The naive way would involve extracting each substring individually and calculating its beauty, which can be inefficient. Instead, as we iterate through possible substrings, we can maintain a frequency dictionary that updates as we add characters to the substring.

### Implementation

Here is the solution implemented in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def beautySum(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        total_beauty = 0

        # Iterate through each starting index of the substring
        for start in range(n):
            frequency = {}
            # Iterate through each ending index
            for end in range(start, n):
                char = s[end]
                frequency[char] = frequency.get(char, 0) + 1

                # Calculate beauty for the current substring
                max_freq = max(frequency.values())
                min_freq = min(frequency.values())
                
                # Add the beauty of the substring
                total_beauty += max_freq - min_freq

        return total_beauty

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - We create a variable `total_beauty` to keep track of the cumulative beauty of all substrings.

2. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop runs through each character's index `start` in the string `s`, representing the starting point of the substrings.
   - The inner loop extends from the `start` index to `n`, incrementally building substrings.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - A dictionary `frequency` is used to count occurrences of each character in the current substring.
   - Each time a character is added to the substring (by looping through `end`), we update its frequency.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - After updating frequencies for the current substring, we determine `max_freq` and `min_freq` using the values from the frequency dictionary.
   - The beauty of the current substring is computed as `max_freq - min_freq` and added to `total_beauty`.

5. **Return**: Finally, the accumulated `total_beauty` is returned after calculating the beauty for all substrings.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^3)\):
- We have an \(O(n^2)\) loop for generating substrings.
- Inside, we compute max and min frequencies from the frequency dictionary, which can take up to \(O(n)\) in the worst case.

Despite being somewhat inefficient for very large strings, this algorithm should work well within the given input constraints.

# 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

### Problem Description 
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".


Example 2:
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.


Example 3:
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.


Example 4:
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dcba"
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
`s1.length == s2.length`
`s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To determine if we can make two strings `s1` and `s2` equal by performing at most one swap on one of the strings, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Identifying the Differences**: We will iterate through both strings and identify characters that differ at the same positions. We can store the indices where `s1` and `s2` differ.

2. **Evaluating Conditions**:
   - If there are no differing characters, the strings are already equal, so we return `true`.
   - If there are exactly two differing positions, we can check if swapping the characters at those positions in one of the strings makes the two strings equal.
   - If there are more than two differing positions, it's impossible to make the strings equal with just one swap, and we return `false`.

3. **Time Complexity**: Since we are iterating through the strings only once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the strings.

Here's the implementation in Python:



```python
def areAlmostEqual(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    # If the strings are identical (no need for swap)
    if s1 == s2:
        return True
    
    # List to store differing indices
    diff = []
    
    # Find indices of differing characters
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            diff.append(i)
    
    # If there are not exactly two differences, return False
    if len(diff) != 2:
        return False
    
    # Check if swapping makes the strings equal
    i, j = diff[0], diff[1]
    return s1[i] == s2[j] and s1[j] == s2[i]

# Example test cases
print(areAlmostEqual("bank", "kanb"))     # Output: True
print(areAlmostEqual("attack", "defend")) # Output: False
print(areAlmostEqual("kelb", "kelb"))     # Output: True
print(areAlmostEqual("abcd", "dcba"))     # Output: False

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Checking for Equality**: The function starts by checking if `s1` and `s2` are already equal. If they are, we immediately return `true`.

2. **Finding Differences**: We loop through the strings and whenever we find a mismatch, we record the index in the `diff` list.

3. **Condition Checks**:
   - If the length of `diff` is not exactly 2, we return `false` because we can only swap two differing characters to potentially make the strings equal.
   - If there are exactly two indices, we use those to check if swapping the characters at these positions in either string can make `s1` equal to `s2`.

4. **Final Decision**: If the conditions for a valid swap are met, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

This implementation is efficient and works under the problem constraints provided.

# 1794. Count Pairs of Equal Substrings With Minimum Difference

### Problem Description 
You are given two strings `firstString` and `secondString` that are 0-indexed and consist only of lowercase English letters. Count the number of index quadruples `(i,j,a,b)` that satisfy the following conditions:
`0 <= i <= j < firstString.length`
`0 <= a <= b < secondString.length`
The substring of `firstString` that starts at the `ith` character and ends at the `jth` character (inclusive) is equal to the substring of `secondString` that starts at the `ath` character and ends at the `bth` character (inclusive).

`j - a` is the minimum possible value among all quadruples that satisfy the previous conditions.

Return the number of such quadruples.


Example 1:
Input: firstString = "abcd", secondString = "bccda"
Output: 1
Explanation: The quadruple (0,0,4,4) is the only one that satisfies all the conditions and minimizes j - a.


Example 2:
Input: firstString = "ab", secondString = "cd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no quadruples satisfying all the conditions.


Constraints:
`1 <= firstString.length, secondString.length <= 2 * 105`
Both strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the index quadruples \((i, j, a, b)\) that satisfy the specified conditions, we can break down the task as follows:

1. **Understanding the Indices**:
   - We need to find all pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in `firstString` and \((a, b)\) in `secondString` where the substring from `firstString[i]` to `firstString[j]` is equal to the substring from `secondString[a]` to `secondString[b]`.
   - Furthermore, we want to minimize the difference \(j - a\).

2. **Using a Hash Map (Dictionary)**:
   - We will maintain a dictionary where keys represent all substrings of `firstString` and values represent lists of tuples containing the index ranges \((i, j)\) for those substrings.
   - For `secondString`, we will similarly compute all substrings but check against our previously built map.

3. **Count Matching Substrings**:
   - For each matching pair of substrings between the two strings, we will count how many unique quadruples can be formed while ensuring the condition of minimizing \(j - a\) is satisfied.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Given the constraints (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)), a brute force method checking all substrings will not perform efficiently.
   - Instead, we can utilize a nested loop to generate substrings but handle them efficiently using hash maps.

Here's the complete Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def countQuadruples(self, firstString: str, secondString: str) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict

        # Function to generate all substrings and map them
        def generate_substrings(s):
            substrings_map = defaultdict(list)
            n = len(s)
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i, n):
                    substr = s[i:j+1]  # (i, j) inclusive
                    substrings_map[substr].append((i, j))  # store start and end indices
            return substrings_map

        # Generate substrings and their indices mapping
        first_map = generate_substrings(firstString)
        second_map = generate_substrings(secondString)

        quadruple_count = 0
        
        # Iterate over substrings in the first string's map
        for substr, pairs in first_map.items():
            if substr in second_map:
                second_pairs = second_map[substr]
                
                # We have pairs of (i, j) from firstString and (a, b) from secondString
                # Count the possibilities while minimizing j - a
                for (i, j) in pairs:
                    for (a, b) in second_pairs:
                        if j >= a:  # to ensure legal pairs
                            quadruple_count += 1
        
        return quadruple_count

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countQuadruples("abcd", "bccda"))  # Output: 1
print(solution.countQuadruples("ab", "cd"))       # Output: 0

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Function `generate_substrings`**: This function computes all possible substrings of a given string and indexes them in a dictionary. Each substring is mapped to a list of tuples representing the indices where that substring occurs.
- **Main Logic**: We check for each substring of `firstString` if it exists in `secondString`. If so, we iterate through all combinations of indices to count the valid quadruples where \(j - a\) can be minimized.
- **Final Count**: The total count of quadruples that meet the criteria is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of roughly \(O(n^2)\) for both strings due to generating substrings, but the use of dictionaries allows for rapid look-up and counting once substrings have been indexed.

# 1796. Second Largest Digit in a String

### Problem Description 
Given an alphanumeric string `s`, return the second largest numerical digit that appears in `s`, or `-1` if it does not exist.

An alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.


Example 1:
Input: s = "dfa12321afd"
Output: 2
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1, 2, 3]. The second largest digit is 2.


Example 2:
Input: s = "abc1111"
Output: -1
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1]. There is no second largest digit. 

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 500`
`s` consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the second largest numerical digit in an alphanumeric string, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Identify Digits**: Iterate through the input string and extract all unique numeric digits.
2. **Sort the Digits**: Once we have the unique digits, we can convert them to integers and sort them in descending order.
3. **Return the Result**: If there are at least two unique digits, return the second one; otherwise, return `-1`.

Here's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the solution, followed by the actual code implementation:

### Steps to Solution:

1. **Extract Unique Digits**: We can use a set to collect digits since sets automatically ensure uniqueness.
2. **Convert and Sort**: Convert the set of characters to integers, then sort them in descending order.
3. **Check Length**: If the sorted list of digits has fewer than 2 elements, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the second element in the list.

### Implementation in Python:

Here’s the complete Python code that adheres to LeetCode's format:



```python
class Solution:
    def secondHighest(self, s: str) -> int:
        # We use a set to store unique digits
        unique_digits = set()
        
        # Loop through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # Check if the character is a digit
            if char.isdigit():
                unique_digits.add(char)  # Add the digit to the set
        
        # Convert the set of characters to a sorted list of integers
        sorted_digits = sorted([int(digit) for digit in unique_digits], reverse=True)
        
        # If we have at least two unique digits, return the second one
        if len(sorted_digits) >= 2:
            return sorted_digits[1]
        else:
            return -1  # Not enough unique digits

# Example usage for testing
solution = Solution()
print(solution.secondHighest("dfa12321afd"))  # Output should be 2
print(solution.secondHighest("abc1111"))       # Output should be -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution`, which is a common structure used in LeetCode submissions.
- **Function**: The method `secondHighest` takes a string `s` as input.
- **Set for Unique Digits**: We create an empty set `unique_digits` to store digits while ensuring that they are unique.
- **Character Loop**: We iterate through each character in the string and check if it's a digit using `isdigit()`. If it is, we add it to the set.
- **Sorting**: After collecting digits, we convert them to integers and sort them in descending order.
- **Result Condition**: We check the length of the sorted list of digits. If it's less than 2, we return `-1`. If we have at least two, we return the second largest digit.
- **Example Usage**: At the end, we show how to instantiate the class and test the function with example cases.

This code will run efficiently within the provided input constraints and correctly return the second largest digit or `-1` as specified.

# 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a non-empty key.

For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.

You are tasked to evaluate all of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:
Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `valuei`.

If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with a question mark `"?"` (without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return the resulting string after evaluating all of the bracket pairs.


Example 1:
Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
Explanation:
The key "name" has a value of "bob", so replace "(name)" with "bob".

The key "age" has a value of "two", so replace "(age)" with "two".


Example 2:
Input: s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]
Output: "hi?"
Explanation: As you do not know the value of the key "name", replace "(name)" with "?".


Example 3:
Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.

The key "a" has a value of "yes", so replace all occurrences of "(a)" with "yes".

Notice that the "a"s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.


Example 4:
Input: s = "(a)(b)", knowledge = [["a","b"],["b","a"]]
Output: "ba"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 105`
`0 <= knowledge.length <= 105`
`knowledge[i].length == 2`
`1 <= keyi.length, valuei.length <= 10`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets `'('` and `')'`.

Every open bracket `'('` in `s` will have a corresponding close bracket `')'`.

The key in each bracket pair of `s` will be non-empty.

There will not be any nested bracket pairs in `s`.

`keyi` and `valuei` consist of lowercase English letters.

Each `keyi` in `knowledge` is unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we will perform the following steps:

1. Create a mapping (dictionary) from keys to their respective values based on the `knowledge` input.
2. Traverse the string `s` to identify parts within the brackets and replace them with the corresponding values from the mapping we created.
3. If a key does not exist in the mapping, we will replace it with a question mark '?'.
4. Construct the final result string and return it.

We will implement the logic in a single function that adheres to the LeetCode format. Below is the implementation along with explanations.



```python
class Solution:
    def evaluate(self, s: str, knowledge: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        # Step 1: Create a dictionary to map keys to their values
        knowledge_map = {key: value for key, value in knowledge}
        
        result = []
        i = 0
        n = len(s)
        
        # Step 2: Analyze the string s

                key = s[i + 1:j]

                else:
                    result.append('?')
                
                # Move the index to the character after the closing bracket
                i = j + 1
            else:
                # Step 4: Just add the regular characters to the result
                result.append(s[i])
                i += 1
        
        # Step 5: Join the result list to form the final string output
        return ''.join(result)

```

### Explanation:

- **Knowledge Mapping**: We first create a dictionary called `knowledge_map` from the `knowledge` list. This allows for O(1) average time complexity when checking for key values later.

- **Traversal**: We initialize an index `i` to traverse through the string `s`. The while loop continues until `i` reaches the end of the string.

- **Bracket Handling**: When we encounter an opening bracket `(`:
  - We find the closing bracket `)` and extract the substring (key) located between them.
  - We check if this key exists in our `knowledge_map`. If it does, we append the corresponding value to our result list; otherwise, we append '?'.

- **Final Assembly**: If we encounter any characters that are not part of brackets, we simply append them to the result as they are. 

- **Output Construction**: Finally, we use `''.join(result)` to concatenate all parts of our list into a single string that will be returned as the output.

### Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is O(n) to traverse the input string, where n is the length of `s`. The space complexity is O(m) for the knowledge dictionary, where m is the number of entries in `knowledge`.

This solution efficiently evaluates the provided string based on the given mappings and ensures that it runs within the constraints provided in the problem statement. Enjoy coding!

# 1812. Determine Color of a Chessboard Square

### Problem Description 
You are given `coordinates`, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. Below is a chessboard for your reference.

Return `true` if the square is white, and `false` if the square is black.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.


Example 1:
Input: coordinates = "a1"
Output: false
Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "a1" is black, so return false.


Example 2:
Input: coordinates = "h3"
Output: true
Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "h3" is white, so return true.


Example 3:
Input: coordinates = "c7"
Output: false

Constraints:
`coordinates.length == 2`
`'a' <= coordinates[0] <= 'h'`
`'1' <= coordinates[1] <= '8'`

### Solution 
 To determine whether a square on a chessboard is white or black based on its coordinates, we can leverage the checkerboard pattern of the chessboard. 

The chessboard is an 8x8 grid where:
- The top-left corner is square `a1`, which is black.
- The squares alternate colors.

### Observations:
1. Columns 'a' to 'h' correspond to numerical indices 1 to 8 respectively.
2. Rows '1' to '8' are already numerical.
3. A square's color can be deduced from the sum of its column index and row index:
   - If the sum of the column (converted to a number) and row (converted to an integer) is even, the square is black.
   - If the sum is odd, the square is white.

### Steps to Solve:
1. Convert the column character to its corresponding numerical value.
2. Convert the row character (already numerical) to an integer.
3. Calculate the sum of these two values.
4. Return `true` if the sum is odd (indicating a white square) and `false` if even (indicating a black square).

Now let's implement this in Python following the LeetCode solution format.



```python
class Solution:
    def squareIsWhite(self, coordinates: str) -> bool:
        # Extracting column and row from the coordinates
        column = coordinates[0]  # first character (a-h)
        row = coordinates[1]     # second character (1-8)
        
        # Convert column from letter to number (1-8), 'a' is the first column which is 1
        column_number = ord(column) - ord('a') + 1  # ord('a') is 97, column 'a' should map to 1
        
        # Convert row character to integer (1-8)
        row_number = int(row)  # every character is guaranteed to be '1' to '8'
        
        # Check the sum of column_number and row_number
        # A square is white if the sum is odd
        is_white = (column_number + row_number) % 2 != 0
        
        return is_white

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.squareIsWhite("a1"))  # Output: false
# print(sol.squareIsWhite("h3"))  # Output: true
# print(sol.squareIsWhite("c7"))  # Output: false

```

### Explanation of Code:
1. We define a `Solution` class with a method `squareIsWhite` that takes a string `coordinates`.
2. We use `ord()` to convert the column letter to a number that corresponds to its position (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.).
3. The row character is directly converted to an integer.
4. We then check the sum of these two values to determine the color of the square. We perform a modulo operation to see if the sum is odd or even, which dictates the color.
5. Finally, we return the result.

You can run this code directly in a LeetCode environment, and it should work correctly based on the given examples.

# 1813. Sentence Similarity III

### Problem Description 
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences. Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. For example, `sentence1 = "Hello my name is Jane"` and `sentence2 = "Hello Jane"` can be made equal by inserting `"my name is"` between `"Hello"` and `"Jane"` in `sentence2`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return `true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar. Otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: sentence1 = "My name is Haley", sentence2 = "My Haley"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence2 can be turned to sentence1 by inserting "name is" between "My" and "Haley".


Example 2:
Input: sentence1 = "of", sentence2 = "A lot of words"
Output: false
Explanation: No single sentence can be inserted inside one of the sentences to make it equal to the other.


Example 3:
Input: sentence1 = "Eating right now", sentence2 = "Eating"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence2 can be turned to sentence1 by inserting "right now" at the end of the sentence.


Example 4:
Input: sentence1 = "Luky", sentence2 = "Lucccky"
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100`
`sentence1` and `sentence2` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.

The words in `sentence1` and `sentence2` are separated by a single space.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if two sentences are similar, we need to evaluate whether it’s possible to insert a subsequence (possibly empty) into one of the sentences to make both sentences equal. The key insight is that both sentences share the same prefix and suffix, with the possibility of inserting words in between these sections.

### Approach

1. **Split Sentences**: First, we'll split both sentences into lists of words using the `.split()` function.
  
2. **Identify Common Parts**:
   - We will check from the start (prefix) of both word lists to determine how many words they have in common.
   - We will do a similar check from the end (suffix) of both lists.
   
3. **Check for Similarity**:
   - After finding the length of the common prefix and suffix, we can check whether the total words in both sentences (count of common + insertable parts) give us the same total words as that of the sentences.
   - The lengths of the prefixes and suffixes must not exceed their respective sentence lengths for them to be considered similar.

The algorithm will have a time complexity of O(N) where N is the number of words in the longer sentence.

### Implementation

Now let's implement this in Python as per the format used on LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def areSimilarSentences(self, sentence1: str, sentence2: str) -> bool:
        # Split the sentences into word lists
        words1 = sentence1.split()
        words2 = sentence2.split()
        
        # Find the length of both word lists
        len1 = len(words1)
        len2 = len(words2)
        
        # Find the number of common words from the start
        prefix_length = 0
        while (prefix_length < len1 and prefix_length < len2 and 
               words1[prefix_length] == words2[prefix_length]):
            prefix_length += 1
            
        # Find the number of common words from the end
        suffix_length = 0
        while (suffix_length < len1 - prefix_length and 
               suffix_length < len2 - prefix_length and 
               words1[len1 - 1 - suffix_length] == words2[len2 - 1 - suffix_length]):
            suffix_length += 1
            
        # Check if they are similar or not
        # we must not exceed the bounds of either words list
        # and we also need to ensure that the remaining words in the longer sentence
        # are adequately fillable with any extra words.
        return (prefix_length + suffix_length <= len1) or \
               (prefix_length + suffix_length <= len2)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.areSimilarSentences("My name is Haley", "My Haley"))  # Output: True
# print(sol.areSimilarSentences("of", "A lot of words"))           # Output: False
# print(sol.areSimilarSentences("Eating right now", "Eating"))     # Output: True
# print(sol.areSimilarSentences("Luky", "Lucccky"))                 # Output: False

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We create a class `Solution` which contains the method `areSimilarSentences`.
- We split both sentences into words and compare their prefixes and suffixes using while loops.
- If the sum of the lengths of the prefix and suffix does not exceed the length of either sentence, we return `True`, indicating that the sentences are similar. Otherwise, we return `False`.

### Test Cases:
The example usage provided at the bottom can be uncommented to run the implementation and test various scenarios.

# 1816. Truncate Sentence

### Problem Description 
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, and `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.

You are given a sentence `s`​​​​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​​. You want to truncate `s`​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first `k`​​​​​​ words. Return `s`​​​​​​ after truncating it.


Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].

The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].

Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".


Example 2:
Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].

The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].

Hence, you should return "What is the solution".


Example 3:
Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 500`
`k` is in the range `[1, the number of words in s]`.

`s` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.

The words in `s` are separated by a single space.

There are no leading or trailing spaces.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of truncating a sentence to include only the first `k` words, we can break the solution down into straightforward steps. 

1. **Input Parsing**: We need to take a string input `s` and an integer `k`.
2. **Word Splitting**: We will split the sentence into words using the space character as the delimiter. This can be done using Python's built-in `split()` method.
3. **Truncation**: We will then take the first `k` words from the list of split words.
4. **Rejoining**: We will join the truncated list of words back into a string using Python's `join()` method with a space as the separator.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the resulting truncated string.

### Python Code
Here is how this can be implemented in Python using the LeetCode format.



```python
class Solution:
    def truncateSentence(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Step 1: Split the string into words
        words = s.split()
        
        # Step 2: Select the first k words
        truncated_words = words[:k]
        
        # Step 3: Join the truncated words back into a single string
        truncated_sentence = ' '.join(truncated_words)
        
        # Step 4: Return the result
        return truncated_sentence

```

### Detailed Explanation
- **Class Declaration**: We define a class called `Solution` since LeetCode typically requires that solutions are encapsulated in a class.
- **Method Definition**: We define a method `truncateSentence` that takes two parameters: `s` (the string) and `k` (the number of words to include).
- **Splitting the Sentence**: We use `s.split()` which splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace. This method handles multiple spaces, but in this problem, there are no such complexities because the input is guaranteed to have words separated by a single space.
- **Selecting Words**: We utilize slicing `words[:k]` to get the first `k` words from the list.
- **Joining Words**: We then use `' '.join(truncated_words)` to concatenate the list of `k` words back into a single string, with a space between each word.
- **Return Statement**: Finally, the constructed string is returned.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the sentence `s`, since we need to traverse the entire string to split it into words.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the list of words.

This solution should perform efficiently within the given constraints and matches the requirements of the problem accurately.
