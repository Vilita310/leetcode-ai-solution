# 1660. Correct a Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is exactly one invalid node where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the same depth but to the invalid node's right.

Given the root of the binary tree with this defect, `root`, return the root of the binary tree after removing this invalid node and every node underneath it (minus the node it incorrectly points to).

Custom testing:
The test input is read as 3 lines:
`TreeNode root`
`int fromNode` (not available to `correctBinaryTree`)
`int toNode` (not available to `correctBinaryTree`)
After the binary tree rooted at `root` is parsed, the `TreeNode` with value of `fromNode` will have its right child pointer pointing to the `TreeNode` with a value of `toNode`. Then, `root` is passed to `correctBinaryTree`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3], fromNode = 2, toNode = 3
Output: [1,null,3]
Explanation: The node with value 2 is invalid, so remove it.


Example 2:
Input: root = [8,3,1,7,null,9,4,2,null,null,null,5,6], fromNode = 7, toNode = 4
Output: [8,3,1,null,null,9,4,null,null,5,6]
Explanation: The node with value 7 is invalid, so remove it and the node underneath it, node 2.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[3, 104]`.

`-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
All `Node.val` are unique.

`fromNode != toNode`
`fromNode` and `toNode` will exist in the tree and will be on the same depth.

`toNode` is to the right of `fromNode`.

`fromNode.right` is `null` in the initial tree from the test data.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of removing an invalid node from a binary tree where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the same depth, we can approach the problem using a depth-first traversal. The idea is to find the node that is incorrectly pointing to another node and restructure the tree accordingly.

Here's how we would typically structure our solution in Python, adhering to the LeetCode format:

1. Parse the tree from input.
2. Identify the invalid node based on the provided values `fromNode` and `toNode`.
3. Remove the invalid node and reconnect its parent appropriately.
4. Ensure that any children of the invalid node are also removed.

The structure of the solution in Python is as follows:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def correctBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode, fromNode: int, toNode: int) -> TreeNode:
        # Use a dictionary to keep track of parent-child relationships
        parent_map = {}
        
        # Helper function for DFS to build parent links
        def dfs(node, parent):
            if not node:
                return
            parent_map[node.val] = parent
            dfs(node.left, node)
            dfs(node.right, node)

        # Start DFS from root to build the parent map
        dfs(root, None)

        # The invalid node is `fromNode` and we want to point its parent to `toNode`
        invalid_node = fromNode
        valid_child = toNode

        # Find the parent of `invalid_node` from our map
        parent_of_invalid = parent_map[invalid_node]

        # Remove the invalid node
        if parent_of_invalid:
            if parent_of_invalid.left and parent_of_invalid.left.val == invalid_node:
                parent_of_invalid.left = None  # Remove from left
            if parent_of_invalid.right and parent_of_invalid.right.val == invalid_node:
                parent_of_invalid.right = valid_child  # Redirect to valid child

        # Return the new root of the tree
        return root

```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **TreeNode Class**: This is a simple class for representing nodes in a binary tree. Each node has a value and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **DFS Traversal**: We perform a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and map each node's parent in the `parent_map`. This will allow us to identify the parent of the invalid node easily.

3. **Removing the Invalid Node**:
   - Once we find the invalid node (`fromNode`), we check its parent.
   - The parent's left or right child will be set to `None` for the invalid node itself, and if it exists, it will be redirected to `toNode`, which is valid.

4. **Returning the Root**: After modifying the tree, we return the original root. The changes will have been made to its children, transforming the tree structure as required.

### Important Points:
- The constraints ensure that `fromNode` and `toNode` will always exist and are on the same depth; hence, the logic is simplified.
- The solution is efficient and runs in O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, due to the single traversal to build the parent map followed by a constant time operation to adjust pointers.

You can run this solution directly within the LeetCode environment and use the provided input format to create the binary tree before calling the `correctBinaryTree` method.

# 1666. Change the Root of a Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree and a `leaf` node, reroot the tree so that the `leaf` is the new root.

You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path starting from the `leaf` up to the `root`​​​ excluding the root:
If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child.

`cur`'s original parent becomes `cur`'s left child. Note that in this process the original parent's pointer to `cur` becomes `null`, making it have at most one child.

Return the new root of the rerooted tree.

Note: Ensure that your solution sets the `Node.parent` pointers correctly after rerooting or you will receive "Wrong Answer".


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 7
Output: [7,2,null,5,4,3,6,null,null,null,1,null,null,0,8]

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 0
Output: [0,1,null,3,8,5,null,null,null,6,2,null,null,7,4]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.

`-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
All `Node.val` are unique.

`leaf` exist in the tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rerooting a binary tree at a given leaf node, we need to understand the structure of a binary tree and the relationships between nodes.

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Understanding the Node Structure**: Each node in the binary tree has pointers to its left child, right child, and parent. This will help us navigate the tree easily.

2. **Find the Leaf Node**: We are given a specific leaf node, and we need to reroot the tree around it. Hence, we need to backtrack from the given leaf node to the root, adjusting the pointers according to the rerooting rules provided.

3. **Rerooting Process**:
   - For each node `cur` encountered during the path from the leaf up to the root (excluding the root):
     - If `cur` has a left child, that child becomes `cur`'s right child.
     - `cur`'s parent becomes `cur`'s left child.
   - After complete traversal, the last encountered node will become the new root of the tree.

4. **Returning the New Tree's Root**: After rerooting, we need to return the new root node.

Now, let's implement the above logic in Python according to LeetCode's format. We'll define a `TreeNode` class as well as a function that reroots the tree:



```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, parent=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = parent

class Solution:
    def reroot(self, root: TreeNode, leaf: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # This function will reroot the binary tree to the given leaf
        cur = leaf
        
        while cur.parent is not None:
            parent = cur.parent
            
            # If current node has a left child, it becomes the right child of the current node
            if cur.left:
                parent.right = cur.left
                cur.left.parent = parent
            
            # Reassign parent to current node's left child
            cur.left = parent
            
            # Set parent to None as `cur` is no longer a child of parent
            cur.parent = None
            
            # Move to the next node up the tree
            cur = parent
        
        return leaf  # The leaf node is now the new root

# Implementation of Helper Functions to Build Tree (not required in LeetCode, but useful for testing)
def build_tree_from_list(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    root = TreeNode(values[0])
    queue = [root]
    i = 1
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if i < len(values) and values[i] is not None:
            node.left = TreeNode(values[i], parent=node)
            queue.append(node.left)
        i += 1
        if i < len(values) and values[i] is not None:
            node.right = TreeNode(values[i], parent=node)
            queue.append(node.right)
        i += 1
    return root

def print_tree(root):
    if not root:
        return "[]"
    result = []
    queue = [root]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node:
            result.append(node.val)
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
        else:
            result.append(None)
    # Strip off the trailing None values
    while result and result[-1] is None:
        result.pop()
    return result

```

### Explanation of the Code Components:
1. **TreeNode Class**: Represents each node in the tree with `val`, `left`, `right`, and `parent`.
2. **reroot Function**: Implements the logic for rerooting the tree as discussed.
3. **build_tree_from_list**: Helper function to construct the tree from a list (not necessary for LeetCode submissions but useful for local testing).
4. **print_tree**: Helper function to visualize the tree structure (not necessary for LeetCode submissions).

### How to Use it:
1. Instantiate a `Solution` object.
2. Build the tree using `build_tree_from_list`.
3. Call the `reroot` method with the root and leaf node.
4. Use `print_tree` to visualize the new tree structure. 

This code is ready to run on LeetCode, following their required input/output format.

# 1676. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree IV

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an array of `TreeNode` objects `nodes`, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all the nodes in `nodes`. All the nodes will exist in the tree, and all values of the tree's nodes are unique.

Extending the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of `n` nodes `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has every `pi` as a descendant (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself) for every valid `i`". A descendant of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of nodes 4 and 7 is node 2.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of a single node is the node itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [7,6,2,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of the nodes 7, 6, 2, and 4 is node 5.


Example 4:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 3
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of all the nodes is the root node.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
All `Node.val` are unique.

All `nodes[i]` will exist in the tree.

All `nodes[i]` are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of a given list of `TreeNode` objects in a binary tree, we can leverage a depth-first search (DFS) strategy. Below is a detailed explanation of how we can implement the solution, formatted as it would be in a LeetCode solution.

### Approach

1. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a DFS traversal to search for the nodes in the `nodes` list. During this traversal, we will:
   - Check if the current node is one of the nodes we are looking for.
   - Recursively search through the left and right subtrees.
   - If both left and right children return a non-null result, it means the current node is their LCA.
   - If one of the children returns a non-null result, we return that result up the recursive call stack.

2. **Result Handling**: At the base of our recursive function:
   - If the node is `None`, return `None`.
   - If the node's value is in the `nodes` list, return this node.

3. **Global Reference**: We will maintain a global variable to hold the LCA once it is found.

### Implementation

Here is the Python code that follows the LeetCode format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, nodes: List[TreeNode]) -> TreeNode:
        # Create a set for fast lookup
        node_set = set(node.val for node in nodes)
        
        # This will hold the lowest common ancestor
        self.lca = None
        
        def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> bool:
            if not node:
                return False
            
            # Count how many nodes from the input list are found in the current subtree
            left_found = dfs(node.left)
            right_found = dfs(node.right)
            current_found = node.val in node_set
            
            # If the current node is the LCA
            if (left_found + right_found + current_found) > 1:
                self.lca = node
            
            # Return true if this node is one of the nodes we're looking for
            return left_found or right_found or current_found
        
        # Start DFS from the root
        dfs(root)
        
        return self.lca


```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **TreeNode Class**: We start by defining the `TreeNode` class that represents each node in the binary tree.
- **Solution Class**: The `Solution` class contains the method `lowestCommonAncestor` which takes the `root` of the tree and the list of `nodes`.
- **Node Set**: We create a set called `node_set` from the values of `nodes` for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function:
  - Returns `True` if it finds a target node within the current subtree rooted at `node`.
  - Updates the LCA if more than one target node is found in the left/right children and the current node.
- **Return Statement**: Finally, we call `dfs` on the root and return the LCA once we have traversed the tree.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack in a DFS.

This effectively gives us a solution to find the LCA of all nodes in `nodes` within a binary tree.

# 1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [xi, yi]`, and:
There are no duplicates.

`xi < yi`
Let `ways` be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:
The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in `pairs`.

A pair `[xi, yi]` exists in `pairs` if and only if `xi` is an ancestor of `yi` or `yi` is an ancestor of `xi`.

Note: the tree does not have to be a binary tree.

Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:
`0` if `ways == 0`
`1` if `ways == 1`
`2` if `ways > 1`
A rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.


Example 1:
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.


Example 2:
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.


Example 3:
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[1,5]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no valid rooted trees.


Constraints:
`1 <= pairs.length <= 105`
`1 <= xi < yi <= 500`
The elements in `pairs` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting valid rooted trees based on the given pairs of nodes, we need to follow several steps. Let's break down the approach and then I will provide the Python code in the format suitable for LeetCode.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Understanding Relationships**: Since each pair \( [x_i, y_i] \) denotes a potential ancestor relationship, we need to determine directed relationships from the pairs. Specifically, if \( x < y \), then \( x \) can be an ancestor of \( y \).

2. **Build a Directed Graph**: We will create a directed graph from the pairs, represented using adjacency lists. Each node will point to its children.

3. **Count In-Degrees**: For every node, we will count how many parents (in-degrees) it has. This is crucial because:
   - A valid root node will have an in-degree of 0.
   - If any node has an in-degree greater than 1, it means there are multiple potential parents for that node, making it impossible to form a valid tree.

4. **Check for Valid Roots**: If we have exactly one root (i.e., one node with in-degree 0), we can further check if the remaining nodes are connected (i.e., form a single tree).

5. **Count Trees**: If we can have valid rooted trees:
   - If there is exactly one valid configuration, return 1.
   - If more than one configuration is possible, return 2.

6. **Output the Result**: Depending on the above checks, return 0, 1, or 2.

Here’s the implementation of the above steps in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, pairs):
        from collections import defaultdict

        # Step 1: Create adjacency lists and in-degree counts
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        in_degree = defaultdict(int)
        nodes = set()  # To track all unique nodes

        for x, y in pairs:
            # y is a child of x
            graph[x].append(y)
            in_degree[y] += 1
            nodes.add(x)
            nodes.add(y)

        # Step 2: Find all nodes with in-degree of 0 (potential roots)
        root_candidates = [node for node in nodes if in_degree[node] == 0]

        # Step 3: Validity checks
        # 1. There must be exactly one root node
        if len(root_candidates) != 1:
            return 0  # Either no root or multiple roots

        # 2. Check if exactly one rooted tree can be formed with DFS/BFS
        root = root_candidates[0]
        visited = set()
        
        def dfs(node):
            visited.add(node)
            for child in graph[node]:
                if child not in visited:
                    dfs(child)

        # Perform DFS starting from the root
        dfs(root)

        # If all nodes are visited, there is exactly one valid tree
        if len(visited) == len(nodes):
            return 1  # One valid tree
        else:
            return 0  # Not all nodes are connected, thus invalid

# Usage:
# solution = Solution()
# result = solution.countPairs([[1,2],[2,3]])
# print(result)  # Output would be 1 in this case

```

### Explanation of the Code
- We use `defaultdict` for both `graph` to hold the tree relationships and `in_degree` to count the number of parents for each node.
- We identify potential roots (nodes with in-degree 0) and perform a DFS to check connectivity from that root.
- Finally, we assess if a valid rooted tree can be formed and return the appropriate result.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints given, ensuring that the operations stay within feasible limits for the input size.

# 1740. Find Distance in a Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the root of a binary tree and two integers `p` and `q`, return the distance between the nodes of value `p` and value `q` in the tree.

The distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the path from one to the other.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 edges between 5 and 0: 5-3-1-0.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 edges between 5 and 7: 5-2-7.


Example 3:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: The distance between a node and itself is 0.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 109`
All `Node.val` are unique.

`p` and `q` are values in the tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the distance between two nodes in a binary tree, we can break the solution down into several steps. We'll use a depth-first search (DFS) to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes, `p` and `q`. The distance between the two nodes can then be calculated by finding the distance from the LCA to each of the nodes.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**:
   - The LCA of two nodes in a binary tree is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both nodes. This can be determined using a recursive DFS traversal. If we reach either `p` or `q`, we return that node up the call stack; otherwise, we return the node if it is the LCA of `p` and `q`.

2. **Calculate Distance**:
   - Once we have found the LCA, we can calculate the distance between the LCA and `p`, and the LCA and `q`. The distance between two nodes can also be found using DFS by counting the number of edges in the path.

3. **Return the Sum of Distances**:
   - The total distance between `p` and `q` is simply the sum of the two distances calculated above.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation of the outlined approach in Python, formatted for LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def findDistance(self, root: TreeNode, p: int, q: int) -> int:
        # Helper function to find the LCA of p and q
        def lca(node):
            if not node:
                return None
            if node.val == p or node.val == q:
                return node
            
            left = lca(node.left)
            right = lca(node.right)
            
            if left and right:
                return node
            return left if left else right
        
        # Helper function to calculate depth
        def depth(node, target, current_depth):
            if not node:
                return -1
            if node.val == target:
                return current_depth
            
            left_depth = depth(node.left, target, current_depth + 1)
            if left_depth != -1:
                return left_depth
            
            right_depth = depth(node.right, target, current_depth + 1)
            return right_depth
        
        # Step 1: Find the LCA of p and q
        ancestor = lca(root)
        
        # Step 2: Calculate distance from the LCA to p and q
        distance_p = depth(ancestor, p, 0)
        distance_q = depth(ancestor, q, 0)

        # The total distance between p and q
        return distance_p + distance_q

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This class defines the structure of the tree nodes.
  
2. **findDistance Method**:
   - The method takes the root of the binary tree and the values of nodes `p` and `q`.

3. **lca Function**: 
   - This function performs a post-order traversal to find the LCA of `p` and `q`. 
   - If it finds either node, it returns that node. If it finds both `p` and `q` in the left and right subtrees, it returns the current node as the LCA.

4. **depth Function**:
   - This helper function calculates the depth (or distance) of a given target node from a starting node. It returns the current depth if the target is found, otherwise, it continues the search in the left and right subtree.

5. **Calculating Total Distance**: After finding the LCA, we calculate the distances from the LCA to `p` and `q` and return their sum.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes. We traverse each node.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive call stack.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the problem's constraints while providing a clear and systematic approach to solving the problem.

# 1766. Tree of Coprimes

### Problem Description 
There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node `0`.

To represent this tree, you are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `edges`. Each `nums[i]` represents the `ith` node's value, and each `edges[j] = [uj, vj]` represents an edge between nodes `uj` and `vj` in the tree.

Two values `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

An ancestor of a node `i` is any other node on the shortest path from node `i` to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.

Return an array `ans` of size `n`, where `ans[i]` is the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime, or `-1` if there is no such ancestor.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [-1,0,0,1]
Explanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.

- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.

- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).

- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's
  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.

- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its
  closest valid ancestor.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,6,10,2,3,6,15], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]
Output: [-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1]

Constraints:
`nums.length == n`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
`1 <= n <= 105`
`edges.length == n - 1`
`edges[j].length == 2`
`0 <= uj, vj < n`
`uj != vj`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the closest ancestor with a coprime value in a tree structure, we approach the solution with a depth-first search (DFS) strategy. Below is a step-by-step explanation followed by the complete Python code formatted in a way suitable for direct upload to LeetCode:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using the edges provided. We will convert this list of edges into an adjacency list for easier traversal.
  
2. **Understanding Ancestors**:
   - Starting from any given node, its ancestors are all nodes from the current node to the root. We will keep track of these ancestors using a DFS approach.

3. **Coprime Check**:
   - Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. We'll use Python's built-in `math.gcd` for this purpose.

4. **Result Storage**:
   - We will maintain an answer list where each index corresponds to a node and store the closest ancestor that meets the coprimality condition. If no such ancestor exists, we will store `-1`.

5. **DFS Function**:
   - The DFS function will:
     - Traverse down the tree,
     - Check the coprimality of ancestors with the current node,
     - Update the answer for the current node accordingly.

### Implementation

Here’s a Python implementation reflecting the above logic:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def coprimeAncestors(self, nums: List[int], edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Build adjacency list for the tree
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # This will hold the result for each node
        ans = [-1] * n
        
        # A DFS function to traverse the tree
        def dfs(node, parent, ancestors):
            # Check coprimality with each ancestor stored in ancestors
            for ancestor in reversed(ancestors):
                if gcd(nums[node], nums[ancestor]) == 1:
                    ans[node] = ancestor
                    break

            # Add the current node to the ancestors list
            ancestors.append(node)
            
            # Continue DFS for all children (neighbors)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:  # Avoid going back to parent
                    dfs(neighbor, node, ancestors)
            
            # Backtrack: remove the current node from ancestors list
            ancestors.pop()

        # Start DFS from the root node which is 0, with no parent, and empty ancestor list
        dfs(0, -1, [])
        
        return ans

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Graph Construction**:
  - We construct the graph using a default dictionary to hold adjacency lists for each node efficiently.

- **DFS Function**:
  - The `dfs` function traverses the tree:
    - For each node, it checks all ancestors for coprimality and assigns the closest valid ancestor to the `ans` list.
    - It tracks its own ancestors by appending itself to the `ancestors` list before going deeper and pops it afterward for backtracking.

- **Coprimality Check**:
  - The check is performed using `gcd`. If a coprime ancestor is found, it is assigned immediately and no further checks are needed for that node.

### Conclusion

This code efficiently finds the closest coprime ancestor for each node in a tree structure while respecting memory and time constraints typically posed by competitive coding environments like LeetCode. The overall time complexity is O(n), due to the DFS traversal, which is optimal for this problem size.
