# 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to minimize the absolute difference `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return the minimum possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.

This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.

The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
Output: 7

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 40`
`-107 <= nums[i] <= 107`
`-109 <= goal <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding a subsequence of an array such that the sum of its elements is as close as possible to a given goal, we can use a technique known as "meet in the middle". This technique works well for problems involving subsets, particularly when the length of the array is moderate, which is the case here (maximum length of 40).

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Subsequence Definition**: A subsequence allows elements to be chosen non-contiguously from the array. This means we can pick any combination of elements, including choosing none.

2. **Computation of Sums**: Given the constraints, we can split the array into two halves and calculate all possible sums of subsequences for each half. By doing so, we can reduce the complexity of checking all possible subsets, which would otherwise be \(O(2^n)\).

3. **Minimizing the Difference**: Once we have all possible sums from both halves, we can use binary search to efficiently find the best combination of sums from both halves that minimizes the absolute difference to the `goal`.

### Steps:
1. **Divide the array**: Split the input array `nums` into two halves.
2. **Generate Subset Sums**: For each half, generate all possible sums of subsequences and store them in lists.
3. **Sort and Search**: Sort one of the lists of sums. For each sum from the other list, use binary search to find the best candidate sum from the sorted list that brings the total closest to the `goal`.
4. **Calculate Minimum Difference**: During the search, calculate the minimum absolute difference between the sums and the goal.

### Python Code

Here's how we can implement this:



```python
from itertools import combinations
import bisect

class Solution:
    def minAbsDifference(self, nums: list[int], goal: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        half = n // 2
        
        # Function to generate all possible sums of subsequences for a given array
        def generate_sums(arr):
            sums = []
            for r in range(len(arr) + 1):
                for comb in combinations(arr, r):
                    sums.append(sum(comb))
            return sums
        
        # Split the nums into two halves
        left_part = nums[:half]
        right_part = nums[half:]
        
        # Generate all possible sums for both parts
        left_sums = generate_sums(left_part)
        right_sums = generate_sums(right_part)
        
        # Sort the right sums to allow binary search
        right_sums.sort()
        
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        # Check every possible sum in the left sums
        for left_sum in left_sums:
            target = goal - left_sum
            
            # Use binary search to find the closest sum in right_sums
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(right_sums, target)
            
            # Check the closest sums on both sides of the index
            if idx < len(right_sums):
                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs((left_sum + right_sums[idx]) - goal))
            if idx > 0:
                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs((left_sum + right_sums[idx - 1]) - goal))
        
        return min_diff

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by defining the `minAbsDifference` method, which takes the list of numbers and the goal.
- We split the `nums` array into two parts, `left_part` and `right_part`.
- The `generate_sums` function uses combinations from the `itertools` module to compute every possible subsequence sum.
- We store the sums for each half and sort the sums from the right part to prepare for binary search.
- For every sum in `left_sums`, we calculate what sum we need from the right to get close to `goal`. We use `bisect.bisect_left` to perform a binary search for the best match.
- Finally, we calculate the minimum absolute difference and return it.

### Complexity:
The time complexity is approximately \(O(2^{n/2} \log(2^{n/2}))\), which is feasible for \(n \leq 40\), making this an efficient solution for the given problem constraints.
