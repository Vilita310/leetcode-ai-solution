# 1449. Form Largest Integer With Digits That Add up to Target

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `cost` and an integer `target`. Return the maximum integer you can paint under the following rules:
The cost of painting a digit (i+1) is given by `cost[i]` (0 indexed).

The total cost used must be equal to `target`.

Integer does not have digits 0.

Since the answer may be too large, return it as string.

If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return "0".


Example 1:
Input: cost = [4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5], target = 9
Output: "7772"
Explanation:  The cost to paint the digit '7' is 2, and the digit '2' is 3. Then cost("7772") = 2*3+ 3*1 = 9. You could also paint "977", but "7772" is the largest number.

Digit    cost
  1  ->   4
  2  ->   3
  3  ->   2
  4  ->   5
  5  ->   6
  6  ->   7
  7  ->   2
  8  ->   5
  9  ->   5

Example 2:
Input: cost = [7,6,5,5,5,6,8,7,8], target = 12
Output: "85"
Explanation: The cost to paint the digit '8' is 7, and the digit '5' is 5. Then cost("85") = 7 + 5 = 12.


Example 3:
Input: cost = [2,4,6,2,4,6,4,4,4], target = 5
Output: "0"
Explanation: It's not possible to paint any integer with total cost equal to target.


Example 4:
Input: cost = [6,10,15,40,40,40,40,40,40], target = 47
Output: "32211"

Constraints:
`cost.length == 9`
`1 <= cost[i] <= 5000`
`1 <= target <= 5000`

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem of painting the maximum integer under specified cost constraints, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach, followed by the complete code that can be run directly on the LeetCode platform.

### Problem Explanation
- You have a list `cost` of length 9, where each element represents the cost of painting the digits from 1 to 9 (i.e., `cost[i]` corresponds to the cost of painting digit `i+1`).
- You are given a `target` which represents the exact total cost you must use to paint the digits.
- The goal is to maximize the number formed by the painted digits, under the constraint that their total cost equals `target`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: 
    - Use a DP array where `dp[i]` will store the maximum number you can form with a total cost of `i`.
    - Initialize `dp[0] = ""` (indicating that with zero cost, we can form an empty number) and all other values to a very small string (`"-1"` or similar).
  
2. **Filling the DP Table**: 
    - Iterate through every possible cost from 1 to `target`.
    - For each cost, iterate over all digits (1 to 9) and check if it's possible to use that digit to achieve the current cost:
        - If using the digit keeps the total cost within the target (`current_cost - cost[digit - 1] >= 0`), then update the dp value if forming this number with the current digit is greater than what is already stored (`dp[current_cost] < dp[current_cost - cost[digit - 1]] + str(digit)`).

3. **Result Extraction**: 
    - After populating the DP table, the answer will be found in `dp[target]`. If it remains as `"-1"`, it means no valid number could be formed, so the answer would be "0".

### Python Code
Here's the complete code based on the above explanation:



```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, cost: List[int], target: int) -> str:
        # DP array to store the max number we can form with exactly `i` cost
        dp = ["-1"] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = ""  # Base case: Cost 0 means an empty number
        
        for current_cost in range(1, target + 1):
            for digit in range(1, 10):  # Digits from 1 to 9
                # Check if we can use this digit
                if current_cost - cost[digit - 1] >= 0:
                    # Form a new candidate number by adding the current digit
                    candidate_number = dp[current_cost - cost[digit - 1]] + str(digit)
                    # Update the DP table if candidate_number is larger
                    if dp[current_cost] == "-1" or len(candidate_number) > len(dp[current_cost]) or (len(candidate_number) == len(dp[current_cost]) and candidate_number > dp[current_cost]):
                        dp[current_cost] = candidate_number

        # The result resides in dp[target]
        return dp[target] if dp[target] != "-1" else "0"

```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define a class `Solution` and a method `largestNumber` which takes `cost` and `target` as inputs.
- The DP array is initialized, and we iterate through each potential current cost while checking every digit.
- The candidate number is updated in the dp table where necessary, ensuring that we are forming the maximum possible number.
- Finally, we return the result, ensuring the format required by LeetCode.

This solution should efficiently calculate the largest number that can be formed under the given constraints.

# 1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences

### Problem Description 
Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
Output: 18
Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.

Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.


Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]
Output: 21
Explanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2.

Their dot product is (3*7) = 21.


Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [-1,-1], nums2 = [1,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: Take subsequence [-1] from nums1 and subsequence [1] from nums2.

Their dot product is -1.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
`-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of two arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`), we can utilize dynamic programming. A dot product of two sequences is calculated by multiplying their corresponding elements and summing the results. To maximize the dot product when considering subsequences of equal lengths, we can establish a dynamic programming solution that examines all possible subsequences of various lengths.

### Approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum dot product of the subsequences formed using the first `i` elements of `nums1` and the first `j` elements of `nums2`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - Initialize `dp[0][j]` and `dp[i][0]` for all `i` and `j` to negative infinity (except for `dp[0][0]`, which will be 0), since we cannot select any subsequences when one of the lists is empty.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each pair of indices `i` and `j`, consider three cases:
     - Not including `nums1[i-1]` or `nums2[j-1]` in the subsequences, thus the value would be the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.
     - Including `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]`, we calculate the product of these two elements, and add it to `dp[i-1][j-1]` (which represents the best product of the previous elements).
   - The main decision to perform is comparing these computed values to fill `dp[i][j]`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The result will be found in `dp[len(nums1)][len(nums2)]`, which represents the maximum dot product for subsequences of the maximum lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.

### Python Code:
Here is the complete code implementing the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxDotProduct(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        
        # Initialize a dp array with negative infinity for all elements
        dp = [[float('-inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                # Calculate dot products
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1])
        
        # The final answer is in dp[m][n], which is the maximum dot product we can achieve
        return dp[m][n]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a nested loop to traverse each possible pair of subsequence lengths.
- For each combination, we calculate the maximum possible dot product using the three cases:
  1. Excluding the current element from `nums1`.
  2. Excluding the current element from `nums2`.
  3. Including the current elements from both.
- Finally, the result is found at `dp[m][n]`, which represents the maximum dot product of the complete subsequences formed by both arrays.

This approach effectively solves the problem within the constraints provided, and the overall time complexity is O(m * n), which is efficient given the problem's constraints.

# 1463. Cherry Pickup II

### Problem Description 
Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries. Each cell in `grid` represents the number of cherries that you can collect.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you, Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0,0) , and Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols-1) of the grid.

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots  by following the rules below:
From a cell (i,j), robots can move to cell (i+1, j-1) , (i+1, j) or (i+1, j+1).

When any robot is passing through a cell, It picks it up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell (0).

When both robots stay on the same cell, only one of them takes the cherries.

Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.

Both robots should reach the bottom row in the `grid`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.

Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.

Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.

Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.

Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.

Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.

Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,3],[0,0,0,3],[0,0,3,3],[9,0,3,3]]
Output: 22

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`rows == grid.length`
`cols == grid[i].length`
`2 <= rows, cols <= 70`
`0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100 `

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing cherry collection by two robots moving through a grid, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. Here is a solution that follows the structure and conventions typically found in LeetCode solutions.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a `rows x cols` grid where each cell contains cherries.
2. Robot #1 starts at (0,0) and Robot #2 starts at (0, cols-1).
3. Robots can move down to one of three cells in the next row (either diagonal left, straight down, or diagonal right).
4. The goal is to collect the maximum cherries possible while adhering to movement restrictions.

### Dynamic Programming Explanation:
- Let `dp[r][c1][c2]` be the maximum cherries collected when Robot #1 is at row `r` and column `c1`, while Robot #2 is at row `r` and column `c2`.
- To compute the DP values, we will consider the previous row's possible positions for both robots:
  - Robot #1 can move down from `c1-1`, `c1`, or `c1+1`.
  - Robot #2 can move down from `c2-1`, `c2`, or `c2+1`.
  
- We will iterate over each row and calculate the maximum cherries collected based on the possible positions in the previous row.

### Handling Picking Cherries:
If both robots occupy the same cell at the same time, we only add the cherries once.

### Final Computation:
The maximum cherries collected will be located at `dp[rows-1][c1][c2]` for all possible columns.

### Python Implementation:
Here's how you'd implement the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def cherryPickup(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # DP table to hold the maximum cherries that can be collected
        dp = [[[-float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
        
        # Initialize the first row
        dp[0][0][cols - 1] = grid[0][0] + grid[0][cols - 1]  # robots start here
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for r in range(1, rows):
            for c1 in range(cols):  # Robot 1's column
                for c2 in range(cols):  # Robot 2's column
                    # Only consider valid positions
                    max_cherries = -float('inf')
                    # Check all combinations of previous positions
                    for prev_c1 in (c1 - 1, c1, c1 + 1):
                        for prev_c2 in (c2 - 1, c2, c2 + 1):
                            if 0 <= prev_c1 < cols and 0 <= prev_c2 < cols:
                                max_cherries = max(max_cherries, dp[r - 1][prev_c1][prev_c2])
                    
                    # If robots are on the same cell, only pick cherries from it once
                    cherries = grid[r][c1] + (grid[r][c2] if c1 != c2 else 0)
                    dp[r][c1][c2] = max_cherries + cherries
        
        # The answer will be the maximum cherries collected on the last row
        max_result = 0
        for c1 in range(cols):
            for c2 in range(cols):
                max_result = max(max_result, dp[rows - 1][c1][c2])
        
        return max_result

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialize the DP Array**: We create a 3D array `dp` initialized to negative infinity to represent that positions start invalid until calculated.
2. **Base Case Handling**: The first row gets initialized considering both robots start collecting cherries.
3. **DP Filling**: Iterate through each row and compute the maximum cherries that can be collected for each combination of positions in the current row.
4. **Output the Result**: Finally, compute the maximum cherries collected from the last row.

This algorithm runs in \(O(rows \times cols^2)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

# 1473. Paint House III

### Problem Description 
There is a row of `m` houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the `n` colors (labeled from `1` to `n`), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.

A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

For example: `houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1]` contains `5` neighborhoods `[{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}]`.

Given an array `houses`, an `m x n` matrix `cost` and an integer `target` where:
`houses[i]`: is the color of the house `i`, and `0` if the house is not painted yet.

`cost[i][j]`: is the cost of paint the house `i` with the color `j + 1`.

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly `target` neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}].

Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.


Example 2:
Input: houses = [0,2,1,2,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
Output: 11
Explanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way [2,2,1,2,2]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. 
Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.


Example 3:
Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[1,10],[10,1],[1,10]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 5
Output: 5

Example 4:
Input: houses = [3,1,2,3], cost = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], m = 4, n = 3, target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.


Constraints:
`m == houses.length == cost.length`
`n == cost[i].length`
`1 <= m <= 100`
`1 <= n <= 20`
`1 <= target <= m`
`0 <= houses[i] <= n`
`1 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^4`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of painting the houses while meeting the requirements for neighborhoods and minimizing costs, we can utilize dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the minimum painting costs as we process each house in sequence, building our solution progressively.

Here's how we will approach the problem:

### Key Concepts
1. **Dynamic Programming State**: We will maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses, with `j` neighborhoods and having the last painted house as color `k`.
2. **House Initialization**: If a house is already painted, we need to take that into account by determining whether to continue the neighborhood with that color or start a new one.
3. **Transition between States**: For each unpainted house, we'll calculate the cost for each color and update our DP states based on the previous states.

### Steps
1. **Initialize the DP Table**: Set up a 3D list for the DP table, where all values initially are set to infinity (or a large number) except for the base case (0 houses painted).
2. **Iterate through Houses**: For each house, either keep the current color if painted or consider using each color if unpainted, updating the neighborhoods accordingly.
3. **Final Calculation**: Evaluate the DP states for the last house to find the minimum cost with exactly `target` neighborhoods.

### Python Code
Here's the implementation of the above approach, structured appropriately to run in a LeetCode environment.



```python
def minCost(houses, cost, m, n, target):
    # Initialize a 3D DP array with large numbers
    inf = float('inf')
    dp = [[[inf] * (n + 1) for _ in range(target + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Base case: no houses painted, zero neighborhoods costs 0
    dp[0][0][0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            for k in range(1, n + 1):
                if houses[i - 1] == 0:  # House is unpainted
                    # Attempt to paint the i-th house with color k
                    # Check previously painted houses/neighborhoods
                    for prev_color in range(1, n + 1):
                        # If painting this house to 'k' and if last house was 'prev_color'
                        if k == prev_color:
                            dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j][k] + cost[i - 1][k - 1])
                        else:
                            dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j - 1][prev_color] + cost[i - 1][k - 1])
                else:  # House is already painted
                    # Here, we just need to check if the painted house's color is k
                    if k == houses[i - 1]:
                        # Link it to the previous house
                        dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j][k])
                    # Additionally, handle adding a new neighborhood
                    for prev_color in range(1, n + 1):
                        if prev_color != k:
                            dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j - 1][prev_color])
    
    # The answer would be the minimum cost to paint the m-th house with exactly target neighborhoods
    result = min(dp[m][target][k] for k in range(1, n + 1))
    
    return result if result < inf else -1

```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: We initialize the DP table with `inf` to signify unachievable states.
- **Iterating through houses**: For each house, we determine the minimum cost of painting it either with a cost from the `cost` matrix or retaining its original color.
- **Final result extraction**: After processing all houses, the minimum value from the last layer of the DP table represents the lowest cost to achieve exactly `target` neighborhoods.

This code should work efficiently within the constraints given, ensuring that it covers all possible configurations of houses and neighborhoods while adhering to the painting costs.

# 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of `arr` each with sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.


Example 4:
Input: arr = [5,5,4,4,5], target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot find a sub-array of sum = 3.


Example 5:
Input: arr = [3,1,1,1,5,1,2,1], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Note that sub-arrays [1,2] and [2,1] cannot be an answer because they overlap.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
`1 <= target <= 10^8`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of lengths of two non-overlapping sub-arrays where each sub-array has a sum equal to a given `target`, we can utilize an efficient approach based on prefix sums and a hash map for storing the length of found sub-arrays. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach and the corresponding code:

### Approach

1. **Identify Sub-arrays**: First, we need a method to identify all sub-arrays that sum up to the `target`. We can do this by using a prefix sum method combined with a hash map. As we traverse the array, we can maintain a running sum and check if the previous sums (by using the hash map) can yield the `target`.

2. **Store Lengths**: As we identify valid sub-arrays, we compute their lengths and store them in a list of tuples (length, start_index, end_index).

3. **Calculate Minimum Length**: Once we have all valid sub-array candidates, we can check each pair of found sub-arrays to ensure they do not overlap, and calculate the minimum sum of their lengths.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, if we have found valid pairs of non-overlapping sub-arrays, we return the minimum length. If no such pairs exist, we return -1.

Here is the complete code following this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def minSumOfLengths(self, arr: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        min_length = [float('inf')] * n  # To store minimum lengths of valid sub-arrays
        prefix_sum = 0
        sum_indices = {0: -1}  # To store prefix sums and their last index

        # Find all sub-arrays which sum to target
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += arr[i]

            # Check if the required prefix exists
            if (prefix_sum - target) in sum_indices:
                start_index = sum_indices[prefix_sum - target] + 1
                length = i - start_index + 1
                # Store the length of the valid sub-array
                min_length[i] = length
            
            # Update the hash map to include the current prefix sum with its index
            sum_indices[prefix_sum] = i

        # Now calculate prefix min lengths
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_length[i] = min(min_length[i], min_length[i - 1])

        answer = float('inf')

        # Check the possible pairs of non-overlapping sub-arrays
        for i in range(n):
            if min_length[i] != float('inf'):  # If there's a valid sub-array ending before or at i
                # We can add it with a previous sub-array
                if i > 0:  # There is a sub-array before i
                    length_before_i = min_length[i - 1]
                    if length_before_i != float('inf'):
                        answer = min(answer, length_before_i + min_length[i])

        return answer if answer != float('inf') else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `min_length` to store the lengths of valid sub-arrays, setting them to infinity initially, along with a prefix sum and a hash map `sum_indices` to track the last index where each prefix sum is seen.

2. **Finding Sub-arrays**: We loop through the array to update the prefix sum and check if the difference `(prefix_sum - target)` exists in the hash map. If it does, a valid sub-array exists, and we calculate its length and store it.

3. **Calculating Minimum Prefix Lengths**: We iterate through the `min_length` to retain the minimum valid lengths at each position.

4. **Finding Non-overlapping Pairs**: Finally, we check for valid pairs of sub-arrays (using earlier lengths stored) ensuring they do not overlap. The answer is computed by adding their lengths together.

5. **Final Result**: If we find a valid answer, we return it; otherwise, we return -1.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Each element of arr is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case due to the storage of lengths and prefix sums.

This implementation efficiently solves the problem while adhering to the constraints provided.

# 1478. Allocate Mailboxes

### Problem Description 
Given the array `houses` and an integer `k`. where `houses[i]` is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate `k` mailboxes in the street.

Return the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.


Example 1:
Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.

Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 

Example 2:
Input: houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.

Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.


Example 3:
Input: houses = [7,4,6,1], k = 1
Output: 8

Example 4:
Input: houses = [3,6,14,10], k = 4
Output: 0

Constraints:
`n == houses.length`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= houses[i] <= 10^4`
`1 <= k <= n`
Array `houses` contain unique integers.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum total distance between houses and their nearest mailboxes, we can utilize dynamic programming and clever partitioning of the houses based on the locations of the mailboxes. The challenge is to allocate `k` mailboxes while minimizing the total distance.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Sorting**: First, we sort the `houses` array. This allows us to calculate ranges more easily since houses will be located in a linear format after sorting.

2. **Distance Calculation**: We create a helper function to calculate the sum of distances for a given segment of houses to be served by a single mailbox. The optimal place for a mailbox to minimize the distance to all houses in a segment is at the median of the segment.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
   - `i` represents the first `i` houses.
   - `j` represents the number of mailboxes allocated.
   The value `dp[i][j]` will then represent the minimum total distance for the first `i` houses using `j` mailboxes.

4. **State Transition**:
   - We calculate the minimum distance for varying numbers of mailboxes and use previously computed results to build up the answer. Specifically, to find `dp[i][j]`, we will consider all possible placements of the `j`-th mailbox in the houses segment, calculating the optimal distance for each configuration.

5. **Result**: The answer will be found at `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the total number of houses, and `k` is the desired number of mailboxes.

### Python Code

Below is the Python implementation of the above logic, structured so that it is compatible with the LeetCode platform:



```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, houses: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        houses.sort()
        n = len(houses)
        
        # distance[i][j]: min distance for houses[i:j]
        distance = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Precompute distances
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                median = houses[(i + j) // 2]
                distance[i][j] = sum(abs(houses[m] - median) for m in range(i, j + 1))
        
        # dp[i][j]: min distance for the first i houses with j mailboxes
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0  # base case: 0 houses with 0 mailboxes
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                for m in range(i):  # possible last mailbox position
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[m][j - 1] + distance[m][i - 1])

        return dp[n][k]

```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the above code is `O(n^3)`. The nested loops in the `dp` computation lead to this complexity:
  - Outer loops for houses (`i` and `j`): `O(n^2)`
  - Innermost loop for possible last mailbox placements: `O(n)`

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n^2)` for the DP table and distance precomputation.

This method is efficient given the problem constraints, where `n` can be at most 100.

# 1483. Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node

### Problem Description 
You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. The root of the tree is node `0`.

Implement the function `getKthAncestor``(int node, int k)` to return the `k`-th ancestor of the given `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

The k-th ancestor of a tree node is the `k`-th node in the path from that node to the root.


Example:
Input:
["TreeAncestor","getKthAncestor","getKthAncestor","getKthAncestor"]
[[7,[-1,0,0,1,1,2,2]],[3,1],[5,2],[6,3]]
Output:
[null,1,0,-1]
Explanation:
TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1);  // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2);  // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3);  // returns -1 because there is no such ancestor

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= n <= 5*10^4`
`parent[0] == -1` indicating that `0` is the root node.

`0 <= parent[i] < n` for all `0 < i < n`
`0 <= node < n`
There will be at most `5*10^4` queries.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the k-th ancestor of a tree node represented by a parent array, we can take advantage of binary lifting, which allows us to efficiently find ancestors in logarithmic time.

### Understanding the Problem
Given a tree in the form of a parent array:
- `parent[i]` gives the parent of node `i`.
- The root node is indicated by `parent[0]` being `-1`.

We need to answer multiple queries asking for the k-th ancestor of a specific node.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   We will use a data structure to store the ancestors of each node. Specifically, we will use a 2D list that allows us to store ancestors at different "levels" for each node. This will enable us to jump back several levels at once during our queries.

2. **Filling the Ancestor Table**: 
   We initialize a 2D list `ancestors` where `ancestors[node][j]` will store the 2^j-th ancestor of `node`. We will fill this table using dynamic programming principles:
   - For each node i, the direct parent can be found using the `parent` array.
   - For higher levels, i.e., if we want to jump back 2^j levels, we can do this by jumping from `ancestors[i][j-1]` to its 2^j-th ancestor.

3. **Processing Queries**: 
   When we want to find the k-th ancestor of a node, we can decompose k into binary form and use the precomputed ancestors to jump back in powers of two, allowing us to find the k-th ancestor quickly.

### Implementation

Here is the Python implementation based on the above plan:



```python
class TreeAncestor:

    def __init__(self, n: int, parent: List[int]):
        self.max_power = n.bit_length()  # This gives us log base 2 of n
        self.ancestors = [[-1] * self.max_power for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Fill the first column of ancestors with direct parents
        for node in range(n):
            self.ancestors[node][0] = parent[node]
        
        # Fill the ancestor table
        for j in range(1, self.max_power):
            for i in range(n):
                if self.ancestors[i][j-1] != -1:
                    self.ancestors[i][j] = self.ancestors[self.ancestors[i][j-1]][j-1]

    def getKthAncestor(self, node: int, k: int) -> int:
        while k > 0 and node != -1:
            # For each bit in k, we take the corresponding ancestor
            power = k.bit_length() - 1  # Get the largest power of 2 ≤ k
            node = self.ancestors[node][power]  # Jump to the 2^power ancestor
            k -= (1 << power)  # Decrease k by the power of 2 we just jumped
        return node

```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: We prepare the `ancestors` table with dimensions `[n][max_power]` where `max_power` is `log2(n)`. We populate the first column with the direct parents from the `parent` array and fill the rest of the table using the relationships defined.
  
- **Query (`getKthAncestor`)**: For a given node and k:
  - We iteratively check if k is greater than 0 and node is valid.
  - We find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k (`k.bit_length() - 1`).
  - We then update the node to its ancestor at that power and reduce k.
  
In this way, we efficiently return the k-th ancestor if it exists or `-1` otherwise.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Space Complexity**: O(n log n) for the ancestors table.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log k) for each query, leading to very efficient handling of multiple queries.

# 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones

### Problem Description 
Given a `rows * columns` matrix `mat` of ones and zeros, return how many submatrices have all ones.


Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,0,1],
              [1,1,0],
              [1,1,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation:
There are 6 rectangles of side 1x1.

There are 2 rectangles of side 1x2.

There are 3 rectangles of side 2x1.

There is 1 rectangle of side 2x2. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x1.

Total number of rectangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.


Example 2:
Input: mat = [[0,1,1,0],
              [0,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
There are 8 rectangles of side 1x1.

There are 5 rectangles of side 1x2.

There are 2 rectangles of side 1x3. 
There are 4 rectangles of side 2x1.

There are 2 rectangles of side 2x2. 
There are 2 rectangles of side 3x1. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x2. 
Total number of rectangles = 8 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 24.


Example 3:
Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 21

Example 4:
Input: mat = [[1,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= rows <= 150`
`1 <= columns <= 150`
`0 <= mat[i][j] <= 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of submatrices filled with all ones in a binary matrix, we can approach it systematically using dynamic programming. The concept revolves around using a histogram approach where we count the number of continuous '1's ending at each position in the matrix. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
    - We need to find all contiguous submatrices that consist entirely of 1s.
    - A submatrix is defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - For each cell in the matrix, if it contains a `1`, we count how many continuous 1s are vertically aligned (in a column) and build a histogram.
    - For each cell (i, j) in the matrix, we will maintain a `height` array, where `height[j]` will track the number of consecutive 1s ending at row i in column j.
    - Using the `height` array, for each row, we'll determine how many submatrices can be formed using this height.

3. **Counting Submatrices**:
    - For each `height[j]`, we can determine how many rectangles can be formed using that particular height as the minimum height for a rectangle extending up from the current row.

Let's see how to implement this in Python code in a LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def numSubmat(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not mat:
            return 0

        rows = len(mat)
        cols = len(mat[0])
        
        # This array will keep track of the heights of the histogram
        height = [0] * cols
        total_submatrices = 0

        # Loop through each row
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                # Calculate the height for the histogram
                if mat[i][j] == 1:
                    height[j] += 1
                else:
                    height[j] = 0
                
            # Now we calculate the number of submatrices for this row's histogram
            total_submatrices += self.countSubmatrices(height)
        
        return total_submatrices
    
    def countSubmatrices(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        # This stores how many heights are considered for the rectangle
        stack = []
        
        # Append a zero height to facilitate handling the remaining heights
        for i in range(len(height)):
            while stack and height[stack[-1]] > height[i]:
                h = height[stack.pop()]
                # Width is current index i minus the index of the last smaller height which is now popped
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                count += h * width
            
            stack.append(i)
        
        # To handle the remaining entries in the stack
        while stack:
            h = height[stack.pop()]
            width = len(height) if not stack else len(height) - stack[-1] - 1
            count += h * width
        
        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Declaration**: We define a class `Solution` as per LeetCode conventions.
2. **Method Definition**: The `numSubmat` method takes a 2D list `mat` as input, representing the matrix.
3. **Initialization**: We initialize:
    - `rows` and `cols` for the dimensions of `mat`.
    - `height`, an array to track continuous heights of `1`s.
    - `total_submatrices` to hold the total count of 1-filled submatrices.
4. **Main Iteration**: We iterate over each cell in the matrix:
    - Update the `height` array based on whether the current element is a `1` or `0`.
5. **Submatrix Counting**: After updating heights for the current row, we call a helper function `countSubmatrices` which:
    - Uses a stack to keep track of indexes of height in a monotonically increasing way to calculate the potential width of submatrices based on the heights.
6. **Final Return**: Finally, we return the `total_submatrices` which counts all valid submatrices filled with 1s.

The runtime complexity is `O(rows * columns)`, as we traverse the matrix and manage stack operations efficiently to count submatrices. This solution is efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints given in the problem.

# 1510. Stone Game IV

### Problem Description 
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).


Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).


Example 4:
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.

If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).


Example 5:
Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether Alice wins the game given a pile of stones, we can utilize dynamic programming based on the game's rules. The essential insight is that we need to keep track of game states and the winning strategies for each player.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Game Rules Recap**: Alice and Bob take turns removing square numbers of stones (1, 4, 9, etc.) from the pile. If a player cannot make a move, they lose.

2. **Understanding Winning Positions**:
   - A position (number of stones) is a **winning position** for the current player if they can force a win regardless of how the opponent plays.
   - Conversely, a position is a **losing position** if any possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **State Definition**: Let `dp[i]` be a boolean value indicating whether the player whose turn it is with `i` stones can win. 
   - `dp[i] = True` means the player can win with `i` stones.
   - `dp[i] = False` means the player cannot win (that is, there exists a move that leads to a losing position for them).

2. **Base Case**: 
   - When there are `0` stones, the player loses: `dp[0] = False`.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each number of stones `i` from `1` to `n`, we check all possible square numbers `j*j` such that `j*j <= i`.
   - If for any square number removed (`i - j*j`), the resultant position is a losing position for the opponent (`dp[i - j*j] == False`), then `dp[i]` should be `True`.

4. **Implementation**: We employ a loop to fill our `dp` table and finally return `dp[n]`.

Here's the implementation of this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def winnerSquareGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)  # Create a list of size n + 1, initialized to False
        
        # Fill the dp array
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            j = 1  # Start checking square numbers from 1^2
            while j * j <= i:  # ensure we're within bounds
                if not dp[i - j * j]:  # If the opponent's position is losing
                    dp[i] = True  # Current position is winning
                    break
                j += 1  # Check for the next square number
        
        return dp[n]  # The result for n stones is stored in dp[n]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initiate an array `dp` of size `n+1`, where all positions are initially set to `False` because we assume the worst case (losing position) at first.
- We loop through each possible number of stones (`i`) from `1` to `n`. For each `i`, we check all square numbers that could be removed (using `j*j`).
- If we find any square number such that removing it leads to a losing position for the opponent, we set `dp[i]` to `True`.
- Finally, the value `dp[n]` gives us the answer - whether Alice can win with `n` stones given optimal plays from both sides.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * sqrt(n)) because for each `i`, we may check up to `sqrt(i)`, leading to a nested loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `dp` array.

This solution runs efficiently within the provided constraints and captures the necessary logic to determine the outcome of the game optimally.

# 1531. String Compression II

### Problem Description 
Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `"aabccc"` we replace `"aa"` by `"a2"` and replace `"ccc"` by `"c3"`. Thus the compressed string becomes `"a2bc3"`.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete at most `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of `s` after deleting at most `k` characters.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aaabcccd", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us "a3bc3d" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = "abcccd" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be "a3c3" of length 4.


Example 2:
Input: s = "aabbaa", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be "a4" of length 2.


Example 3:
Input: s = "aaaaaaaaaaa", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is "a11" of length 3.


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 100`
`0 <= k <= s.length`
`s` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to compress a given string using run-length encoding while allowing for at most `k` deletions to minimize the length of the compressed string. Let's break down the steps and format the solution as per LeetCode requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Run-Length Encoding**: This method condenses consecutive identical characters into a single character followed by the count of its occurrences.
2. **Deletions Impact**: We can delete characters to reduce counts of consecutive groups before run-length encoding, directly affecting the final compressed length.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We'll use dynamic programming to evaluate the minimum length of the compressed string for each group of characters while considering the allowable deletions.

### Steps:
1. **Count Consecutive Characters**: First, we'd need to group the consecutive characters and their counts. 
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Using a list to keep track of the minimum possible lengths after processing each group of characters based on deletions allowed.
   
- If we have a sequence of `x` same characters (like `"aaa"`), deleting `y` characters (`y <= x`) will affect the final count:
  - If we delete `y`, the new count becomes `new_count = max(0, x - y)`. 
- We can update our DP array based on how the sequence count changes when deleting characters.

### Implementation:

Here is the solution formatted for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def getLengthOfOptimalCompression(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create groups of counts of each character
        groups = []
        count = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                groups.append(count)
                count = 1
        
        # Don't forget to add the last group
        groups.append(count)

        # Step 2: Initialize DP array
        n = len(groups)
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0  # No groups and 0 deletions means 0 length

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(k + 1):
                # Option 1: Do not delete, simply add the current group's contribution
                current_length = dp[i - 1][j] + self.calculateLength(groups[i - 1])
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], current_length)

                # Option 2: Try deleting from the current group
                for del_count in range(min(groups[i - 1], j) + 1):
                    remaining_count = groups[i - 1] - del_count
                    if remaining_count > 0:
                        current_length = dp[i - 1][j - del_count] + self.calculateLength(remaining_count)
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], current_length)
                    else:
                        current_length = dp[i - 1][j - del_count]  # when remaining count is 0, it contributes nothing
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], current_length)

        return dp[n][k]
    
    def calculateLength(self, count: int) -> int:
        if count == 1:
            return 1  # "a" is represented as "a"
        elif count < 10:
            return 2  # "aa" becomes "a2"
        elif count < 100:
            return 3  # "aaa" becomes "a3", "aa" could also become "a2"
        else:
            return 4  # counts >= 100 will fit into "aN" where N can be at most 3 digits

```

### Explanation:
- **Grouping Count Calculation**: We first transform the input string into groups of consecutive identical characters, storing the count of each group.
- **DP Setup**: We prepare a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` holds the minimal length of compressed string using the first `i` groups with `j` deletions allowed.
- **Transitions**:
  - We compute the length including the current group without deletions and attempting deletions while updating our current state in the DP array.
- The helper function `calculateLength` determines the contribution of a count to the length of the compressed string based on run-length encoding rules.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k) where `n` is the number of character groups and `k` is the number of deletions allowed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k) for the DP table.

This implementation is efficient and ready to run on LeetCode with the given constraints.

# 1537. Get the Maximum Score

### Problem Description 
You are given two sorted arrays of distinct integers `nums1` and `nums2.`
A valid path is defined as follows:
Choose array nums1 or nums2 to traverse (from index-0).

Traverse the current array from left to right.

If you are reading any value that is present in `nums1` and `nums2` you are allowed to change your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is considered in the valid path).

Score is defined as the sum of uniques values in a valid path.

Return the maximum score you can obtain of all possible valid paths.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,4,5,8,10], nums2 = [4,6,8,9]
Output: 30
Explanation: Valid paths:
[2,4,5,8,10], [2,4,5,8,9], [2,4,6,8,9], [2,4,6,8,10],  (starting from nums1)
[4,6,8,9], [4,5,8,10], [4,5,8,9], [4,6,8,10]    (starting from nums2)
The maximum is obtained with the path in green [2,4,6,8,10].


Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,3,5,7,9], nums2 = [3,5,100]
Output: 109
Explanation: Maximum sum is obtained with the path [1,3,5,100].


Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [6,7,8,9,10]
Output: 40
Explanation: There are no common elements between nums1 and nums2.

Maximum sum is obtained with the path [6,7,8,9,10].


Example 4:
Input: nums1 = [1,4,5,8,9,11,19], nums2 = [2,3,4,11,12]
Output: 61

Constraints:
`1 <= nums1.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums2.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^7`
`nums1` and `nums2` are strictly increasing.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum score of valid paths through two sorted arrays of distinct integers, we can utilize a two-pointer technique in conjunction with a greedy algorithm. The key idea is to traverse both arrays and keep track of the current sum of unique values while switching between the arrays whenever we encounter common elements.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the algorithm and its implementation as per the LeetCode solution format:

### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. **Initial Setup**: We'll define two pointers that will traverse `nums1` and `nums2`. We'll also maintain a variable for the current score from both paths and a variable to keep track of the last added sum before switching paths at the common elements.

2. **Iterate through Arrays**: Using a while loop, we will traverse both arrays:
   - If the current elements of both arrays are equal, we have encountered a common element. At this point, we need to decide whether to continue in the current array or switch to the other one. We can deduce that switching will typically let us maximize our score because we can include the summed values from both paths up to the common element.
   - If one element is smaller, we will add it to the current path's score and move the pointer forward in the corresponding array.

3. **Calculate Scores**: For each common element found:
   - Before switching paths, we will update our score with the sum of the unique values collected from the current path.
   - We then switch paths and begin collecting values from the alternate array.

4. **Final Calculation**: After the while loop, we will need to capture any remaining values from the last path we were on, as we might still have valid scores left to add.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the maximum score modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Implementation in Python:



```python
def maxScore(nums1, nums2):
    MODULO = 10**9 + 7
    
    i, j = 0, 0
    score1, score2 = 0, 0
    result = 0
    
    while i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
        if nums1[i] < nums2[j]:
            score1 += nums1[i]
            i += 1
        elif nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            score2 += nums2[j]
            j += 1
        else:
            # If we have a common element
            result = max(result, score1 + score2 + nums1[i])  # Current common element
            # Switch to the other array, complete scores
            score1, score2 = score2 + nums1[i], 0
            i += 1
            j += 1
            
    # Collect remaining parts of both arrays if no more common elements
    while i < len(nums1):
        score1 += nums1[i]
        i += 1
        
    while j < len(nums2):
        score2 += nums2[j]
        j += 1
        
    # Final comparison after exiting the loop
    result = max(result, score1 + score2)
    
    return result % MODULO

# Example usage:
print(maxScore([2, 4, 5, 8, 10], [4, 6, 8, 9]))  # Output: 30
print(maxScore([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [3, 5, 100]))    # Output: 109
print(maxScore([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))  # Output: 40
print(maxScore([1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 19], [2, 3, 4, 11, 12]))  # Output: 61

```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N + M)\) where \(N\) is the length of `nums1` and \(M\) is the length of `nums2`. Each element in both arrays is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

This algorithm effectively handles the problem within the constraints and optimally calculates the maximum score through an effective traversal of both arrays.

# 1546. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return the maximum number of non-empty non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of values in each subarray is equal to `target`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 non-overlapping subarrays [1,1,1,1,1] with sum equals to target(2).


Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,3,5,1,4,2,-9], target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 subarrays with sum equal to 6.

([5,1], [4,2], [3,5,1,4,2,-9]) but only the first 2 are non-overlapping.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [-2,6,6,3,5,4,1,2,8], target = 10
Output: 3

Example 4:
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 0
Output: 3

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
`0 <= target <= 10^6`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-empty non-overlapping subarrays whose sum equals a given target, we can use a hashmap (dictionary in Python) to keep track of cumulative sums and their occurrences. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Cumulative Sum**: We will maintain a cumulative sum as we iterate through the array. This will help us efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.

2. **HashMap for Counting**: We create a hashmap to store the frequency of cumulative sums we've seen so far. The key will be the cumulative sum, and the value will be its index. This hashmap will help us determine if a previous cumulative sum (that could lead to our target) has been seen.

3. **Non-Overlapping Condition**: We also need to ensure that subarrays do not overlap. To do this, once we find a valid subarray that sums to the target, we will reset our cumulative sum and clear the hashmap.

4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Each time we identify a valid subarray (where the sum equals the target), we increment our count.

Here’s the Python code implementing the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxNonOverlapping(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # To keep track of the number of non-overlapping subarrays
        count = 0
        # Cumulative sum to help find if a subarray exists
        cumulative_sum = 0
        # Set to track seen cumulative sums
        seen_sums = {0}  # We add 0 to handle the case when subarray starts from index 0
        # Temporary set to track cumulative sums in the current scope
        current_sums = set()
        
        for num in nums:
            # Update the cumulative sum
            cumulative_sum += num
            
            # Check if the current cumulative sum minus target has been seen
            if (cumulative_sum - target) in current_sums:
                count += 1  # We found a valid subarray
                # Reset the cumulative_sum and current_sums for non-overlapping
                cumulative_sum = 0
                current_sums.clear()  # Clear the current sums to start fresh
                current_sums.add(0)   # Add zero again for a new start
            else:
                # Add the cumulative sum to the set of current sums
                current_sums.add(cumulative_sum)
        
        return count

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:

- **Initialization**: We initialize `count`, `cumulative_sum`, and sets to track sums.
  
- **Iterate Over `nums`**: For each number in `nums`, we:
  - Update the `cumulative_sum` by adding the current number.
  - Check if `cumulative_sum - target` exists in `current_sums`. If it does, this means we found a subarray that sums to `target`.
    - Increment the count of valid subarrays.
    - Reset `cumulative_sum` and `current_sums` to ensure no overlaps in future subarrays.
  - If we haven't found a valid subarray, we add the `cumulative_sum` to `current_sums`.

- **Return the Count**: After iterating through all numbers, we return the count of valid subarrays.

### Edge Cases:
- When the input array consists of zeros and the target is zero, this code can correctly identify multiple subarrays of zeros.

By following this method, we ensure that we achieve a solution efficiently, as we're essentially traversing the `nums` array only once, leading to a time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case due to the storage of cumulative sums in the hashmap.

# 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick

### Problem Description 
Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:
Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.

Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).


Example 2:
Input: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]
Output: 22
Explanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.

There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.


Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 10^6`
`1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
`1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
All the integers in `cuts` array are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of cutting a stick marked from `0` to `n`, we can break down the problem and use a dynamic programming approach. The key points to consider are:

1. **Understanding the Cuts**: Each time we cut the stick at a position, the cost incurred is the length of the stick being cut. Therefore, the order in which the cuts are made significantly affects the total cost.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to cut the stick segment starting at the `i-th` cut and ending at the `j-th` cut. Here, the `cuts` array needs to be managed with two additional "virtual" cuts at positions `0` and `n` to represent the ends of the stick.

3. **Formulate the Recurrence Relation**: For every segment between two cuts, we can try making each possible cut within that segment and compute the total cost incurred if we made that cut. We then combine the costs of the left and right segments with the cost of the current cut.

4. **Implementation Details**: 
   - We will sort the `cuts` array and add `0` and `n` to it to handle the complete range.
   - We will fill the DP table with the minimum costs iteratively.
   - The base case for segments of length 1 (where no cuts can be made) will initialize to `0`.

Let’s implement this in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, n: int, cuts: List[int]) -> int:
        # Adding 0 and n to cuts
        cuts = [0] + sorted(cuts) + [n]
        m = len(cuts)
        
        # dp[i][j] will represent the minimum cost to cut between cuts[i] and cuts[j]
        dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(m)]
        
        # We fill the DP table for lengths from 2 to m - 1 (i.e., gaps between cuts)
        for length in range(2, m):   # length is the number of cuts we are considering
            for i in range(m - length):  # i is the starting cut
                j = i + length  # j is the ending cut
                # We want to minimize the cost between cuts[i] and cuts[j]
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')  # Start with a large number
                for k in range(i + 1, j):  # k is the cut we will make in between
                    cost = cuts[j] - cuts[i]  # Cost of the cut we are making
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cost)
        
        # The answer is the minimum cost to cut between the first and last cut
        return dp[0][m - 1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: We take the input `n` (length of the stick) and `cuts` (positions to cut). We augment the `cuts` with `0` and `n` representing boundaries.

2. **DP Table Initialization**: We create a 2D list `dp` initialized to zero, where `dp[i][j]` captures the minimum costs associated with the cuts between `cuts[i]` and `cuts[j]`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate over all possible segment lengths (from 2 to `m-1`) and for each segment defined by `cuts[i]` and `cuts[j]`, we iterate through possible cuts `k` and compute the cost. We derive the minimum possible cost for each segment.

4. **Return Statement**: The final result is found in `dp[0][m-1]`, which gives the minimum total cost of performing all cuts in the optimal order.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(m^3)\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts (maximum of 102 for this problem because cuts can be at most \(n-1\)).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m^2)\) for the DP table.

This solution effectively allows us to minimize the cost of cutting the stick by smartly analyzing all possible cutting sequences through dynamic programming.

# 1548. The Most Similar Path in a Graph

### Problem Description 
We have `n` cities and `m` bi-directional `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` connects city `ai` with city `bi`. Each city has a name consisting of exactly 3 upper-case English letters given in the string array `names`. Starting at any city `x`, you can reach any city `y` where `y != x` (i.e. the cities and the roads are forming an undirected connected graph).

You will be given a string array `targetPath`. You should find a path in the graph of the same length and with the minimum edit distance to `targetPath`.

You need to return the order of the nodes in the path with the minimum edit distance, The path should be of the same length of `targetPath` and should be valid (i.e. there should be a direct road between `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]`). If there are multiple answers return any one of them.

The edit distance is defined as follows:
Follow-up: If each node can be visited only once in the path, What should you change in your solution?

Example 1:
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,4]], names = ["ATL","PEK","LAX","DXB","HND"], targetPath = ["ATL","DXB","HND","LAX"]
Output: [0,2,4,2]
Explanation: [0,2,4,2], [0,3,0,2] and [0,3,1,2] are accepted answers.

[0,2,4,2] is equivalent to ["ATL","LAX","HND","LAX"] which has edit distance = 1 with targetPath.

[0,3,0,2] is equivalent to ["ATL","DXB","ATL","LAX"] which has edit distance = 1 with targetPath.

[0,3,1,2] is equivalent to ["ATL","DXB","PEK","LAX"] which has edit distance = 1 with targetPath.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,2]], names = ["ATL","PEK","LAX","DXB"], targetPath = ["ABC","DEF","GHI","JKL","MNO","PQR","STU","VWX"]
Output: [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Explanation: Any path in this graph has edit distance = 8 with targetPath.


Example 3:
Input: n = 6, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], names = ["ATL","PEK","LAX","ATL","DXB","HND"], targetPath = ["ATL","DXB","HND","DXB","ATL","LAX","PEK"]
Output: [3,4,5,4,3,2,1]
Explanation: [3,4,5,4,3,2,1] is the only path with edit distance = 0 with targetPath.

It's equivalent to ["ATL","DXB","HND","DXB","ATL","LAX","PEK"]

Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 100`
`m == roads.length`
`n - 1 <= m <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
`0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
`ai != bi `
The graph is guaranteed to be connected and each pair of nodes may have at most one direct road.

`names.length == n`
`names[i].length == 3`
`names[i]` consists of upper-case English letters.

There can be two cities with the same name.

`1 <= targetPath.length <= 100`
`targetPath[i].length == 3`
`targetPath[i]` consists of upper-case English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding a path in a graph with the same length as `targetPath` that has the minimum edit distance to that target path, we can use a combination of breadth-first search (BFS) for exploring paths through the graph and dynamic programming for calculating the minimum edit distances.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Graph Representation:**
   We will represent the graph using an adjacency list, where each city has a list of its directly connected neighboring cities.

2. **Edit Distance Function:**
   We need a function to calculate the edit distance between a city name and the corresponding name in `targetPath`.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   Implement BFS to explore all possible paths in the graph of the same length as `targetPath`. As we proceed, we will track the minimum edit distance at each step.

4. **Path Reconstruction:**
   Keep track of the cities visited in each valid path to reconstruct the path with the minimum edit distance at the end.

5. **Final Conditions:**
   Ensure that each city is visited only once along a path.

### Implementation

The following code implements the above strategy in Python, formatted for LeetCode.



```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def min_edit_distance(word1, word2):
    # Simple edit distance function
    return sum(el1 != el2 for el1, el2 in zip(word1, word2))

class Solution:
    def mostSimilar(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]], names: List[str], targetPath: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        # Create the graph using an adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in roads:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)

        # Initialize DP table
        m = len(targetPath)
        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
        parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]

        # Base case
        for city in range(n):
            dp[0][city] = min_edit_distance(names[city], targetPath[0])

        # Fill DP table
        for i in range(1, m):
            for city in range(n):
                for neighbor in graph[city]:
                    cost = dp[i - 1][neighbor] + min_edit_distance(names[city], targetPath[i])
                    if cost < dp[i][city]:
                        dp[i][city] = cost
                        parent[i][city] = neighbor

        # Reconstruct the path
        min_cost = float('inf')
        last_city = -1
        for city in range(n):
            if dp[m - 1][city] < min_cost:
                min_cost = dp[m - 1][city]
                last_city = city

        # Now backtrack to find the full path
        path = []
        for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
            path.append(last_city)
            last_city = parent[i][last_city]

        return path[::-1]  # Reverse path


```

### Explanation

- **Graph Construction:** The graph is constructed using a defaultdict to map each city to its directly connected cities.
  
- **Dynamic Programming Table:** `dp[i][j]` holds the minimum edit distance to match the first `i` cities of `targetPath` ending at city `j`. The `parent` table helps trace back the path.

- **Base Case:** For the first city in `targetPath`, we compute how many edits are necessary for each city name.

- **Transition:** For each subsequent city in `targetPath`, we look for the minimum edit distance using its neighbors. The edit distance from the previous city to the current one (in `targetPath`) is calculated and updated.

- **Backtracking:** After filling the DP table, we find the last city in the optimal path, and backtrack using the `parent` table to reconstruct the full path taken.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot n^2)\) where \(m\) is the length of the `targetPath` and \(n\) is the number of cities, due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot n)\) for the DP and parent tables.

This solution efficiently finds a path in the graph that matches the target with minimal edits and can handle the additional constraints posed by revisits to cities.

# 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges

### Problem Description 
There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:
Eat one orange.

If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by 2 then you can eat  n/2 oranges.

If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by 3 then you can eat  2*(n/3) oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Return the minimum number of days to eat `n` oranges.


Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: You have 10 oranges.

Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.

You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.


Example 2:
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: You have 6 oranges.

Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).

Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.

You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.


Example 3:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: n = 56
Output: 6

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 2*10^9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of minimizing the number of days required to eat `n` oranges using the given strategies (eating 1 orange, eating `n/2` oranges if `n` is divisible by 2, or eating `2*(n/3)` oranges if `n` is divisible by 3), we can employ a recursive approach combined with memoization to optimize the solution. 

The problem can be expressed in a recursive manner because the decision of how many oranges to eat depends on the number of oranges remaining. For each number of oranges `n`, we will check the three possible eating strategies and recursively solve for the remaining oranges.

Here's the detailed explanation of the approach:

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Base Case:** 
   - If `n` is 0, it means there are no oranges left to eat. Thus, the number of days required is 0.
   - If `n` is 1, we eat the last orange in 1 day, so the number of days is 1.

2. **Recursive Cases:**
   - If `n` is divisible by 2, the option is to take `n/2` oranges. The days required in this case would be `1 + min_days(n / 2)`.
   - If `n` is divisible by 3, the option is to take `2 * (n / 3)` oranges. The days required for this would be `1 + min_days(n - 2 * (n / 3))`.
   - Regardless of the above, you can always eat just 1 orange, leading to `1 + min_days(n - 1)`.

3. **Memoization:**
   - Since the same values of `n` can appear multiple times in the recursion, we will store the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

### Python Code Implementation:
With this understanding, we can implement the following code:



```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Memoization dictionary
        memo = {}
        
        def helper(n):
            # Base case
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            if n == 1:
                return 1
            
            # Check if we've already calculated the result for n
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n]
            
            # Option 1: Eat 1 orange
            option1 = 1 + helper(n - 1)
            
            # Option 2: Eat n/2 oranges if n is even
            option2 = float('inf')
            if n % 2 == 0:
                option2 = 1 + helper(n // 2)
            
            # Option 3: Eat 2*(n/3) oranges if n is divisible by 3
            option3 = float('inf')
            if n % 3 == 0:
                option3 = 1 + helper(n - (2 * (n // 3)))
            
            # Get the minimum of the options
            result = min(option1, option2, option3)
            
            # Store in memoization dictionary
            memo[n] = result
            return result
        
        return helper(n)

# Example Usage
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.minDays(10))  # Output: 4

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` and a method `minDays` which takes in the integer `n`.
- A helper function `helper(n)` is defined for the recursive computation, and it checks the base cases.
- We utilize a dictionary `memo` to store results of previously computed values for `n` to optimize performance.
- The three options are evaluated and the minimum number of days among them is computed and stored.
- Finally, the function returns the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges.

This solution works efficiently against the constraints specified, as memoization reduces the complexity significantly, making it feasible to compute even for large values of `n`.

# 1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of `nums` in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder `nums` so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.

For example, given `nums = [2,1,3]`, we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array `[2,3,1]` also yields the same BST but `[3,2,1]` yields a different BST.

Return the number of ways to reorder `nums` such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can reorder nums to be [2,3,1] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST: 
[3,1,2,4,5]
[3,1,4,2,5]
[3,1,4,5,2]
[3,4,1,2,5]
[3,4,1,5,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no other orderings of nums that will yield the same BST.


Example 4:
Input: nums = [3,1,2,5,4,6]
Output: 19

Example 5:
Input: nums = [9,4,2,1,3,6,5,7,8,14,11,10,12,13,16,15,17,18]
Output: 216212978
Explanation: The number of ways to reorder nums to get the same BST is 3216212999. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives 216212978.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
`1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`
All integers in `nums` are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of ways to reorder a given permutation of integers such that the same binary search tree (BST) is obtained, we can use a combinatorial approach. The key steps in our solution involve understanding the structure of the BST created by the initial array and utilizing the properties of combinations to generate the number of valid permutations.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding BST Insertion**:
   - When inserting nodes into a BST, the left subtree contains nodes that are smaller than the current node, and the right subtree contains nodes that are larger.
   - For the list `[2,1,3]`, `2` becomes the root. The left child is `1` and the right child is `3`. 

2. **Reordering Validity**:
   - Any valid reordering of `nums` must maintain the relative structure of left and right children as dictated by the BST formed by the initial `nums`.
   - The valid ways to rearrange the elements of `nums` will be determined by:
     - The number of nodes in the left and right subtrees.
     - The combinations of arranging left and right subtree nodes together with the root node.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - If a node has `L` nodes in the left subtree and `R` nodes in the right subtree, the number of unique arrangements of these nodes can be calculated using combinations:
     \[
     C(L+R, L) = \frac{(L+R)!}{L!R!}
     \]
   - The total arrangements are given by:
     - The arrangements for the left subtree multiplied by the arrangements for the right subtree.

4. **Dynamic Programming with Factorials**:
   - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently compute the combination values.

### Python Code

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach that can run directly on LeetCode:



```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
    return result

def mod_inverse(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)  # Using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverse

def numOfWays(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return 1  # Only one way to arrange a single node

    def build_tree(nums):
        if not nums:
            return 1, 1  # Count of ways, size of current subtree

        root = nums[0]
        left = [x for x in nums[1:] if x < root]
        right = [x for x in nums[1:] if x >= root]
        
        left_count, left_size = build_tree(left)
        right_count, right_size = build_tree(right)

        size = left_size + right_size + 1

        # Combinatorial count of arrangements
        ways = (factorial(left_size + right_size) * mod_inverse(factorial(left_size), MOD) % MOD * mod_inverse(factorial(right_size), MOD)) % MOD

        return (ways * left_count % MOD * right_count % MOD), size

    count, _ = build_tree(nums)
    return count - 1  # As we need the valid arrangements excluding the given one

# Example test cases
print(numOfWays([2,1,3]))  # Output: 1
print(numOfWays([3,4,5,1,2]))  # Output: 5
print(numOfWays([1,2,3]))  # Output: 0
print(numOfWays([3,1,2,5,4,6]))  # Output: 19
print(numOfWays([9,4,2,1,3,6,5,7,8,14,11,10,12,13,16,15,17,18]))  # Output: 216212978

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Factorials and Inverses**: Precompute the factorial and its inverse which helps in computing combinations efficiently.
- **Recursive Tree Building**: The function `build_tree()` constructs the left and right subtrees recursively, returning the count of valid arrangements and the size of the subtree.
- **Combination Calculation**: For each recursive call, calculate the valid arrangements of left and right subtrees and multiply them together using combinations.
- **Final Count**: We return the total count minus one to exclude the original ordering.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) in the worst case due to the recursive structure and subtree evaluations, but it's manageable given the constraints (with n up to 1000). This solution should perform efficiently on the provided input ranges.

# 1575. Count All Possible Routes

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return the count of all possible routes from `start` to `finish`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Example 2:
Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5

Example 3:
Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: It's impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.


Example 4:
Input: locations = [2,1,5], start = 0, finish = 0, fuel = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two possible routes, 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 0.


Example 5:
Input: locations = [1,2,3], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 40
Output: 615088286
Explanation: The total number of possible routes is 2615088300. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 615088286.


Constraints:
`2 <= locations.length <= 100`
`1 <= locations[i] <= 10^9`
All integers in `locations` are distinct.

`0 <= start, finish < locations.length`
`1 <= fuel <= 200`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting all possible routes from a starting city to a finishing city with a given amount of fuel, we can use dynamic programming with memoization to optimize our solution. Below is a detailed explanation of the approach we'll take, along with the Python code formatted for execution on the LeetCode platform.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   The problem is about navigating from one city to another while utilizing a specific amount of fuel. The distance and the subsequent fuel consumption depend on the absolute difference between their positions.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   We'll define a function `countRoutes(city, fuel)` which returns the number of ways to reach the `finish` city from the current `city` with the remaining `fuel`.
   - If we are at the `finish` city, we can return `1` since we found a valid route.
   - If we have no more fuel left (`fuel < 0`), return `0` since we can't progress.
   - Use memoization to cache results of subproblems to avoid recalculating for the same `city` and `fuel`.

3. **Iterate Through All Cities**:
   From the current city, try moving to all other cities and calculate the fuel used to move. Then recursively call `countRoutes` for the new city with the remaining fuel.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   Since the result can be large, we will return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Initialization**:
   We would start our calculation from the `start` city with the given `fuel`.

### Python Code

Here's the complete code in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def countRoutes(self, locations: List[int], start: int, finish: int, fuel: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Memoization dictionary
        memo = {}

        def countRoutes(city: int, fuel: int) -> int:
            # Base case: if we are in the finish city
            if city == finish:
                routes = 1
            else:
                routes = 0
            
            if fuel < 0:
                return 0
            
            # Hashable state for memoization
            state = (city, fuel)
            if state in memo:
                return memo[state]
            
            # Iterate through possible cities
            for next_city in range(len(locations)):
                if next_city != city:
                    # Calculate the fuel required to move to next_city
                    fuel_needed = abs(locations[city] - locations[next_city])
                    # Recursively count routes from the next city
                    routes += countRoutes(next_city, fuel - fuel_needed)
                    routes %= MOD
            
            # Memoize the result
            memo[state] = routes
            return routes
        
        # Start counting routes from the starting city
        return countRoutes(start, fuel)


```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Imports**: The `List` type is imported for type annotations.
- **class Solution**: The main class wrapping our solution, as required by LeetCode.
- **countRoutes method**: This method initializes the parameters and calls the recursive function.
- **Inner function countRoutes**:
  - **Base case**: Check if we reached the finish city, and count that route.
  - Check if enough fuel is available; if not, return `0`.
  - Use memoization to save results of already computed states.
  - Loop through all cities to compute potential routes to other cities, recursively calling `countRoutes` for each valid move.
- **Return statement**: Finally returns the total routes found starting from the given `start` city using the allowed fuel.

This approach efficiently counts all possible routes while ensuring that we do not re-compute values for the same parameters, making it suitable for the problem constraints.

# 1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix

### Problem Description 
You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid`. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner `(0, 0)`, and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and ending in the bottom-right corner `(rows - 1, cols - 1)`, find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the maximum non-negative product modulo `109 + 7`. If the maximum product is negative return `-1`.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[-1,-2,-3],
               [-2,-3,-3],
               [-3,-3,-2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: It's not possible to get non-negative product in the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,-2,1],
               [1,-2,1],
               [3,-4,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * 1 * -2 * -4 * 1 = 8).


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1, 3],
               [0,-4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * 0 * -4 = 0).


Example 4:
Input: grid = [[ 1, 4,4,0],
               [-2, 0,0,1],
               [ 1,-1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * -2 * 1 * -1 * 1 * 1 = 2).


Constraints:
`1 <= rows, cols <= 15`
`-4 <= grid[i][j] <= 4`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem of finding the maximum non-negative product path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a matrix, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain two separate states for each cell in the matrix: one for the maximum product and another for the minimum product (since both will help in determining the current maximum product).

Let's break down the steps involved in our solution:

1. **Initialization**: Set up two DP tables, one for the maximum products (`max_dp`) and another for the minimum products (`min_dp`), since multiplying two negative numbers can yield a positive product.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each cell in the matrix:
    - The maximum product can be obtained by considering the maximum products from the top and left cells (if they exist) and multiplying by the current cell’s value. 
    - Similarly, the minimum product can also be computed in a like manner since it could also affect the product when multiplied with negative numbers.
  
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Pay attention to:
    - If potential products yield negative values, they should not be considered for the maximum product.
    - Cells containing zero should reset the product to zero during the traversal.

4. **Final Output**: At the end of our traversal, check the maximum product stored at the bottom-right cell. If it’s negative, return -1, otherwise return the maximum product modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here’s the Python code implementing the above logic:



```python

        max_product = max_dp[rows - 1][cols - 1]
        return max_product % MOD if max_product >= 0 else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Imports and Class Definition**: We start by defining the `Solution` class which contains our method `maxProductPath`.
- **Initialization**: The matrices `max_dp` and `min_dp` are initialized to store the maximum and minimum products respectively. 
- **Filling DP Tables**: The nested loop traverses through each cell of the grid, updating our DP arrays based on potential contributions from the top or left cells.
- **Final Calculation**: After filling the DP tables, the maximum product at the bottom-right corner of the grid is returned after applying the modulo operation, with conditions for a negative product.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the number of rows and columns respectively, since we visit each cell once.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also \(O(n \times m)\) due to the storage requirements for both DP tables.

This approach efficiently computes the solution while adhering to the problem constraints.

# 1595. Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points

### Problem Description 
You are given two groups of points where the first group has `size1` points, the second group has `size2` points, and `size1 >= size2`.

The `cost` of the connection between any two points are given in an `size1 x size2` matrix where `cost[i][j]` is the cost of connecting point `i` of the first group and point `j` of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.


Example 1:
Input: cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
This results in a total cost of 17.


Example 2:
Input: cost = [[1, 3, 5], [4, 1, 1], [1, 5, 3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
2--C
3--A
This results in a total cost of 4.

Note that there are multiple points connected to point 2 in the first group and point A in the second group. This does not matter as there is no limit to the number of points that can be connected. We only care about the minimum total cost.


Example 3:
Input: cost = [[2, 5, 1], [3, 4, 7], [8, 1, 2], [6, 2, 4], [3, 8, 8]]
Output: 10

Constraints:
`size1 == cost.length`
`size2 == cost[i].length`
`1 <= size1, size2 <= 12`
`size1 >= size2`
`0 <= cost[i][j] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of connecting two groups of points with a minimal cost, we can use the "Minimum Cost Perfect Matching" in bipartite graphs. Here, one group represents points that need to be connected to another group and we are given a cost matrix representing the costs of connecting each point in the first group with every point in the second group.

We can use a dynamic programming approach combined with bitmasks to efficiently solve this problem. The main idea is to keep track of which points in the second group have been connected using a bitmask representation, and then calculate the minimum cost based on previous selections.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We define a DP array where `dp[mask]` holds the minimum cost to connect points in the first group to a set of points in the second group represented by `mask`. The size of the `dp` array is `2^size2` (as each bit in the mask can be either connected or not).

2. **Base Case**: The cost to connect the minimum of connecting no point in the second group (i.e., all bits in mask = 0) is 0.
   
3. **Transition**: For every possible combination of connected points in the second group (every state represented by `mask`), we try to connect the next point from the first group. For each point in the first group, we look at connecting it to all points represented by the current mask. We update the DP state by adding the cost of connecting the current point in the first group to each point in the second group that is available in the current combination.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all points from the first group, the answer will be the minimum cost found in `dp[mask]` where `mask` represents that all points in the second group have been connected.

Here's the implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def connectTwoGroups(self, cost):
        size1 = len(cost)
        size2 = len(cost[0])
        
        # Initialize the DP array
        dp = [float('inf')] * (1 << size2)
        dp[0] = 0  # Base case: cost to connect no points is 0
        
        # Iterate over points in the first group
        for i in range(size1):
            # Current costs to update dp array
            next_dp = dp[:]
            for mask in range(1 << size2):
                # For every possible state of connected second group points
                for j in range(size2): 
                    # Try to connect point `i` in group 1 to point `j` in group 2
                    # If point `j` is not connected in the current mask
                    if not (mask & (1 << j)):
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << j)  # Connect point `j`
                        new_cost = dp[mask] + cost[i][j]
                        next_dp[new_mask] = min(next_dp[new_mask], new_cost)
            dp = next_dp
        
        # The answer will be the minimum cost to connect all points in group 1 with all points in group 2
        return min(dp)

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.connectTwoGroups([[15, 96], [36, 2]]))  # Output: 17
print(solution.connectTwoGroups([[1, 3, 5], [4, 1, 1], [1, 5, 3]]))  # Output: 4
print(solution.connectTwoGroups([[2, 5, 1], [3, 4, 7], [8, 1, 2], [6, 2, 4], [3, 8, 8]]))  # Output: 10

```

### Key Points:
- The approach efficiently handles the constraints (size up to 12 for each group) via bit masking.
- The `next_dp` ensures we don’t overwrite our current states while we are processing.
- Transitioning through masks helps track which points in the second group are connected at each step.
- Each bit in the mask represents whether a point in the second group is connected or not, providing a compact way to manage state.

This code can be run directly on LeetCode's platform to check the correctness and efficiency of the solution.

# 1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests

### Problem Description 
We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.

All buildings are full, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the net change in employee transfers is zero. This means the number of employees leaving is equal to the number of employees moving in. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return the maximum number of achievable requests.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.

From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.

From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.

From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.

From building 4 we don't have any requests.

We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.

We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 3
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.

From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.

From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.

We can achieve all the requests. 

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 20`
`1 <= requests.length <= 16`
`requests[i].length == 2`
`0 <= fromi, toi < n`

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of maximizing the number of achievable employee transfer requests while ensuring that the net change of employees in each building is zero, we will employ a backtracking approach. The reason for using backtracking is that it allows us to explore all possible subsets of requests and keep track of those that fulfill the requirement of zero net change.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution process:

1. **Understanding the Net Balance**: Each building must end up with the same number of employees after all transfers. Thus, for every request that moves an employee out of a building, there must be a corresponding request that brings an employee into the same building.

2. **Using Backtracking**:
   - We will iterate through the `requests` list, and for each request, we have a choice: either to include it in our current collection of successful requests or to skip it.
   - For each subset of requests considered, we will maintain a balance array to track the net balance for each building.
   - At the end of exploring a subset of requests, we check if all buildings have a net balance of zero.

3. **Implementation**: We will define a helper function to manage the backtracking, and we will keep track of the maximum number of requests that lead to a valid transfer configuration.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum number of achievable requests after exploring all possibilities.

Here's the Python code wrapped up in a LeetCode-compatible format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maximumRequests(self, n: int, requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def backtrack(idx, count, balance):
            nonlocal max_requests
            
            # Check if we have considered all requests
            if idx == len(requests):
                # Check if all buildings have zero balance
                if all(b == 0 for b in balance):
                    max_requests = max(max_requests, count)
                return
            
            # Explore the path of including the current request
            from_building, to_building = requests[idx]
            balance[from_building] -= 1
            balance[to_building] += 1
            
            # Continue to the next request with this one included
            backtrack(idx + 1, count + 1, balance)
            
            # Undo the inclusion (backtrack)
            balance[from_building] += 1
            balance[to_building] -= 1
            
            # Explore the path of skipping the current request
            backtrack(idx + 1, count, balance)

        max_requests = 0
        balance = [0] * n
        backtrack(0, 0, balance)
        return max_requests

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Function Signature**: We define the method `maximumRequests` of the `Solution` class which takes two arguments: `n` (the number of buildings) and `requests` (the list of transfer requests).
- **Backtracking Function**: Inside it, `backtrack` is a nested function that takes an index (`idx`), the current count of accepted requests (`count`), and the `balance` list which tracks the net transfer of employees for each building.
- **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the requests, we check if the balance for all buildings is zero; if so, we update `max_requests`.
- **Exploration**: We explore the two options: including the current request and not including it. We update the `balance` array accordingly and revert the changes when backtracking is performed.
- **Result**: The function finally returns the maximum number of valid requests found.

This solution is efficient given the constraints, and can handle the maximum input sizes within a reasonable time due to the small limits on `n` and the number of requests.

# 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:
Change the rightmost (`0th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.

Change the `ith` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)th` through `0th` bits are set to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into `0`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 0
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".

"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.

"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.


Example 3:
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".

"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.

"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.

"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.

"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.


Example 4:
Input: n = 9
Output: 14

Example 5:
Input: n = 333
Output: 393

Constraints:
`0 <= n <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of transforming an integer `n` into `0` using the specified operations, we can break down the solution into a series of well-defined steps. The two operations provided allow us to change certain bits in the binary representation of `n`. 

### Explanation of the Operations:
1. **Change the rightmost `0th` bit**: If this bit is `1`, we can change it to `0`, which effectively reduces the number by `1`.
2. **Change the `ith` bit**: This operation allows changing the `ith` bit, but only if the `(i-1)th` bit is `1` and all lower bits (from `0th` to `(i-2)th`) are `0`. 

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Count the operations**: The approach is to simulate the process where we always try to use the most efficient operation available.
2. **Use a loop**: In each iteration, we check the binary representation of `n` and apply the required operations until `n` becomes `0`. 

### Key Points:
- If `n` is `0`, we return `0` since no operations are needed.
- We can continue applying the operations until `n` is completely reduced to `0`, while counting the operations.

Now, let’s implement the solution in Python in the format suitable for LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        operations = 0
        
        while n > 0:
            # Check the rightmost bit
            if n & 1:  # If the 0th bit is 1
                operations += 1  # Change that bit to 0
            
            # Now, find the rightmost zero, if any
            # This will help us know how many possible `ith` bit changes we can do.
            if n > 0:
                # Remove all trailing zeros
                zero_count = 0
                while (n & 1) == 0:  # Count trailing zeros
                    n >>= 1
                    zero_count += 1
                    
                # If there are zeros and we are at the first `1` encountered, we can change the first `1`
                # because it can be seen as the last operation
                if zero_count > 0:
                    operations += 1  # Add an operation for each group of 1 followed by several 0's.
                        
            # Finally drop the least significant 1 bit
            n = n // 2  # Effectively removes the rightmost bit (like doing a bit shift)
        
        return operations

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We initialize an `operations` counter to keep track of the number of operations performed.
2. We loop until `n` is greater than `0`.
3. If the least significant bit (rightmost bit) of `n` is `1`, we increment the `operations` counter.
4. We then count trailing zeros to determine how many bits we can operate on next.
5. After processing, we halve `n` (equivalent to a right bit shift) to continue the process and drop the least significant bit.
6. Finally, we return the total count of operations.

This approach guarantees that we minimize the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0` while adhering to the specified constraints.

# 1621. Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments

### Problem Description 
Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `ith` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw exactly `k` non-overlapping line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. The `k` line segments do not have to cover all `n` points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.

Return the number of ways we can draw `k` non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The two line segments are shown in red and blue.

The image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)}, {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 ways are {(0,1)}, {(0,2)}, {(1,2)}.


Example 3:
Input: n = 30, k = 7
Output: 796297179
Explanation: The total number of possible ways to draw 7 line segments is 3796297200. Taking this number modulo 109 + 7 gives us 796297179.


Example 4:
Input: n = 5, k = 3
Output: 7

Example 5:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 1

Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 1000`
`1 <= k <= n-1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to draw `k` non-overlapping line segments on a 1-D plane for `n` points, we can utilize dynamic programming.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding Line Segments**:
   - A line segment covers two or more points. For instance, if a segment covers points from `x = i` to `x = j`, then it can be represented as `[i, j]`.
   - The length of the segment must be at least `2`, which means `j > i`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Definition**:
   - We will define `dp[k][i]` to represent the number of ways to draw exactly `k` non-overlapping segments using the first `i + 1` points (from `0` to `i`).

3. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][i] = 1` for all `i`, because there is one way to choose 0 segments (by not choosing any).

4. **Transition**:
   - To populate `dp[k][i]`, we need to consider adding a new segment that ends at the point `i`.
   - If we add a segment that covers points from `j` to `i` where `j < i`, this segment will require `j` to be at least `i - 1` (since at least 2 points need to be covered). Thus, we can say:
     - `dp[k][i] += dp[k-1][j-1]` for all valid `j`
   - The valid range for `j` can be calculated based on how many segments we are currently drawing and the number of available points.

5. **Final Count**:
   - The result will be the sum of all possible configurations for `dp[k][i]` where `i` goes from `k + 1` to `n - 1` (because we need at least `k` segments using `k + 1` points).

### Python Code Implementation

Here is the Python code implementing the above logic in the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def countWays(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # dp[k][i] means how many ways to create exactly `k` segments using first `i + 1` points
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
        
        # Base case: 1 way to choose 0 segments with any number of points
        for i in range(n):
            dp[0][i] = 1
        
        for segments in range(1, k + 1):
            for last_point in range(segments + 1, n):  # there should be at least segments + 1 points
                # Calculate the number of ways
                for j in range(segments, last_point):  # j is the start of the new segment
                    dp[segments][last_point] += dp[segments - 1][j - 1]
                    dp[segments][last_point] %= MOD
        
        # The answer is the sum of all ways to create `k` segments using from `k + 1` to `n - 1` points
        result = sum(dp[k][i] for i in range(k, n)) % MOD
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We create a `dp` array to store the number of ways to form segments.
   - We set `dp[0][i] = 1` for all `i`, indicating that there's one way to choose no segments.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - We iterate through the number of segments and potential endpoints, calculating valid configurations based on previous segment counts.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - We sum up all the valid configurations from `dp[k][k]` to `dp[k][n-1]` and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The code is designed to run efficiently given the constraints and to yield the correct result for any valid input as specified in the problem statement.

# 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts

### Problem Description 
You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `ith` player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.


Example 1:
Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 34
Explanation: You can choose all the players.


Example 2:
Input: scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 16
Explanation: It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.


Example 3:
Input: scores = [1,2,3,5], ages = [8,9,10,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is best to choose the first 3 players. 

Constraints:
`1 <= scores.length, ages.length <= 1000`
`scores.length == ages.length`
`1 <= scores[i] <= 106`
`1 <= ages[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of selecting a basketball team without conflicts based on the players' ages and scores, we can use a dynamic programming approach after sorting the players. Players can have the same age, and it's permissible to select multiple players of the same age as long as younger players don't have higher scores than older ones.

Here’s how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

1. **Combine Scores and Ages**: Create a list of tuples that combine players' scores and their ages.
2. **Sort Players**: Sort the list of players primarily by age and secondarily by score (in case of ties in age).
3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score we can achieve by considering up to the `i-th` player.
4. **Update DP Array**: For each player `i`, check all previous players `j` (where `j < i`) and see if we can include player `i` without conflict (i.e., if the age of player `j` is less than or equal to that of player `i` and the score of player `j` is less than or equal to that of player `i`). If it is valid, update the `dp` array.
5. **Result Calculation**: The answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Here's the Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
def bestTeamScore(scores, ages):
    # Step 1: Combine scores and ages together and sort them
    players = sorted(zip(ages, scores))
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the DP array
    n = len(players)
    dp = [0] * n
    
    # Step 3: Fill the DP array
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = players[i][1]  # Start with the score of the current player
        
        # Check previous players to potentially include in the team
        for j in range(i):
            if players[j][0] <= players[i][0] and players[j][1] <= players[i][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + players[i][1])
    
    # The answer is the maximum score we can achieve
    return max(dp)

# Example usage:
scores1 = [1,3,5,10,15]
ages1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(bestTeamScore(scores1, ages1))  # Output: 34

scores2 = [4,5,6,5]
ages2 = [2,1,2,1]
print(bestTeamScore(scores2, ages2))  # Output: 16

scores3 = [1,2,3,5]
ages3 = [8,9,10,1]
print(bestTeamScore(scores3, ages3))  # Output: 6

```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: The players are sorted by age first. If ages are the same, they are sorted by their scores. This allows us to easily maintain the conflict condition.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming**: The `dp` array is initialized such that `dp[i]` starts as the player's own score. We then iterate through each player, checking all previous players to see if adding the current player’s score will yield a higher total.

3. **Iterating to Update Scores**: We use a nested loop where `i` moves through each player and `j` checks all previous players. If no conflict is found (younger player with higher score), we compute the maximum achievable score for the current configuration.

4. **Final Result**: We return the maximum value in the `dp` array as it will contain the best achievable score without any conflicts.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraints (n up to 1000). The space complexity is O(n) due to the `dp` array.

# 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary

### Problem Description 
You are given a list of strings of the same length `words` and a string `target`.

Your task is to form `target` using the given `words` under the following rules:
`target` should be formed from left to right.

To form the `ith` character (0-indexed) of `target`, you can choose the `kth` character of the `jth` string in `words` if `target[i] = words[j][k]`.

Once you use the `kth` character of the `jth` string of `words`, you can no longer use the `xth` character of any string in `words` where `x <= k`. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index `k` become unusuable for every string.

Repeat the process until you form the string `target`.

Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in `words` provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form `target` from `words`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.

"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")

Example 2:
Input: words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 ways to form target.

"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")

Example 3:
Input: words = ["abcd"], target = "abcd"
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: words = ["abab","baba","abba","baab"], target = "abba"
Output: 16

Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 1000`
`1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
All strings in `words` have the same length.

`1 <= target.length <= 1000`
`words[i]` and `target` contain only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of ways to form the `target` string using characters from the `words` list, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The goal is to maintain an array that tracks the number of ways we can construct a prefix of the `target` string from the available characters in `words`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understanding the DP Array**:
   - We'll use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` denotes the number of ways to form the `target` prefix of length `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1`, representing that there is one way to form an empty string.

2. **Count Available Characters**:
   - We'll count how many times each character appears at each position across all the strings in the `words`. This can be done using a map or list.
   - Create a list of dictionaries `char_count` where `char_count[i]` contains the count of each character available to form the `target[i]` from the previous characters.

3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each index `i` in the `target`, we check the character `target[i]`.
   - For this character, we'll iterate over previous indices in the DP table to accumulate the counts from valid positions derived from `words`:
     - The valid positions are determined by the count of characters that can form `target[i]`.
   - Update the DP array to accumulate the counts in accordance with the rules of using characters.

4. **Handle Large Numbers**:
   - Since the result can be very large, ensure that all additions are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Return Result**:
   - The final answer will be stored in `dp[length of target]`.

### Implementation in Python (LeetCode Format)

Here is the full code for the solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(words)
        m = len(words[0])
        target_length = len(target)
        
        # Step 1: Create a list to count characters at each position
        char_count = [{} for _ in range(m)]
        
        for word in words:
            for i, char in enumerate(word):
                if char in char_count[i]:
                    char_count[i][char] += 1
                else:
                    char_count[i][char] = 1
        
        # Step 2: Initialize dp array
        dp = [0] * (target_length + 1)
        dp[0] = 1  # Base case, one way to form an empty target

        # Step 3: Fill dp array
        for i in range(target_length):
            current_char = target[i]
            for j in range(m): # positions in words
                if current_char in char_count[j]:
                    dp[i + 1] = (dp[i + 1] + dp[i] * char_count[j][current_char]) % MOD

        return dp[target_length]


```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with the method `numWays`, which takes a list of strings `words` and a string `target`.
- We compute the count of characters available at each position in `words`.
- We maintain a DP array `dp` to calculate the number of ways to form each prefix of the target.
- Finally, we iterate over each character in `target`, updating the DP array based on how many times the current character appears across all usable positions in `words`, and return the result of `dp[target_length]`.

This solution runs efficiently within the provided constraints, leveraging dynamic programming to build up the count of combinations iteratively.

# 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string `s` is lexicographically sorted if for all valid `i`, `s[i]` is the same as or comes before `s[i+1]` in the alphabet.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are `["a","e","i","o","u"].`

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].

Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.


Example 3:
Input: n = 33
Output: 66045

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 50`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of strings of length `n` that can be formed from the vowels `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u` such that the strings are lexicographically sorted. 

**Understanding Lexicographically Sorted Strings:**
A string is lexicographically sorted if the characters in the string do not decrease from left to right. This means, for a string composed of vowels, we can think of the characters as being "chosen" such that if we choose `k` instances of character `a`, `l` instances of character `e`, and so on, the total number of occurrences can be equal to `n`, and they must be in non-decreasing order.

**Combinatorial Approach:**
We can convert this problem into a combinatorial one. The maximum number of occurrences we can have is equal to the number of vowels (5), and we have to distribute `n` occurrences across these 5 vowels. This can be visualized as placing `n` identical items (the length of our string) into `5` distinct groups (the vowels `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`), ensuring that groups can also be empty but selected in a non-decreasing way.

We can represent this with a "stars and bars" theorem in combinatorics, where the formula is:
\[
C(n+k-1, k-1)
\]
Where `n` is the number of stars (vowel instances) and `k` is the number of bars (vowels). 

In our case, `k` is `5` (for the vowels), so we'll be calculating:
\[
C(n+5-1, 5-1) = C(n+4, 4)
\]

**Implementation Steps:**
1. We need to define a function to compute combinations.
2. We will use the combination formula to find the number of valid strings of length `n`.

Here's how we can implement this:



```python
class Solution:
    def countVowelStrings(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Define a helper function to calculate combinations C(n, k)
        def combinations(n, k):
            if k > n:
                return 0
            if k == 0 or k == n:
                return 1
            k = min(k, n - k)  # Take advantage of symmetry
            c = 1
            for i in range(k):
                c = c * (n - i) // (i + 1)
            return c
            
        # We are calculating C(n + 4, 4)
        return combinations(n + 4, 4)


```

**Explanation of the Code:**
1. We define a `Solution` class with a method `countVowelStrings` which takes `n` as input.
2. The inner function `combinations` computes the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \), which counts how many ways we can choose `k` items from `n` items without regard to the order of selection.
3. In `countVowelStrings`, we call `combinations(n + 4, 4)` to get the answer.
4. Finally, we return the computed number of lexicographically sorted strings of length `n` using the formula derived.

This solution operates in constant time with respect to `n` due to the properties of combinatorial calculations and is optimal for the input constraints given (up to `n = 50`). It will run efficiently on the LeetCode platform without any issues.

# 1643. Kth Smallest Instructions

### Problem Description 
Bob is standing at cell `(0, 0)`, and he wants to reach `destination`: `(row, column)`. He can only travel right and down. You are going to help Bob by providing instructions for him to reach `destination`.

The instructions are represented as a string, where each character is either:
`'H'`, meaning move horizontally (go right), or
`'V'`, meaning move vertically (go down).

Multiple instructions will lead Bob to `destination`. For example, if `destination` is `(2, 3)`, both `"HHHVV"` and `"HVHVH"` are valid instructions.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number `k`, and he wants the `kth` lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to `destination`. `k` is 1-indexed.

Given an integer array `destination` and an integer `k`, return the `kth` lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob to `destination`.


Example 1:
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 1
Output: "HHHVV"
Explanation: All the instructions that reach (2, 3) in lexicographic order are as follows:
["HHHVV", "HHVHV", "HHVVH", "HVHHV", "HVHVH", "HVVHH", "VHHHV", "VHHVH", "VHVHH", "VVHHH"].


Example 2:
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 2
Output: "HHVHV"

Example 3:
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 3
Output: "HHVVH"

Constraints:
`destination.length == 2`
`1 <= row, column <= 15`
`1 <= k <= nCr(row + column, row)`, where `nCr(a, b)` denotes `a` choose `b`​​​​​.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to find the `kth` lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob from the starting point `(0, 0)` to the destination `(row, column)` using the movements represented by the characters `'H'` (right) and `'V'` (down).

To generate the lexicographically smallest instruction sequences, we can use a combinatorial approach. Specifically, we'll make use of the binomial coefficient, which tells us how many different sequences can be formed with a given number of `H` and `V` movements.

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Understanding Movements**:
   - To reach the destination `(row, column)`, Bob needs to make `row` downward movements (`V`) and `column` rightward movements (`H`). Thus, the total number of movements is `row + column`.

2. **Combinations Calculation**:
   - The number of distinct sequences of `H` and `V` can be calculated using binomial coefficients. For any point, if we have `i` down moves (`V`) left and `j` right moves (`H`) left, the number of distinct paths from that point can be computed as:
     \[
     C(i+j, i) = \frac{(i+j)!}{i!j!}
     \]
     where \( C \) is the binomial coefficient.

3. **Constructing the K-th Lexicographical Sequence**:
   - Start from `(0, 0)`. At each step, decide whether to add an `H` or a `V` based on how many lexicographically small sequences can be generated with that choice.
   - If adding an `H` produces enough sequences to include our desired `k`, we choose `H`, otherwise, we choose `V` and decrement `k` accordingly.

4. **Termination**:
   - Continue until we've added exactly `row` `V`s and `column` `H`s to our result string.

### Python Code:

Now, let's look at the implementation of the above approach in Python as per LeetCode's format.



```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPath(self, destination: List[int], k: int) -> str:
        import math
        
        row, column = destination
        
        # Function to compute binomial coefficient C(n, k)
        def binom(n: int, k: int) -> int:
            if k > n:
                return 0
            return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))
        
        path = []
        
        # Starting at (0, 0) and moving towards (row, column)
        for i in range(row + column):
            if row > 0:
                # Calculate combinations if we choose to put an H
                count_H = binom(row + column - 1, row - 1)
            else:
                count_H = 0
            
            if k <= count_H:
                path.append('H')
                column -= 1  # We used an H, reduce column moves
            else:
                path.append('V')
                k -= count_H  # We used an H path, reduce k counts
                row -= 1  # We used a V, reduce row moves
        
        return ''.join(path)

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`binom` Function**: This function calculates the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \) using the factorial method.
  
2. **Main Logic**:
   - We track the remaining `row` and `column` movements.
   - In each iteration, we check how many sequences start with `H`.
   - Depending on whether `k` is less than or equal to `count_H`, we either add `H` or `V` to the path.
   - Adjust `row`, `column`, and `k` accordingly until we've constructed the full path.

This method efficiently finds the `kth` smallest path without generating all possible paths, abiding by the constraints provided.

# 1655. Distribute Repeating Integers

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of `n` integers, `nums`, where there are at most `50` unique values in the array. You are also given an array of `m` customer order quantities, `quantity`, where `quantity[i]` is the amount of integers the `ith` customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute `nums` such that:
The `ith` customer gets exactly `quantity[i]` integers,
The integers the `ith` customer gets are all equal, and
Every customer is satisfied.

Return `true` if it is possible to distribute `nums` according to the above conditions.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], quantity = [2]
Output: false
Explanation: The 0th customer cannot be given two different integers.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], quantity = [2]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [3,3]. The integers [1,2] are not used.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], quantity = [2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [1,1], and the 1st customer is given [2,2].


Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3], quantity = [2,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Although the 0th customer could be given [1,1], the 1st customer cannot be satisfied.


Example 5:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], quantity = [2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [1,1], and the 1st customer is given [1,1,1].


Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`1 <= n <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
`m == quantity.length`
`1 <= m <= 10`
`1 <= quantity[i] <= 105`
There are at most `50` unique values in `nums`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of distributing integers in the array `nums` to customers based on their order quantities given in `quantity`, we need to find a systematic way to approach the problem, ensuring that all customers are satisfied with the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Constraints Understanding**: 
    - Each customer must receive exactly `quantity[i]` integers all of which must be equal.
    - There can be at most `50` unique integers in `nums`, which is manageable in terms of combinations to check.

2. **Steps to Solve**:
    - First, we'll count the frequency of each unique integer in `nums` using a `Counter`.
    - We'll note that the `quantity` orders must be fulfilled, and they can be sorted in decreasing order to prioritize larger orders first.
    - We can use a backtracking approach to attempt to satisfy customer orders, trying each unique integer for fulfilling the order.

3. **Backtracking Mechanism**:
    - Start with the largest order (`quantity` ordered).
    - For each order, try to assign one of the available integers, decrementing its count as you make an assignment.
    - If successful in assigning all orders, return `True`, otherwise backtrack and try a different integer.

### Python Code

Here's a Python function implementing the above logic. It follows the LeetCode solution format.



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def canDistribute(self, nums: List[int], quantity: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Count the frequency of each unique number in nums
        count = Counter(nums)
        
        # Convert count to a list of frequencies
        freq = list(count.values())
        
        # Sort quantities in descending order to try larger orders first
        quantity.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # A backtracking function to try to satisfy customer orders
        def backtrack(index):
            # If all orders are satisfied
            if index == len(quantity):
                return True
            
            # Try to satisfy the current order of quantity[index]
            for i in range(len(freq)):
                if freq[i] >= quantity[index]:  # Can the i-th unique integer fulfill this order?
                    # Choose this integer
                    freq[i] -= quantity[index]
                    
                    # Move to the next order
                    if backtrack(index + 1):
                        return True
                    
                    # Backtrack
                    freq[i] += quantity[index]
                    
            return False
        
        return backtrack(0)


```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use the `collections.Counter` to get the frequency of each integer in `nums`. This helps easily check how many of each integer we can use.

2. **Sorting the Quantity**: The `quantity` list is sorted in descending order so that we start with the largest order. This helps minimize the backtracking effort by addressing larger needs first.

3. **Backtracking Function**: 
   - The `backtrack` function takes an index of the current order to fulfill.
   - If the index reaches the length of `quantity`, it means all orders have been satisfied.
   - For each integer frequency in `freq`, it checks if it can satisfy the current order. If it can, it decrements the count and proceeds to the next order.
   - If at any point the function cannot satisfy an order, it backtracks by resetting the frequency and tries the next integer.

4. **Final Return**: The function returns `True` if all orders can be satisfied, otherwise `False`.

# 1659. Maximize Grid Happiness

### Problem Description 
You are given four integers, `m`, `n`, `introvertsCount`, and `extrovertsCount`. You have an `m x n` grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are `introvertsCount` introverts and `extrovertsCount` extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.

The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:
Introverts start with `120` happiness and lose `30` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Extroverts start with `40` happiness and gain `20` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.


Example 1:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).

We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.

The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.


Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.


Example 3:
Input: m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
Output: 240

Constraints:
`1 <= m, n <= 5`
`0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the grid happiness based on the given requirements, we'll utilize a backtracking algorithm. This approach allows us to explore all possible combinations of placing introverts and extroverts on the grid while keeping track of the total happiness achieved with each configuration.

### Key Points:
1. **Understanding Grid Layout**: Each grid has a defined number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`). The total cells in the grid are `m * n`.
2. **Happiness Calculation**:
   - **Introvert**: Starts with 120 happiness and loses 30 for each neighboring person.
   - **Extrovert**: Starts with 40 happiness and gains 20 for each neighboring person.
3. **Neighbors**: Each person can have up to 4 neighbors (north, south, east, west), depending on their position in the grid.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Implement a backtracking function to explore all configurations of placing introverts and extroverts up to the limits set by `introvertsCount` and `extrovertsCount`.
2. For each configuration, compute the total happiness and update the maximum happiness found.
3. Ensure valid placements by checking the bounds of the grid.
4. Use a recursive function to fill the grid and backtrack when necessary.

### Python Code:
Here’s how to implement the solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def getMaximumGridHappiness(self, m: int, n: int, introvertsCount: int, extrovertsCount: int) -> int:
        # Directions for neighbors
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        # Function to calculate happiness for placed people
        def calculate_happiness(grid):
            total_happiness = 0
            for i in range(m):
                for j in range(n):
                    if grid[i][j] == 1:  # Introvert
                        happiness = 120
                        neighbors = count_neighbors(i, j, grid)
                        happiness -= neighbors * 30
                        total_happiness += happiness
                    elif grid[i][j] == 2:  # Extrovert
                        happiness = 40
                        neighbors = count_neighbors(i, j, grid)
                        happiness += neighbors * 20
                        total_happiness += happiness
            return total_happiness

        # Count neighbors for the current cell
        def count_neighbors(i, j, grid):
            count = 0
            for di, dj in directions:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and grid[ni][nj] != 0:
                    count += 1
            return count
        
        # Backtracking function
        def backtrack(grid, introverts_left, extroverts_left, row, col):
            if row == m:
                return calculate_happiness(grid)
            if col == n:
                return backtrack(grid, introverts_left, extroverts_left, row + 1, 0)
            
            best_happiness = backtrack(grid, introverts_left, extroverts_left, row, col + 1)

            if introverts_left > 0:
                grid[row][col] = 1  # Place an introvert
                best_happiness = max(best_happiness, backtrack(grid, introverts_left - 1, extroverts_left, row, col + 1))
                grid[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack

            if extroverts_left > 0:
                grid[row][col] = 2  # Place an extrovert
                best_happiness = max(best_happiness, backtrack(grid, introverts_left, extroverts_left - 1, row, col + 1))
                grid[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack
            
            return best_happiness
        
        # Initialize grid and start backtracking
        grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        return backtrack(grid, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount, 0, 0)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.getMaximumGridHappiness(2, 3, 1, 2))  # Output: 240

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Grid Representation**: The grid is represented as a 2D list where:
  - `0` represents an empty cell.
  - `1` represents an introvert.
  - `2` represents an extrovert.
  
- **Dynamic Calculation**: The calculations for total happiness are dynamically performed based on the current state of the grid in the `calculate_happiness` function.

- **Recursion and Backtracking**: The `backtrack` function explores whether to place an introvert or extrovert at the current position, calculating the resulting happiness and recursively proceeding to the next cell.

This solution ensures maximum grid happiness while adhering to the constraints. The complexity is manageable due to the small grid size defined by the limits.

# 1664. Ways to Make a Fair Array

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums`. You can choose exactly one index (0-indexed) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.

For example, if `nums = [6,1,7,4,1]`:
Choosing to remove index `1` results in `nums = [6,7,4,1]`.

Choosing to remove index `2` results in `nums = [6,1,4,1]`.

Choosing to remove index `4` results in `nums = [6,1,7,4]`.

An array is fair if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.

Return the number of indices that you could choose such that after the removal, `nums` is fair. 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,6,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Remove index 0: [1,6,4] -> Even sum: 1 + 4 = 5. Odd sum: 6. Not fair.

Remove index 1: [2,6,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 6. Fair.

Remove index 2: [2,1,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.

Remove index 3: [2,1,6] -> Even sum: 2 + 6 = 8. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.

There is 1 index that you can remove to make nums fair.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can remove any index and the remaining array is fair.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot make a fair array after removing any index.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to determine how many indices we can remove from the given array such that the remaining elements form a "fair" array. An array is considered "fair" when the sum of the elements at even indices is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices.

### Steps to Approach the Problem

1. **Understand the Sums**:
   - First, compute the total sum of elements at even indices and the total sum of elements at odd indices for the entire array. Let's denote these as `even_total` and `odd_total`.

2. **Iterate Through Indices**:
   - For each index, calculate what will happen if we remove that index:
     - If the index is even:
       - The new `even_sum` after removal will be `even_total - nums[i]`.
       - The `odd_sum` remains `odd_total`.
     - If the index is odd:
       - The new `odd_sum` after removal will be `odd_total - nums[i]`.
       - The `even_sum` remains `even_total`.

3. **Calculate Fairness**:
   - For each index, check if the adjusted sums after removal are equal. If they are equal, it means that removing this index results in a fair array.

### Efficient Approach
Instead of recalculating the sums for every possible index, we keep track of the running totals as we iterate through the array. This way, we can efficiently determine the sums for the array when an index is removed.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def countWays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Total sums for even and odd indexed positions
        even_total = sum(nums[i] for i in range(0, n, 2))
        odd_total = sum(nums[i] for i in range(1, n, 2))
        
        # This will hold the number of ways to make the array fair
        fair_count = 0
        
        # Current cumulative sums before index i removal
        current_even_sum = 0
        current_odd_sum = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # i is even
                # Calculate potential new even and odd sums
                new_even_sum = even_total - nums[i] - current_even_sum
                new_odd_sum = odd_total - current_odd_sum
                
            else:  # i is odd
                new_even_sum = even_total - current_even_sum
                new_odd_sum = odd_total - nums[i] - current_odd_sum
            
            # Check if they are equal
            if new_even_sum == new_odd_sum:
                fair_count += 1
            
            # Update current sums for the next iteration
            if i % 2 == 0:
                current_even_sum += nums[i]
            else:
                current_odd_sum += nums[i]
        
        return fair_count

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the total sums of even and odd indexed elements.
2. **Loop Through Each Index**: For each index, we check if its removal results in the remaining array being fair.
3. **Updating Sums**: As we process each index, we update the cumulative sums used to check fairness in future iterations.
4. **Return Count**: Finally, we return the count of indices that can be removed to achieve a fair array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array, as we are only iterating through the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

This solution is optimal and efficient given the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array

### Problem Description 
You may recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:
`arr.length >= 3`
There exists some index `i` (0-indexed) with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
	
`arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
`arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`
Given an integer array `nums`​​​, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make `nums​​​` a mountain array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array itself is a mountain array so we do not need to remove any elements.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One solution is to remove the elements at indices 0, 1, and 5, making the array nums = [1,5,6,3,1].


Example 3:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,1,1,2,3,1]
Output: 4

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`3 <= nums.length <= 1000`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
It is guaranteed that you can make a mountain array out of `nums`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of transforming the given array into a mountain array with the minimum number of removals, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. Here's how we can break down the solution:

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Mountain Arrays**: A mountain array must increase to a peak and then decrease. This requires dividing the array into two parts:
   - An **increasing part** that strictly increases up to a peak.
   - A **decreasing part** that strictly decreases after the peak.

2. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**:
   - We need two arrays, `left` and `right`.
   - The `left[i]` array will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at index `i`.
   - The `right[i]` array will store the length of the longest decreasing subsequence that starts at index `i`.

3. **Filling the `left` Array**: Loop through each element and calculate how long the increasing subsequence is up to that index.

4. **Filling the `right` Array**: Loop through the array from the end to the beginning and calculate how long the decreasing subsequence is starting from that index.

5. **Calculating Removals**:
   - For a valid mountain with peak at index `i`, we can combine the lengths of the increasing and decreasing subsequences that include `i`.
   - The total elements in the potential mountain array would be `left[i] + right[i] - 1` (subtracting one because the peak index `i` is included in both subsequences).
   - The minimum removals needed would be the total number of elements minus the maximum size of the mountain array we can form.

### Implementation

Here’s the Python implementation in the LeetCode style:



```python
class Solution:
    def minimumMountainRemovals(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Edge case check
        if n < 3:
            return 0
        
        # Arrays to store longest increasing subsequence lengths from left and right
        left = [1] * n
        right = [1] * n
        
        # Fill left array for longest increasing subsequence
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    left[i] = max(left[i], left[j] + 1)
        
        # Fill right array for longest decreasing subsequence
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(n - 1, i, -1):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    right[i] = max(right[i], right[j] + 1)

        # Now calculate the maximum mountain length and the removals needed
        max_mountain_len = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if left[i] > 1 and right[i] > 1:  # ensure that it's a mountain peak
                max_mountain_len = max(max_mountain_len, left[i] + right[i] - 1)

        # The minimum removals is total elements minus the max mountain length found
        return n - max_mountain_len


```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We start by defining the `left` and `right` arrays initialized to 1 for each position since the minimum length of any subsequence is 1 (just the element itself).
  
2. **Filling the `left` array** works by checking for each element how many elements before it are smaller. We update the `left[i]` with the maximum length found.

3. **Filling the `right` array** executes similarly but in reverse, ensuring we check only future elements from each starting index.

4. **Calculating the maximum mountain length**: We go through potential peaks and only consider valid peaks where both the left and right subsequences are greater than 1.

5. **Final Calculation**: We subtract the maximum mountain length from `n` (the total number of elements) to find how many need to be removed to form a valid mountain array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) due to the nested loops used for pairing in the subsequence calculations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `left` and `right` arrays.

This code will run efficiently within the constraints provided (3 <= nums.length <= 1000).

# 1682. Longest Palindromic Subsequence II

### Problem Description 
A subsequence of a string `s` is considered a good palindromic subsequence if:
It is a subsequence of `s`.

It is a palindrome (has the same value if reversed).

It has an even length.

No two consecutive characters are equal, except the two middle ones.

For example, if `s = "abcabcabb"`, then `"abba"` is considered a good palindromic subsequence, while `"bcb"` (not even length) and `"bbbb"` (has equal consecutive characters) are not.

Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest good palindromic subsequence in `s`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "bbabab"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "baab".


Example 2:
Input: s = "dcbccacdb"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "dccd".


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 250`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest good palindromic subsequence in a given string `s`, we need to break down the requirements for a subsequence to be considered a good palindromic subsequence:

1. It must be a subsequence of `s`.
2. It must be a palindrome.
3. It must have an even length.
4. No two consecutive characters are equal, except for the two middle characters of the palindrome.

To implement a solution, we can use the following algorithm:

### Key Steps:
1. **Iterate through Pairs of Characters**: Since we need an even-length palindrome, we will consider pairs of equal characters in `s`, which will become the two middle characters of our palindrome.
2. **Expand Around the Center**: From each pair, we will try to expand outward and collect characters to form our palindromic sequence. We will ensure that each expansion maintains the conditions that no two consecutive characters are equal.
3. **Count Lengths**: For each valid expansion that forms a good palindromic subsequence, we will count its length and track the maximum length found.

### Python Code:
Here is how we can write this in Python, formatted to run on the LeetCode website.



```python
class Solution:
    def longestGoodPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        maxLength = 0
        
        # Loop to find each pair of identical characters as the center
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:  # Potential center of the palindrome
                    # Try to expand around the center (i, j)
                    left = i - 1
                    right = j + 1
                    currentLength = 2  # We have 's[i]' and 's[j]' as the center
                    
                    # Expand while conditions hold
                    while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] != s[left + 1] and s[right] != s[right - 1]:
                        if s[left] == s[right]:
                            currentLength += 2  # Extend the length of palindrome
                            left -= 1
                            right += 1
                        else:
                            break  # Break if characters are not equal
                    
                    maxLength = max(maxLength, currentLength)
        
        return maxLength

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.longestGoodPalindromicSubsequence("bbabab"))  # Output: 4
print(solution.longestGoodPalindromicSubsequence("dcbccacdb"))  # Output: 4

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by iterating through each character pair `(i, j)` for the potential centers of the palindromes. We check if the characters at these positions are the same.
- For any valid center `(i, j)` that has matching characters, we attempt to expand outwards while ensuring that no two adjacent characters are the same except for the two characters at the center. 
- As we find valid extensions for our palindrome, we accumulate the current palindrome's length and update the maximum length found.
- Finally, we return the maximum length as the answer.

This efficient approach ensures we check all potential palindromic subsequences while adhering to the constraints given by the problem statement.

# 1687. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports

### Problem Description 
You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.

You are given an array `boxes`, where `boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti]`, and three integers `portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, and `maxWeight`.

`ports​​i` is the port where you need to deliver the `ith` box and `weightsi` is the weight of the `ith` box.

`portsCount` is the number of ports.

`maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:
The ship will take some number of boxes from the `boxes` queue, not violating the `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` constraints.

For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.

The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.

So the total number of trips is 4.

Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).


Example 2:
Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.


Example 3:
Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.


Example 4:
Input: boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7
Output: 14
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips. 
- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.


Constraints:
`1 <= boxes.length <= 105`
`1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 105`
`1 <= ports​​i <= portsCount`
`1 <= weightsi <= maxWeight`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem of delivering boxes to various ports using a single ship with specific constraints, we can follow a queue-like strategy while keeping track of the current state of the ship in terms of the number of boxes and their total weight.

### Solution Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will maintain a variable `trips` to count the total number of trips made by the ship.
   - We will also keep track of the current weight of the loaded boxes and the number of boxes.

2. **Loading Boxes**:
   - We use a loop to iterate over the boxes. For each box, we try to load it onto the ship while ensuring we do not exceed the maximum weight and the maximum number of boxes.
   - If adding a box would exceed the limits, we 'make a trip' to deliver the previously loaded boxes to their respective ports, which involves calculating the trips needed based on the unique ports visited.

3. **Delivery and Return**:
   - For each unique port that we deliver to, we consider the trips as follows:
     - If the ship is already at a port for the next box, we don't need to count an extra trip.
     - If the next box requires a trip to a different port, we:
       - Count a trip to deliver the boxes.
       - Count a trip back to storage.
   - After delivering all feasible boxes, we increase the trips count and reset the current load and weights.

4. **Final Clean-Up**:
   - After loading all the deliverable boxes, if any remain at the end, we make one last trip for those.

Here’s how we can implement this in Python, formatted as per LeetCode's requirements:



```python
class Solution:
    def boxDelivering(self, boxes: list[list[int]], portsCount: int, maxBoxes: int, maxWeight: int) -> int:
        trips = 0
        n = len(boxes)
        current_weight = 0
        current_boxes = 0
        current_ports = set()
        last_port = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            current_weight = 0
            current_boxes = 0
            current_ports.clear()
            last_port = 0
            
            # Try to load boxes onto the ship until we reach limits
            while i < n and current_boxes < maxBoxes and current_weight + boxes[i][1] <= maxWeight:
                current_weight += boxes[i][1]
                current_boxes += 1
                current_ports.add(boxes[i][0])
                i += 1
            
            # Each unique port adds one trip to deliver boxes
            trips += len(current_ports) + (1 if current_ports else 0)  # +1 for returning to storage
            
        return trips

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the class `Solution` and method `boxDelivering`.
- `trips` keeps track of the total number of trips required.
- A while loop iterates through all the boxes. The inner while loop attempts to load boxes into the ship until we hit either the box limit or weight limit.
- We keep a set `current_ports` to track unique ports encountered during the loading phase. After loading, we account for trips based on the number of unique ports visited during the delivery.
- Finally, we return the total `trips`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of boxes, since each box is processed at most twice (once when considered for loading, and once for counting trips).
- Space Complexity: O(1), ignoring the input storage, as we are using a constant amount of space for counters and port tracking. 

This solution efficiently adheres to LeetCode guidelines and should perform well within given constraints.

# 1690. Stone Game VII

### Problem Description 
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to minimize the score's difference. Alice's goal is to maximize the difference in the score.

Given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone from the left, return the difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [5,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = [5,3,1,4].

- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = [3,1,4].

- Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = [1,4].

- Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [4].

- Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [].

The score difference is 18 - 12 = 6.


Example 2:
Input: stones = [7,90,5,1,100,10,10,2]
Output: 122

Constraints:
`n == stones.length`
`2 <= n <= 1000`
`1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. The goal is to maximize Alice's score while minimizing Bob's potential score at every step. This effectively means that both players are playing optimally.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Points Calculation**:
   - When a player takes an action (removes a stone), they do not get points for the stone they remove but rather points based on the sum of the remaining stones.
   - Therefore, if Alice or Bob chooses the leftmost or rightmost stone, they will want to maximize their own score while minimizing their opponent's future scoring potential.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We can create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum score difference that the current player can achieve over the opponent with the stones available from index `i` to index `j`.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If there is only one stone (`i == j`), the current player will take this stone, and thus the difference will be just the value of that stone.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If the current player can either take the leftmost (`stones[i]`) or rightmost (`stones[j]`) stone, the calculation for the score difference can be formulated as:
     - Take the left stone: The score difference equals the value of this stone minus the score difference the opponent will leave them:
       \[
       dp[i][j] = stones[i] + \text{sum}(i+1, j) - dp[i+1][j]
       \]
     - Take the right stone: Similarly,
       \[
       dp[i][j] = stones[j] + \text{sum}(i, j-1) - dp[i][j-1]
       \]

   - Combining these, we have:
   \[
   dp[i][j] = \max(stones[i] + \text{sum}(i + 1, j) - dp[i + 1][j], stones[j] + \text{sum}(i, j - 1) - dp[i][j - 1])
   \]

5. **Full Implementation**:
   - Sum can be pre-computed for efficiency, and then we can fill in our DP table based on the above logic.

Here's how the solution can be implemented in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGameVIII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(stones)
        
        # Precompute the prefix sums
        prefix_sum = [0] * n
        prefix_sum[0] = stones[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + stones[i]

        # Initialize the dp array
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[n - 1] = prefix_sum[n - 1]  # Only one stone left for Alice

        # Fill the dp array from back to front
        max_diff = dp[n - 1]  # This is the maximum score Alice can get when she takes the last stone
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            # recalculate dp[i]
            dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], prefix_sum[i] - dp[i + 1])
            max_diff = max(max_diff, dp[i])

        return max_diff

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of all stones up to the index `i` to make the sum retrieval efficient.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: We initialize the `dp` array and pre-fill the last element based on the prefix sum since it represents the scenario where only one stone remains.

3. **Updating Scores**: As we fill the DP array from the back to front, we calculate the maximum score difference each player can achieve in each state.

4. **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum score difference that Alice can achieve when both play optimally.

This method ensures optimal time complexity is maintained while adhering to the constraints given in the problem.

# 1691. Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids

### Problem Description 
Given `n` `cuboids` where the dimensions of the `ith` cuboid is `cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti]` (0-indexed). Choose a subset of `cuboids` and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid `i` on cuboid `j` if `widthi <= widthj` and `lengthi <= lengthj` and `heighti <= heightj`. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.

Return the maximum height of the stacked `cuboids`.


Example 1:
Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
Output: 190
Explanation:
Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.

Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.

Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.

The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.


Example 2:
Input: cuboids = [[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]
Output: 76
Explanation:
You can't place any of the cuboids on the other.

We choose cuboid 1 and rotate it so that the 35x3 side is facing down and its height is 76.


Example 3:
Input: cuboids = [[7,11,17],[7,17,11],[11,7,17],[11,17,7],[17,7,11],[17,11,7]]
Output: 102
Explanation:
After rearranging the cuboids, you can see that all cuboids have the same dimension.

You can place the 11x7 side down on all cuboids so their heights are 17.

The maximum height of stacked cuboids is 6 * 17 = 102.


Constraints:
`n == cuboids.length`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= widthi, lengthi, heighti <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum height of the stacked cuboids, we can approach it as a variation of the longest increasing subsequence problem. Here's how we can structure our solution step-by-step.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to stack cuboids on top of each other, where each cuboid can be rotated. The conditions for stacking are that the base dimensions (width and length) of the cuboid being stacked must be less than or equal to those of the cuboid below it. Our goal is to find the maximum height achievable by stacking a subset of these cuboids.

2. **Normalizing Dimensions**: For each cuboid, we want to consider all possible orientations. Since the order of dimensions does not matter for comparison purposes, we can sort the dimensions of each cuboid to standardize their representation.

3. **Sorting the Cuboids**: Once all cuboids are represented in their sorted format, we sort the entire list of cuboids based on their dimensions. This allows us to efficiently check whether one cuboid can be placed on top of another by simply going through the sorted list.

4. **Dynamic Programming**: We'll use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` will hold the maximum height achievable using the first `i` cuboids with the `i`-th cuboid at the top of the stack. The height of the stack will be the height of the `i`-th cuboid plus the maximum height of any stack that ends with a cuboid that can be placed beneath it.

5. **Implementation**: We iterate through each cuboid and check all previous cuboids to update the maximum height accordingly.

Let’s put this into code following the LeetCode submission format.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def maxHeight(self, cuboids: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Normalize the cuboids by sorting their dimensions
        for i in range(len(cuboids)):
            cuboids[i].sort()
        
        # Sort the cuboids based on their dimensions
        cuboids.sort()
        
        n = len(cuboids)
        dp = [0] * n
        
        # Compute the maximum height for each cuboid being on the top
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i] = cuboids[i][2]  # Height of the current cuboid
            for j in range(i):
                # If cuboid j can be placed under cuboid i
                if (cuboids[i][0] >= cuboids[j][0] and 
                    cuboids[i][1] >= cuboids[j][1] and
                    cuboids[i][2] >= cuboids[j][2]):
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cuboids[i][2])
        
        # The result is the maximum height found
        return max(dp)

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxHeight([[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]))  # Output: 190
print(sol.maxHeight([[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]))  # Output: 76
print(sol.maxHeight([[7,11,17],[7,17,11],[11,7,17],[11,17,7],[17,7,11],[17,11,7]]))  # Output: 102

```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Normalization**: We sort each cuboid's dimensions to account for the rotations.
- **Sorting the Cuboids**: The cuboids are then sorted based on their dimensions, which allows us to compare them easily for stacking.
- **Dynamic Programming Array**: We initiate a DP array where each entry initially holds the height of the corresponding cuboid.
- **Nested Loop**: For each cuboid, we check all previous cuboids to determine if they can act as a base for the current cuboid. If they can, we update the maximum height achievable with the current cuboid on top.
- **Result Calculation**: Finally, we return the maximum value found in the DP array, which gives the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints provided and accurately gets the maximum stacking height as required.

# 1692. Count Ways to Distribute Candies

### Problem Description 
There are `n` unique candies (labeled `1` through `n`) and `k` bags. You are asked to distribute all the candies into the bags such that every bag has at least one candy.

There can be multiple ways to distribute the candies. Two ways are considered different if the candies in one bag in the first way are not all in the same bag in the second way. The order of the bags and the order of the candies within each bag do not matter.

For example, `(1), (2,3)` and `(2), (1,3)` are considered different because candies `2` and `3` in the bag `(2,3)` in the first way are not in the same bag in the second way (they are split between the bags `(2)` and `(1,3)`). However, `(1), (2,3)` and `(3,2), (1)` are considered the same because the candies in each bag are all in the same bags in both ways.

Given two integers, `n` and `k`, return the number of different ways to distribute the candies. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: You can distribute 3 candies into 2 bags in 3 ways:
(1), (2,3)
(1,2), (3)
(1,3), (2)

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: You can distribute 4 candies into 2 bags in 7 ways:
(1), (2,3,4)
(1,2), (3,4)
(1,3), (2,4)
(1,4), (2,3)
(1,2,3), (4)
(1,2,4), (3)
(1,3,4), (2)

Example 3:
Input: n = 20, k = 5
Output: 206085257
Explanation: You can distribute 20 candies into 5 bags in 1881780996 ways. 1881780996 modulo 109 + 7 = 206085257.


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= n <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of distributing `n` unique candies into `k` bags such that each bag has at least one candy, we can utilize a combinatorial approach known as "Stirling numbers of the second kind." The Stirling number \( S(n, k) \) counts the number of ways to partition `n` distinct objects into `k` non-empty subsets.

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind**:
   - \( S(n, k) \) gives the count of ways to divide `n` distinct items into `k` non-empty sets.
   - The recurrence relation for Stirling numbers is:
     \[
     S(n, k) = k \cdot S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)
     \]
   - The first term accounts for the scenarios where the nth item is placed into one of the `k` existing sets, and the second term accounts for the scenario where the nth item forms a new set on its own.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - \( S(n, n) = 1 \) (each candy in its own bag).
   - \( S(n, 1) = 1 \) (all candies in one bag).
   - \( S(n, 0) = 0 \) for \( n > 0 \) (no bags cannot have candies).

3. **Final Outdoor**: 
   To account for bags where the order of bags matters, the answer will be \( k! \times S(n, k) \), where \( k! \) is the number of ways to arrange `k` bags.

### Implementation:
Here is how we can implement this logic in Python, formatted to run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countWays(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Create a dp table to store Stirling numbers S(n, k)
        stirling = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Base cases initialization
        stirling[0][0] = 1  # S(0, 0) = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            stirling[i][1] = 1  # S(n, 1) = 1 for all n
            stirling[i][i] = 1  # S(n, n) = 1 for all n

        # Fill the dp table using the recurrence relation
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(2, min(i, k) + 1):
                stirling[i][j] = (j * stirling[i - 1][j] + stirling[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
        
        # Factorial calculation for k!
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            factorial = factorial * i % MOD
        
        # Result is k! * S(n, k)
        result = (factorial * stirling[n][k]) % MOD
        return result

```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k) due to the nested loops filling the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k) due to the DP table.

### Example Execution:
For example, with `n = 4` and `k = 2`, our code will compute \( S(4, 2) \) and the result will be \( 7 \) multiplied by \( 2! = 2 \), thus yielding a final result of \( 14 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

This implementation adheres to the constraints and efficiently computes the required distribution count using combinatorial principles.

# 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall

### Problem Description 
You have a 2-D `grid` of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as `1`.

A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as `-1`.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the `ith` column at the top, or `-1` if the ball gets stuck in the box.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: This example is shown in the photo.

Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.

Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.

Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.

Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.

Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: The ball gets stuck against the left wall.


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,-1]

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 100`
`grid[i][j]` is `1` or `-1`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining where each ball will fall out of the grid, we can simulate the process of dropping each ball into the box. We'll keep track of the ball's position as it moves through the grid based on the direction indicated by the values in the grid (-1 for left, 1 for right). We need to handle the cases where the ball can get stuck due to hitting walls or forming a "V" shape.

Below is the Python code that accomplishes this, following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def findBall(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        m = len(grid)  # number of rows
        n = len(grid[0])  # number of columns
        results = []

        for col in range(n):
            current_col = col
            
            for row in range(m):
                direction = grid[row][current_col]

                # If the direction is 1, the ball can go to the right
                if direction == 1:
                    if current_col == n - 1 or grid[row][current_col + 1] == -1:
                        # If the ball is at the rightmost column or the right cell has a left redirect
                        current_col = -1
                        break
                    else:
                        current_col += 1

                # If the direction is -1, the ball can go to the left
                elif direction == -1:
                    if current_col == 0 or grid[row][current_col - 1] == 1:
                        # If the ball is at the leftmost column or the left cell has a right redirect
                        current_col = -1
                        break
                    else:
                        current_col -= 1

            results.append(current_col)

        return results

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We determine the number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) in the grid. We also initialize a list called `results` that will store the final output for each ball.

2. **Dropping Each Ball**: We loop through each column from `0` to `n-1`, representing dropping a ball in that column.

3. **Tracking Ball Movement**:
   - For each row (`0` to `m-1`), we check the cell in the current column (`current_col`).
   - **Right Direction** (`1`): 
     - If the ball is at the last column, or the next cell (to the right) has a left redirect (`-1`), the ball gets stuck, and we set `current_col` to `-1`.
     - If it's safe to move to the right, we increment `current_col`.
   - **Left Direction** (`-1`):
     - If the ball is at the first column, or the next cell (to the left) has a right redirect (`1`), the ball gets stuck, and we set `current_col` to `-1`.
     - If it's safe to move left, we decrement `current_col`.

4. **Storing Results**: After processing all the rows for a particular column, we append the final column position (or `-1` if stuck) to our `results` list.

5. **Return the Output**: Finally, we return the `results` list containing where each ball exits or whether it gets stuck.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(m * n)` because we potentially process every cell in the grid for each column.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` for the output list. 

This solution efficiently simulates the ball's journey through the grid and meets the problem's constraints.

# 1724. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths II

### Problem Description 
An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where `edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with distance `disi`. Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes, and the graph may not be connected.

Implement the `DistanceLimitedPathsExist` class:
`DistanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, int[][] edgeList)` Initializes the class with an undirected graph.

`boolean query(int p, int q, int limit)` Returns `true` if there exists a path from `p` to `q` such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than `limit`, and otherwise `false`.


Example 1:
Input
["DistanceLimitedPathsExist", "query", "query", "query", "query"]
[[6, [[0, 2, 4], [0, 3, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 5]]], [2, 3, 2], [1, 3, 3], [2, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6]]
Output
[null, true, false, true, false]
Explanation
DistanceLimitedPathsExist distanceLimitedPathsExist = new DistanceLimitedPathsExist(6, [[0, 2, 4], [0, 3, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 5]]);
distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(2, 3, 2); // return true. There is an edge from 2 to 3 of distance 1, which is less than 2.

distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(1, 3, 3); // return false. There is no way to go from 1 to 3 with distances strictly less than 3.

distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(2, 0, 3); // return true. There is a way to go from 2 to 0 with distance < 3: travel from 2 to 3 to 0.

distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(0, 5, 6); // return false. There are no paths from 0 to 5.


`Constraints:`
`2 <= n <= 104`
`0 <= edgeList.length <= 104`
`edgeList[i].length == 3`
`0 <= ui, vi, p, q <= n-1`
`ui != vi`
`p != q`
`1 <= disi, limit <= 109`
At most `104` calls will be made to `query`.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can use a combination of Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) and sorting. The idea is to efficiently determine whether two nodes are connected under certain distance limits based on the edges in the graph.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We will implement the Union-Find (DSU) structure to help us keep track of which nodes are connected. This structure will support two main operations:
   - **Find**: Determine the root of a node.
   - **Union**: Connect two nodes.

2. **Initialization**: Upon initialization of our `DistanceLimitedPathsExist` class, we will store the edges and sort them based on the distances. This will allow us to process queries efficiently.

3. **Processing Queries**: For each query, we will:
   - Gradually add edges (union operations) that have distances less than the query limit.
   - Check if the two nodes from the query belong to the same connected component (i.e., have the same root).

4. **Handling Multiple Queries Efficiently**: The queries may come in any order, but because we pre-sort the edges by distance, we can ensure that we only union the edges with distances lower than the limit for each query. This minimizes redundant calculations.

### Implementation:



```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
    
    def find(self, node):  # Path compression
        if self.parent[node] != node:
            self.parent[node] = self.find(self.parent[node])
        return self.parent[node]
    
    def union(self, node1, node2):  # Union by rank
        root1 = self.find(node1)
        root2 = self.find(node2)
        
        if root1 != root2:
            if self.rank[root1] > self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
            elif self.rank[root1] < self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root1] = root2
            else:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
                self.rank[root1] += 1

class DistanceLimitedPathsExist:
    def __init__(self, n: int, edgeList: List[List[int]]):
        self.uf = UnionFind(n)
        # Sort edges based on distance
        self.edgeList = sorted(edgeList, key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    def query(self, p: int, q: int, limit: int) -> bool:
        # Union the edges that have a distance less than the limit
        while self.edgeList and self.edgeList[0][2] < limit:
            u, v, dis = self.edgeList.pop(0)
            self.uf.union(u, v)
        
        # Check if p and q are connected
        return self.uf.find(p) == self.uf.find(q)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **UnionFind Class**: This class manages the find and union operations using path compression and union by rank to keep the union-find operations efficient.

2. **DistanceLimitedPathsExist Class**:
   - The constructor takes the number of nodes `n` and the list of edges `edgeList`, sorts the edges by distance, and initializes the Union-Find structure.
   
3. **Query Method**:
   - For each query, we first union all edges that have a distance less than the `limit`.
   - After unioning, we check if the two nodes `p` and `q` have the same root representative, which indicates that a path exists between them under the given constraints.

This implementation efficiently handles multiple queries by leveraging the sorted list of edges and the Union-Find structure to dynamically manage connectivity as the queries are processed. 

### Example Usage:

The solution provided can be directly copied into a LeetCode environment, and it is designed to handle inputs in the format specified in the problem statement. You can instantiate the `DistanceLimitedPathsExist` class and call the `query` method with the desired parameters to check the connectivity based on the specified distance limits.

# 1728. Cat and Mouse II

### Problem Description 
A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).

Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.

Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.

Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.

There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:
Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.

During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.

`catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.

Staying in the same position is allowed.

Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:
If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.

If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.

If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.

If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = ["####F","#C...","M...."], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.


Example 2:
Input: grid = ["M.C...F"], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 4
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: grid = ["M.C...F"], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 3
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: grid = ["C...#","...#F","....#","M...."], catJump = 2, mouseJump = 5
Output: false

Example 5:
Input: grid = [".M...","..#..","#..#.","C#.#.","...#F"], catJump = 3, mouseJump = 1
Output: true

Constraints:
`rows == grid.length`
`cols = grid[i].length`
`1 <= rows, cols <= 8`
`grid[i][j]` consist only of characters `'C'`, `'M'`, `'F'`, `'.'`, and `'#'`.

There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.

`1 <= catJump, mouseJump <= 8`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if the mouse can win the game against the cat in the given grid, we need an approach that considers the positions of both players, the food's position, and the distances they can cover. The players alternate turns, and the mouse has various options to evade the cat while aiming for the food.

The solution involves a depth-first search (DFS) approach combined with memoization to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency. We'll define states for the game and recursively determine the outcome based on the moves available to the mouse and the cat.

Here's the step-by-step implementation followed by a detailed explanation:



```python
class Solution:
    def canMouseWin(self, grid: List[str], catJump: int, mouseJump: int) -> bool:
        from collections import deque
        
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Directions: (dx, dy) for up, down, left, right
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        
        # Find initial positions of Cat, Mouse, and Food
        cat_pos = mouse_pos = food_pos = None
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 'C':
                    cat_pos = (r, c)
                elif grid[r][c] == 'M':
                    mouse_pos = (r, c)
                elif grid[r][c] == 'F':
                    food_pos = (r, c)

        def canReach(start, end, jump_limit):
            """ Checks if `start` can reach `end` within the jump limit """
            queue = deque([start])
            visited = set()
            visited.add(start)

            while queue:
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                if (x, y) == end:
                    return True

                # Try all possible jumps
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    for step in range(1, jump_limit + 1):
                        nx, ny = x + dx * step, y + dy * step

                            if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                                visited.add((nx, ny))
                                queue.append((nx, ny))
                        else:
                            break  # Break on hitting a wall or out of bounds
            
            return False

        # Memoization dictionary
        memo = {}

        def dfs(mouse_x, mouse_y, cat_x, cat_y):
            # Base cases for winning conditions
            if (mouse_x, mouse_y) == (cat_x, cat_y):
                return False  # Cat catches the Mouse

            if (cat_x, cat_y) == food_pos:
                return False  # Cat reaches the Food first

            # Check memoized results
            state = (mouse_x, mouse_y, cat_x, cat_y)
            if state in memo:
                return memo[state]

            # Mouse's turn to move; it tries all possible moves
            mouse_wins = False
            for dx, dy in directions:
                for jump in range(1, mouseJump + 1):
                    new_mouse_x, new_mouse_y = mouse_x + dx * jump, mouse_y + dy * jump
                    if 0 <= new_mouse_x < rows and 0 <= new_mouse_y < cols and grid[new_mouse_x][new_mouse_y] != '#':
                        # Determine if the cat can reach the new position in its turn
                        cat_can_reach = canReach((cat_x, cat_y), (new_mouse_x, new_mouse_y), catJump)
                        if not cat_can_reach:  # If cat cannot reach the mouse move, we proceed
                            mouse_wins = mouse_wins or not dfs(new_mouse_x, new_mouse_y, cat_x, cat_y)

            memo[state] = mouse_wins
            return mouse_wins

        return dfs(mouse_pos[0], mouse_pos[1], cat_pos[0], cat_pos[1])

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Grid Initialization**: We first read the grid and locate the initial positions of the cat, mouse, and food.

2. **Helper Function (`canReach`)**: This function checks whether a player (cat or mouse) can reach a specified target position within a given jump length using a breadth-first search approach.

3. **Depth-First Search (`dfs`)**: This recursive function simulates the game:
   - It checks base cases: if the cat catches the mouse, or if the mouse or cat reaches the food first.
   - It loops through all possible moves the mouse can make, accounting for its jump length.
   - For each of mouse's potential moves, it checks if the cat can still reach that position next turn. If the mouse can make a move that the cat cannot respond to favorably, it is a potential winning move for the mouse.

4. **Memoization**: The solution uses a dictionary to store already computed states to speed up the recursive calls.

5. **Final Execution**: The `dfs` function is called with the initial positions of the mouse and cat, and it will eventually return whether the mouse can win based on optimal plays.

This structured approach effectively simulates the dynamics of the game, account for optimal strategies employed by both participants.

# 1745. Palindrome Partitioning IV

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is possible to split the string `s` into three non-empty palindromic substrings. Otherwise, return `false`.​​​​​
A string is said to be palindrome if it the same string when reversed.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abcbdd"
Output: true
Explanation: "abcbdd" = "a" + "bcb" + "dd", and all three substrings are palindromes.


Example 2:
Input: s = "bcbddxy"
Output: false
Explanation: s cannot be split into 3 palindromes.


Constraints:
`3 <= s.length <= 2000`
`s`​​​​​​ consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether a string can be split into three non-empty palindromic substrings, we can adopt the following approach:

1. **Definition Recap**: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Naive Brute Force Method**: The naive method would be to check every possible triplet of substrings which would lead to a time complexity of O(n^3), where `n` is the length of the string. This is inefficient for larger strings.

3. **Optimized Approach**:
   - We can optimize our solution using the concept of dynamic programming to precompute whether each substring of the input string is a palindrome.
   - We create a 2D boolean array `is_palindrome` where `is_palindrome[i][j]` will be `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
   - We then iterate through possible split points for the string to see if we can find three palindromic substrings.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Create a precomputation table to identify all palindromic substrings.
2. Use three pointers to iterate through different potential splits.
3. Check the conditions for the substrings created by the splits.

Here is the Python code implementing this plan following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def checkPartitioning(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        
        # Step 1: Create a 2D array to mark palindromes
        is_palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # All substrings of length 1 are palindromes
        for i in range(n):
            is_palindrome[i][i] = True
            
        # Check for substrings of length 2
        for i in range(n - 1):
            is_palindrome[i][i + 1] = (s[i] == s[i + 1])
        
        # Check for substrings of length greater than 2
        for length in range(3, n + 1):  # length from 3 to n
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1  # end index
                is_palindrome[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j] and is_palindrome[i + 1][j - 1])
        
        # Step 2: Check for valid partition
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                # We are checking the partitions: s[0:i], s[i:j], s[j:n]
                if is_palindrome[0][i - 1] and is_palindrome[i][j - 1] and is_palindrome[j][n - 1]:
                    return True
        
        return False

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Palindrome Checking**:
  - We initialize a 2D list `is_palindrome` where each entry `is_palindrome[i][j]` indicates if the substring `s[i:j]` is a palindrome.
  - We fill out this list for 1-character and 2-character substrings, and then use dynamic programming for longer ones.

- **Partition Checking**:
  - We use two loops. The outer loop iterates possible end indices `i` for the first substring and the inner loop iterates possible end indices `j` for the second substring.
  - For each pair (i, j), we check if `s[0:i]`, `s[i:j]`, and `s[j:n]` are palindromes using our precomputed `is_palindrome` array.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) for the palindrome checking and O(n^2) for checking partitions, resulting in an overall complexity of O(n^2).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the palindrome 2D array. 

This solution is efficient and works within the given constraints of 3 <= s.length <= 2000.

# 1746. Maximum Subarray Sum After One Operation

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums`. You must perform exactly one operation where you can replace one element `nums[i]` with `nums[i] * nums[i]`. 
Return the maximum possible subarray sum after exactly one operation. The subarray must be non-empty.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,-1,-4,-3]
Output: 17
Explanation: You can perform the operation on index 2 (0-indexed) to make nums = [2,-1,16,-3]. Now, the maximum subarray sum is 2 + -1 + 16 = 17.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can perform the operation on index 1 (0-indexed) to make nums = [1,1,1,1,-1,-1,1]. Now, the maximum subarray sum is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum possible subarray sum after replacing one element `nums[i]` with its square `nums[i] * nums[i]`, we can utilize the following approach:

### Steps to Approach:

1. **Initial Calculation**: First, we need to compute the maximum subarray sum of the original array using Kadane's Algorithm.
  
2. **Iterate Through Each Element**: For each element in the array, we simulate the replacement by calculating the new value (the square of the element) and check how this affects the surrounding subarray sums.

3. **Kadane’s Algorithm**: To find the maximum possible subarray sum efficiently, we will maintain two values: the current maximum subarray sum and the global maximum sum.

4. **Maximize Across Operations**: For each element where we perform the replacement, we need to calculate the new maximum subarray sum, keep track of the best result, and return it once the loop is complete.

5. **Final Decision**: After evaluating all possible replacements, we will return the maximum subarray sum observed.

### Implementation:

Here is how the code would look in Python, following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubarraySumAfterOneOperation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Step 1: Calculate the initial max subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_so_far = float('-inf')
        max_ending_here = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            max_ending_here += num
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
            if max_ending_here < 0:
                max_ending_here = 0
        
        # Step 2: Now we will calculate the potential improvement
        max_result = max_so_far
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Perform the operation
            new_value = nums[i] * nums[i]
            original_value = nums[i]
            
            # Step 3: Simulate the change by calculating new max subarray sums
            # We will replace nums[i] with new_value and check how it influences total
            modified_sum = 0
            total_before_replacement = 0
            total_after_replacement = 0
            
            # Calculate sum before the replacement
            for j in range(i):
                total_before_replacement += nums[j]
                modified_sum = max(modified_sum, total_before_replacement)
            
            # Add the new value and continue calculating to the right
            total_after_replacement += new_value  # Count the modified value
            modified_sum = max(modified_sum, total_before_replacement + new_value)

            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                total_after_replacement += nums[j]
                modified_sum = max(modified_sum, total_before_replacement + new_value + total_after_replacement)

            # Update the global maximum result
            max_result = max(max_result, modified_sum)
        
        return max_result

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We set up `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here` to track the current and maximum subarray sums.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This computes the maximum subarray sum for the original array by iterating through each element.

3. **Replacement Loop**: For each index, we calculate:
    - The sum before it, considering elements to the left.
    - The element would be replaced by its square, impacting the total sum.
    - The rest of the elements to the right are summed up to see how they affect the modified segment.

4. **Max Result**: After computing the potential maximums with replaced values, we select the best one.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case due to the nested sum calculations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we're using constant space, not counting the input and output. 

This should give a direct solution you can run on LeetCode by placing it within the provided class structure. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific input and output formats required by the platform.

# 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.


Example 1:
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.


Example 2:
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.

Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.


Example 3:
Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= events.length`
`1 <= k * events.length <= 106`
`1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109`
`1 <= valuei <= 106`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the total value of attending events under the constraints provided, we can utilize dynamic programming along with binary search. The crux of the solution is to maintain a way to keep track of the maximum value obtainable when attending up to `k` events, while ensuring that no two selected events overlap in terms of their dates.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Events Representation**: Each event has a start day, an end day, and a value. We need to avoid selecting overlapping events.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - We will use a dynamic programming table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value we can obtain by considering the first `i` events and attending up to `j` events.
    - Transitioning between states will involve either selecting the current event or skipping it.

3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlap**: 
    - To efficiently find the last event that does not overlap with the current event, we will sort the events by their end times and then for each event, use binary search to find the last event that finishes before the current event begins.

### Implementation

The following Python code applies the above concepts and uses the LeetCode format for submission:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, events: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        # Sort events based on end time
        events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        n = len(events)
        
        # DP table, dp[i][j] will be the max value with first i events and j events attended
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            start_day = events[i - 1][0]
            end_day = events[i - 1][1]
            value = events[i - 1][2]

            # Find the last event that does not overlap with the current one
            # Using binary search
            l, r = 0, i - 1
            while l < r:
                mid = (l + r + 1) // 2
                if events[mid - 1][1] < start_day:
                    l = mid
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
            
            # l will be the index of the last non-overlapping event
            last_non_overlap = l

            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                # Do not take the current event
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]  # Not taking the i-th event
                # Take the current event
                if last_non_overlap > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[last_non_overlap][j - 1] + value)
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], value)

        # The answer is the maximum value we can obtain by attending up to k events
        return dp[n][k]

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.maxValue([[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], 2))  # Output: 7

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Sorting the Events**: We first sort the events based on their end day to facilitate sequential processing and to properly utilize the binary search for non-overlap detection.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: A 2D list `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][j]` represents the max value obtainable from the first `i` events while attending `j` events.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: For each event:
   - If we do not select the event, the value is directly inherited from `dp[i-1][j]`.
   - If we do select the event, we add its value to the best achievable value from non-overlapping events previously considered.

4. **Binary Search**: To find the last non-overlapping event efficiently, we perform a binary search which allows us to skip directly to the relevant events rather than checking each one linearly.

5. **Final Output**: The result is obtained from `dp[n][k]`, which provides the maximum sum of values for attending up to `k` events.

This code is optimized for the given constraints and should work efficiently within the provided limits.

# 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations

### Problem Description 
You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are 1-indexed.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform exactly `m` operations. On the `ith` operation (1-indexed), you will:
Choose one integer `x` from either the start or the end of the array `nums`.

Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.

Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return the maximum score after performing `m` operations.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.

- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.

- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.

The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
Output: 102
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.

- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.

- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.

- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.

- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.


Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`m == multipliers.length`
`1 <= m <= 103`
`m <= n <= 105`` `
`-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To tackle this problem, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach. The key idea is to explore both choices we have at each step: picking from the start or the end of the `nums` array. 

### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **Definitions**:
   - Let `n` be the length of `nums` and `m` be the length of `multipliers`.
   - Define a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score we can achieve by considering the first `i` multipliers while picking `j` elements from the start of the `nums` array.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - At the beginning (when no multiplier is used), the score is 0. Therefore, `dp[0][0]` is 0 because we haven't selected any multiplier and no items from `nums`.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - At step `i`, we can either take an element from the start of `nums` (indexed by `j`) or from the end (indexed by `n - (i - j) - 1`).
   - The score for taking an element from the start will be:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + multipliers[i-1] * nums[j])
     \]
   - The score for taking an element from the end will be:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + multipliers[i-1] * nums[n - (i - j) - 1])
     \]
   - We iterate over all possible counts of picks from the start (`j`).

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final answer will be the maximum among all possible ways to pick `m` elements (0 to m from the start), which can be found in `dp[m][j]` for `j` in the range from 0 to m.

Now, let’s put this into a complete code format that can be used on LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, nums: List[int], multipliers: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        m = len(multipliers)
        
        # Create DP table
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                # Pick from the start
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + multipliers[i - 1] * nums[j - 1])
                # Pick from the end
                if j < i:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + multipliers[i - 1] * nums[n - (i - j)])
        
        # The answer is the maximum score possible after performing m operations
        return max(dp[m])


```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize a DP table with dimensions `(m + 1) x (m + 1)` to accommodate `0` to `m` operations, and `0` to `m` picks from the start.
- We then iterate through each multiplier and each possible count of picks from the start. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we calculate the maximum score possible either by taking from the start or the end.
- Finally, we return the maximum score possible at `dp[m]`, which represents performing all `m` operations.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m^2), where m is the number of multipliers since we have a nested loop based on m.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) for the DP table, as we only need the last row to compute the next one.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and will run well within the limits provided by the problem description.

# 1771. Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences

### Problem Description 
You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:
Choose some non-empty subsequence `subsequence1` from `word1`.

Choose some non-empty subsequence `subsequence2` from `word2`.

Concatenate the subsequences: `subsequence1 + subsequence2`, to make the string.

Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner. If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.


Example 1:
Input: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba", which is a palindrome.


Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which is a palindrome.


Example 3:
Input: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000`
`word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed by concatenating non-empty subsequences from two strings, we can break the solution into several steps. The strategy is to analyze the character counts in both strings and determine how they can contribute to forming a palindrome.

### Steps for the Solution:

1. **Character Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each character in both `word1` and `word2`. This helps us understand how many pairs of characters we can form.

2. **Calculate Pairs**: For each character that appears in both strings, we can form pairs of characters. Each pair contributes `2` to the palindrome length.

3. **Manage Odd Counts**: If there are characters present in one of the strings but not in the other, we can use only one instance of that character if it’s needed to form a palindrome. This means that if we have an odd count for a character, we can use one of those characters in the center of the palindrome.

4. **Build the Result**: Combine the total contributions from pairs and manage the potential for a single odd middle character.

5. **Return the Result**: If no characters can be used, return `0`.

### Python Code:



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # Count characters in both words
        count1 = Counter(word1)
        count2 = Counter(word2)

        length = 0
        odd_found = False

        # Iterate through unique characters in count1
        for char in count1:
            if char in count2:
                # Add pairs from both strings
                pairs = min(count1[char], count2[char])
                length += 2 * pairs
                
                # Check for leftover
                if count1[char] > pairs or count2[char] > pairs:
                    odd_found = True
        
        # Check characters in word1 but not in word2
        for char in count1:
            if char not in count2:
                if count1[char] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_found = True
        
        # Check characters in word2 but not in word1
        for char in count2:
            if char not in count1:
                if count2[char] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_found = True

        # If we've found an odd character, we can use one as the center
        if odd_found:
            length += 1

        return length if length > 0 else 0


```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Counter Creation**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in both `word1` and `word2`.

2. **Looping Through Characters**: We first loop through characters from `word1` and check if they exist in `word2`. If they do, we account for the minimum pairable counts by adding `2 * pairs` to our total length.

3. **Odd Count Management**: For characters that have leftover counts after accounting for pairs, we mark `odd_found = True`, indicating that we can potentially place one of those characters at the center of the palindrome.

4. **Single Odd Characters**: Remaining characters in each string that do not have a counterpart in the other string are checked for odd occurrences. If they exist and are odd, we similarly set `odd_found`.

5. **Calculating Final Length**: Finally, if any odd characters were found, we can increment the total length by `1`, as one odd character can be placed in the center of the palindrome.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively, since we go through each character count.
- The space complexity is O(1) for storing character counts, limited by the size of the alphabet (26 lowercase letters).

This solution is efficient given the constraints and effectively determines the longest palindrome length that can be constructed.

# 1786. Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node

### Problem Description 
There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight equal to `weighti`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z0, z1, z2, ..., zk]` such that `z0 = start` and `zk = end` and there is an edge between `zi` and `zi+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A restricted path is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue. `The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,3,1],[4,1,2],[7,3,4],[2,5,3],[5,6,1],[6,7,2],[7,5,3],[2,6,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue. `The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
`n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 104`
`edges[i].length == 3`
`1 <= ui, vi <= n`
`ui != vi`
`1 <= weighti <= 105`
There is at most one edge between any two nodes.

There is at least one path between any two nodes.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n` in an undirected weighted connected graph, we can break the solution down into the following steps:

1. **Graph Representation**: We'll use an adjacency list to represent the graph, as it's efficient for sparse graphs. Each edge will be represented with a dictionary or list.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: We need to calculate the shortest paths from the last node `n` to all other nodes. We will use Dijkstra's algorithm for this purpose, as it efficiently handles graphs with positive weights.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Once we have the shortest distances from node `n`, we can use a dynamic programming approach, moving from node `1` to node `n`. We'll ensure that we only count paths that satisfy the restricted condition: moving from a node with a greater distance to a node with a smaller distance.

4. **Path Counting**: We'll maintain a count of the number of ways to reach each node while adhering to the restrictions.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the output could be large, we will return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's implement this in Python:



```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countRestrictedPaths(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Step 1: Build the graph as an adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, weight in edges:
            graph[u].append((v, weight))
            graph[v].append((u, weight))

        # Step 2: Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from n to all other nodes
        def dijkstra(start):
            dist = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
            dist[start] = 0
            min_heap = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
            
            while min_heap:
                d, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                if d > dist[node]:
                    continue
                for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                    if dist[node] + weight < dist[neighbor]:
                        dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight
                        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (dist[neighbor], neighbor))
            return dist
        
        # Step 3: Get the shortest distances from node n
        distances = dijkstra(n)
        
        # Step 4: Use DP to count the restricted paths from 1 to n
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[n] = 1  # There's one way to reach n from n (stay at n)
        
        # Nodes sorted based on their distances from n (in decreasing order)
        nodes = sorted(range(1, n + 1), key=lambda x: distances[x])

        # Step 5: Process the nodes in order of their distances
        for node in nodes:
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                if distances[node] > distances[neighbor]:  # Restricted path condition
                    dp[node] = (dp[node] + dp[neighbor]) % MOD

        # The answer is the number of restricted paths from 1 to n
        return dp[1]

```

### Explanation:

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is created using a default dictionary with lists.
  
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This is implemented in the `dijkstra` function, where we maintain a minimum heap to efficiently retrieve the next node with the smallest distance.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: After computing the shortest path distances to all nodes from `n`, we employ a dynamic programming array `dp`. For each node, we traverse its neighbors and update the `dp` count for the current node based on valid restricted paths leading from neighbors.

- **Sorting Nodes**: By sorting nodes based on their distances from `n`, we ensure to process nodes that can only transition to those with smaller distances, satisfying the restriction.

In the end, we output the count of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

# 1787. Make the XOR of All Segments Equal to Zero

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `nums`​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​. The XOR of a segment `[left, right]` where `left <= right` is the `XOR` of all the elements with indices between `left` and `right`, inclusive: `nums[left] XOR nums[left+1] XOR ... XOR nums[right]`.

Return the minimum number of elements to change in the array such that the `XOR` of all segments of size `k`​​​​​​ is equal to zero.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,0,3,0], k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Modify the array from [1,2,0,3,0] to from [0,0,0,0,0].


Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,2,1,7,3,4,7], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Modify the array from [3,4,5,2,1,7,3,4,7] to [3,4,7,3,4,7,3,4,7].


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,4,1,2,5,1,2,6], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Modify the array from [1,2,4,1,2,5,1,2,6] to [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3].


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= nums.length <= 2000`
`​​​​​​0 <= nums[i] < 210`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem where we need to ensure that the XOR of all segments of size `k` is equal to zero, we can follow this approach:

### Problem Explanation

1. **Understanding XOR**: An XOR operation (`^`) has the property that if we have two numbers `a` and `b`, then `a ^ b = 0` if and only if `a = b`. Extending this, the XOR of a series of numbers will be `0` if they all contribute properly to cancel each other out.

2. **Segments of Length k**: We are asked to ensure that every segment of length `k` in the array `nums` will yield an XOR of `0`. 

3. **Approach**: We can leverage a frequency dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the segments of size `k` as we slide our window across the array. Based on these counts, we can determine how many adjustments (changes to the array elements) are necessary to make the XOR of each segment zero.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Iterate through the array**: Since we have an overlapping window scenario with segments of size `k`, we can use a dictionary to track how many times each number appears in each of the segments.

2. **Updates based on frequency**: For each segment starting from indices `0` to `n-k`, check the XOR and calculate how many numbers need to be changed to result in a zero XOR.

3. **Calculate changes needed**: For any number to appear in the segment such that the XOR can be adjusted to zero, ensure that the counted occurrences are modified or reset appropriately.

4. **Count and sum required changes**: By iterating through the segments and adjusting the counts, keep a running total of the minimum numbers changes needed.

Here is the implementation of the above approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict

        n = len(nums)
        
        # This will store the count of occurrences of numbers in the current segment
        freq = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(k)]
        result = 0
        
        # Populate frequency map for each segment position
        for i in range(n):
            freq[i % k][nums[i]] += 1
        
        # Calculate number of changes needed for each segment
        for i in range(k):
            max_freq = max(freq[i].values(), default=0)
            # To make all elements in this segment the same as the most frequent element
            result += (n // k) - max_freq
            
            # For the last segment, if n % k != 0, we have to add remaining elements
            if i < n % k:
                result += 1
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a list of dictionaries `freq` where each dictionary corresponds to one of the segments modulated by `k`.
- We populate `freq` by iterating through `nums`, counting occurrences of each number in each indexed segment.
- For each segment (indexed by `i` from `0` to `k`):
    - Determine the maximum frequency (most common number).
    - The required changes for that segment to zero out the XOR involve changing the remaining elements to the most frequent number found.
    - We keep adding up the required changes to get the final result.
  
### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We do a linear scan to set up the frequency and another linear scan to accumulate changes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k * c), where c is the number of unique elements in the input.

This solution can handle all constraints provided in the problem statement efficiently.

# 1799. Maximize Score After N Operations

### Problem Description 
You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of size `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations on this array.

In the `ith` operation (1-indexed), you will:
Choose two elements, `x` and `y`.

Receive a score of `i * gcd(x, y)`.

Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.

Return the maximum score you can receive after performing `n` operations.

The function `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 * gcd(1, 2)) = 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,4,6,8]
Output: 11
Explanation: The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 * gcd(3, 6)) + (2 * gcd(4, 8)) = 3 + 8 = 11

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 14
Explanation: The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 * gcd(1, 5)) + (2 * gcd(2, 4)) + (3 * gcd(3, 6)) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 7`
`nums.length == 2 * n`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 106`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the score from the operations defined, we can use a recursive backtracking approach. We'll explore all possible pairings of elements in the input list to calculate the score based on the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the chosen pairs.

### Problem Explanation

1. **Understanding GCD**: The Greatest Common Divisor of two integers is the largest integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. This function is essential to compute our scores during the operations.

2. **Scoring System**: For each operation `i`, we score `i * gcd(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are the two elements chosen from the array `nums`.

3. **Recursive Pairing**: Given that the size of the array is `2 * n`, we need to select pairs from the array `n` times. Each time we pick a pair, we remove those two elements from the array and reduce the problem size, aiming to maximize the score at each of these stages.

4. **Recursive Function**: We create a recursive function that tries all possible pairs of remaining elements, calculates the score for that pair, and then proceeds to the next recursive step with the remaining elements, keeping track of the total score.

5. **Backtracking**: To ensure that we consider all combinations of pairs, we will use backtracking to explore each choice fully.

### Implementation

Here’s how we can implement this in Python:



```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import gcd

class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, nums):
        n = len(nums) // 2
        
        def backtrack(mask, current_score):
            # If mask has all pairs selected (i.e., all elements are used)
            if mask == (1 << (2 * n)) - 1:
                return current_score
            
            max_score = 0
            # Count how many pairs we have already formed
            pair_number = bin(mask).count('1') // 2  # each pair needs 2 elements
            
            # Try all combinations of pairs
            for i, j in combinations(range(2 * n), 2):
                # If both indices i and j are not used
                if (mask & (1 << i)) == 0 and (mask & (1 << j)) == 0:
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << i) | (1 << j)
                    # Calculate new score with current pair
                    score = (pair_number + 1) * gcd(nums[i], nums[j])
                    # Recursively find the maximum score from the new configuration
                    max_score = max(max_score, backtrack(new_mask, current_score + score))
            
            return max_score
        
        return backtrack(0, 0)

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.maxScore([3, 4, 6, 8]))  # Output should be 11
print(solution.maxScore([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output should be 14

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Imports**: We import `combinations` from the `itertools` module to easily generate pairs and `gcd` from `math` for calculating the greatest common divisor.

2. **Class Definition**: The solution is encapsulated in a class `Solution` with the method `maxScore`.

3. **Backtracking Function**: 
   - `mask` is a bitmask representing which elements in `nums` have already been used. 
   - `current_score` keeps track of the score accumulated so far. 

4. **Base Case**: When our mask indicates all elements have been used (`mask == (1 << (2 * n)) - 1`), we return the accumulated score.

5. **Iterating Pairs**: Using `combinations(range(2 * n), 2)`, we check all possible pairs `(i, j)` of elements in `nums` that have not been used yet.

6. **Recursive Call**: For each valid pair, we calculate the new score and updated mask and make a recursive call to continue pairing the remaining numbers, while keeping track of the maximum score found.

### Complexity Considerations
- Given the constraints, this approach is feasible since `n` can be at most `7`, leading to a maximum of `14` items, which results in a manageable number of combinations for our recursive solution.

This solution encapsulates the essence of the challenge, efficiently exploring all combinations to find the optimal score.

# 1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts

### Problem Description 
There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of `batchSize`. They have a rule where they must serve all of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchSize` and an integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` denotes that there is a group of `groups[i]` customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.

When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.

You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return the maximum possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.


Example 1:
Input: batchSize = 3, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can arrange the groups as [6,2,4,5,1,3]. Then the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th groups will be happy.


Example 2:
Input: batchSize = 4, groups = [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= batchSize <= 9`
`1 <= groups.length <= 30`
`1 <= groups[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the number of happy groups of customers in a donut shop given the constraints of serving orders by batch size, we can approach the problem using a recursive backtracking approach combined with memoization. Let’s break down the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Definitions**:
    - A group of customers is happy if they can all be served fresh donuts. This means all previous donuts being served in batches should have been consumed by the time the first customer of their group is served.
    
2. **Constraints**:
    - `batchSize`: the maximum number of donuts that can be served in one batch.
    - `groups`: an array where each element represents the number of customers in a specific group.

3. **Objective**:
    - We want to maximize the number of happy groups after rearranging them.

### Approach
1. **State Representation**: 
   We can use a recursive function that tries to serve groups. The state can be represented by two factors: the remaining groups that can be served and the number of donuts left in the current batch.

2. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - At each step, try serving each group and see if they can be happy based on the current batch size.
   - If you serve a group and the number of remaining donuts in the batch after serving the group would still allow the next group to be served fresh, continue; otherwise, return back.

3. **Memoization**:
   - To avoid redundant calculations, store the results of previously computed states. This is essential given the recursive nature and overlapping subproblems typical in this type of combinatorial problem.

### Python Code
Below is the implementation of the approach described:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxHappyGroups(self, batchSize: int, groups: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import Counter
        
        # Count the number of each group size mod batch size
        group_counts = Counter(group % batchSize for group in groups)
        
        # Memoization dictionary
        memo = {}
        
        def backtrack(remainder: int, group_counts_tuple) -> int:
            # Convert group_counts to a tuple so it can be hashed (used for memo)
            if (remainder, group_counts_tuple) in memo:
                return memo[(remainder, group_counts_tuple)]
            
            max_happy = 0
            # Try every group
            for size in range(batchSize):
                if group_counts_tuple[size] > 0:
                    # Reduce the count for this 'size' group
                    new_counts = list(group_counts_tuple)
                    new_counts[size] -= 1

                    # Calculate new remainder
                    new_remainder = (remainder + size) % batchSize
                    happy_gain = 1 if new_remainder == 0 else 0
                    # Recursive call
                    max_happy = max(max_happy, happy_gain + backtrack(new_remainder, tuple(new_counts)))
                    
            # Save in memo
            memo[(remainder, group_counts_tuple)] = max_happy
            return max_happy
            
        # Start with remainder 0 and the counts of each group size
        counts_tuple = tuple(group_counts[i] for i in range(batchSize))
        # Calculate the maximum happy groups
        return backtrack(0, counts_tuple) + group_counts[0]  # add groups that can be served directly (mod == 0)

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxHappyGroups(3, [1,2,3,4,5,6])) # Output: 4
print(sol.maxHappyGroups(4, [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6])) # Output: 4

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. We use a `Counter` to group the number of customers based on their size modulo `batchSize`.
2. A recursive function `backtrack` computes the maximum number of happy groups by iterating through possible group sizes and adjusting their counts.
3. The function keeps track of the current `remainder` modulo `batchSize` and uses memoization to cache results of previously calculated states.
4. Finally, we add groups that can be directly happy (where their size % `batchSize` equals to 0) since they will always be served fresh.

This method allows us to efficiently calculate the maximum number of happy groups while adhering to the constraints provided.

# 1824. Minimum Sideway Jumps

### Problem Description 
There is a 3 lane road of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` points labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog starts at point `0` in the second lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (ranging from 0 to 3) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be at most one obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a side jump to jump to another lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the same point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Return the minimum number of side jumps the frog needs to reach any lane at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0.

Note: There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.


Example 1:
Input: obstacles = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).

Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).


Example 2:
Input: obstacles = [0,1,1,3,3,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.


Example 3:
Input: obstacles = [0,2,1,0,3,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps.


Constraints:
`obstacles.length == n + 1`
`1 <= n <= 5 * 105`
`0 <= obstacles[i] <= 3`
`obstacles[0] == obstacles[n] == 0`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of helping the frog jump to the end of the three-lane road while avoiding obstacles, we can use a greedy algorithm approach keeping track of the current lane and the necessary side jumps required to navigate through the obstacles.

### Problem Breakdown & Solution Steps

1. **Understanding the State**: The frog can be in one of three lanes (1, 2, or 3). At each point, the frog can either continue moving in the same lane if there is no obstacle or decide to make a side jump to another lane.

2. **Jump Logic**: 
   - If the current position has an obstacle on the lane the frog is in, the frog needs to jump to another lane that is not blocked.
   - We will keep track of the number of side jumps required to reach point `n` in any lane.

3. **Edge Cases**: There are no obstacles at point `0` and point `n`, which allows the frog to start and finish without any hindrance at those two points.

4. **Implementation Strategy**: We will iterate through each point from `0` to `n`, checking where obstacles are located and determining the minimum jumps required at each position.

5. **Data Structures**: We can maintain a variable to track the number of side jumps taken and some conditionals to choose lanes dynamically based on the obstacles.

### Python Code Implementation

Here’s how the implementation looks, following the LeetCode coding style:



```python
class Solution:
    def minSideJumps(self, obstacles: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(obstacles) - 1  # Length of the road
        side_jumps = 0  # Counter for the side jumps
        current_lane = 2  # Frog starts in lane 2
        
        for i in range(n):
            if obstacles[i] == current_lane:  # There's an obstacle in the current lane
                # Try to jump to lanes 1 or 3 if they are free
                if obstacles[i] != 1 and obstacles[i + 1] != 1:
                    current_lane = 1
                elif obstacles[i] != 2 and obstacles[i + 1] != 2:
                    current_lane = 2
                elif obstacles[i] != 3 and obstacles[i + 1] != 3:
                    current_lane = 3

                side_jumps += 1  # Increment the jump count
                
                # Ensure the current_lane is not obstructed by the next position
                if obstacles[i + 1] == 1 and current_lane == 1:
                    current_lane = 2  # Jump to lane 2
                elif obstacles[i + 1] == 2 and current_lane == 2:
                    current_lane = 3  # Jump to lane 3
                elif obstacles[i + 1] == 3 and current_lane == 3:
                    current_lane = 2  # Jump to lane 2

        return side_jumps

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `side_jumps` to zero and `current_lane` to 2, which is where the frog starts.

2. **Iterate through the different points**: For each point, we check if an obstacle exists in the current lane:
   - If there is an obstacle, we attempt to switch to a lane that does not have an obstacle.
   - Increase `side_jumps` each time we jump.

3. **Final Count**: The result will be the total number of side jumps required for the frog to reach the last point in any lane.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the obstacles array. We iterate through each point once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a fixed amount of extra memory for counters and lane tracking. 

This code will effectively compute the minimum number of side jumps required for the frog to reach the end of the road in a competitive programming environment or LeetCode.
