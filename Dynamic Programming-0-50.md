# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.


Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

Example 4:
Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 1000`
`s` consist of only digits and English letters (lower-case and/or upper-case),

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the longest palindromic substring in a given string `s`, we can utilize the expanding center approach. This method allows us to identify palindromic substrings efficiently by expanding from the center of potential palindromes.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Palindromes**: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "racecar" and "abba" are palindromes.

2. **Two Centers**: Each palindrome can be centered around one character (for odd-length palindromes) or between two characters (for even-length palindromes). Thus, for each character in the string, we can treat it as a potential center and expand outwards to check for palindromes.

3. **Expansion Technique**: 
   - For each index in the string, expand outward while the characters on both sides are the same. This will help to find the longest palindrome centered at that index.
   - We will maintain two cases: one for the odd-length palindrome and another for the even-length palindrome.

4. **Keeping Track of the Longest Palindrome**: During the expansion, if we find a longer palindrome than what we have recorded, we will update our longest palindrome.

### The Algorithm:

1. Define a helper function that expands around the center(s) and returns the longest palindromic substring found there.
2. Loop through each index of the string and apply the expansion function for both odd and even length centers.
3. Keep track of the longest palindromic substring and return it after iterating through all indices.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < 1:
            return ""
        
        start, end = 0, 0  # To track the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Check for odd-length palindromes
            len1 = self.expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)
            # Check for even-length palindromes
            len2 = self.expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)
            # Get the maximum length from both cases
            max_len = max(len1, len2)
            if max_len > end - start:
                # Update the start and end indices of the longest palindrome so far
                start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2
                end = i + max_len // 2
        
        return s[start:end + 1]  # Return the longest palindromic substring

    def expandAroundCenter(self, s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return right - left - 1  # Return the length of the palindrome

```

### Code Explanation:

1. **Class and Method Structure**: We encapsulate our solution within a `Solution` class and define the method `longestPalindrome` as required by LeetCode.

2. **Edge Case**: We check if the input string is empty or has a length of less than 1, in which case we return an empty string.

3. **Loop through Each Character**: We loop through each index of the string and call the `expandAroundCenter` function for both odd and even palindromes.

4. **Center Expansion**: In the `expandAroundCenter` method, we will expand as long as the characters are equal and within bounds. The length of the palindrome found is then returned.

5. **Update the Longest Palindrome**: If a longer palindrome is found during the expansions, we update the `start` and `end` indices accordingly.

6. **Final Return**: After iterating through all characters, we return the longest palindromic substring using the recorded `start` and `end` indices. 

This approach efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring and works within the constraints provided. The time complexity is O(n^2), and the space complexity is O(1).

# 10. Regular Expression Matching

### Problem Description 
Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:` `
`'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
`'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).


Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".


Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".


Example 3:
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".


Example 4:
Input: s = "aab", p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".


Example 5:
Input: s = "mississippi", p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false

Constraints:
`0 <= s.length <= 20`
`0 <= p.length <= 30`
`s` contains only lowercase English letters.

`p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.

It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of matching a string `s` against a pattern `p` that can include the special characters `'.'` and `'*'`, we'll implement a function using dynamic programming. 

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   We will use a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - We also need to handle patterns like "a*", "a*b*", etc., which can match an empty string. Therefore, we initialize the first row based on the pattern `p`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - If the current characters in `s` and `p` match or if `p[j-1]` is `'.'`, then `dp[i][j]` will depend on `dp[i-1][j-1]` (i.e., the match without the current characters).
   - If `p[j-1]` is `'*'`, we have two options:
     - We can treat `'*'` as matching zero occurrences of the preceding character: thus, `dp[i][j]` can take the value from `dp[i][j-2]`.
     - If the preceding character in `p` (i.e., `p[j-2]`) matches the current character in `s` or is a `'.'`, then `dp[i][j]` can also inherit the match from `dp[i-1][j]` (considering the '*' matches one more occurrence).

4. **Result**:
   The final result will be stored in `dp[len(s)][len(p)]`.

### Implementation in Python

Here is the code that follows the above reasoning:



```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize the DP table
        dp = [[False] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = True  # Empty string matches empty pattern
        
        # Handle patterns like a*, a*b*,..., which may match an empty string
        for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]
        
        # Fill in the DP table
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
                if p[j - 1] == s[i - 1] or p[j - 1] == '.':
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                elif p[j - 1] == '*':
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2]  # '*' matches zero occurrences
                    if p[j - 2] == s[i - 1] or p[j - 2] == '.':
                        dp[i][j] |= dp[i - 1][j]  # '*' matches one or more occurrences
        
        return dp[len(s)][len(p)]

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.isMatch("aa", "a"))         # Output: false
print(solution.isMatch("aa", "a*"))        # Output: true
print(solution.isMatch("ab", ".*"))        # Output: true
print(solution.isMatch("aab", "c*a*b"))    # Output: true
print(solution.isMatch("mississippi", "mis*is*p*.")) # Output: false

```

You can directly copy and paste this code into the LeetCode editor, and it should run successfully to solve the problem as outlined above. The code is structured into a class with the method `isMatch`, which implements the dynamic programming approach efficiently.

# 32. Longest Valid Parentheses

### Problem Description 
Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.


Example 1:
Input: s = "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".


Example 2:
Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".


Example 3:
Input: s = ""
Output: 0

Constraints:
`0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
`s[i]` is `'('`, or `')'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest valid parentheses substring, we can use a stack-based approach which allows us to track the indices of the parentheses and calculate valid lengths efficiently. The stack will help us maintain the indices of the opening parentheses and also the last invalid closing parenthesis.

### Approach

1. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of the indices of the characters. We push the index of the opening parenthesis `(` onto the stack, and for a closing parenthesis `)`, we check if there's a corresponding opening parenthesis.

2. **Tracking Last Invalid Index**: If we encounter a `)`, and the stack is empty (meaning there's no `(` to match it), we push the current index onto the stack. This index acts as a reference for the last invalid position.

3. **Calculate Lengths**:
   - When we encounter a `)`, and the stack is not empty, we pop from the stack:
     - If there's still something in the stack after popping, it indicates a valid substring between the popped index and the current index.
     - If the stack is empty after the pop, it means we've found a valid substring from the last invalid index until the current index.

4. **Keep Track of Maximum Length**: We'll keep updating the maximum length of valid substrings found during our iterations.

### Detailed Implementation

Here's how the implementation would look in Python, formatted to work directly in LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_length = 0
        stack = [-1]  # Initialize the stack with a base index for valid length calculation

        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if char == '(':
                # Push the index of the '(' onto the stack
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                # It's a closing bracket
                stack.pop()  # Pop the last opening bracket index
                if not stack:
                    # Stack is empty means the current ')' has no matching '('
                    # Push the current index as a reference for the last invalid position
                    stack.append(i)
                else:
                    # Calculate the length of valid parentheses substring
                    valid_length = i - stack[-1]  # Current index - index of last invalid ')'
                    max_length = max(max_length, valid_length)
        
        return max_length

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Class Definition**: The solution is encapsulated in a class named `Solution`, which is the standard format for LeetCode submissions.

2. **Method Signature**: The method `longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int` takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer representing the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `max_length` is initialized to keep track of the longest valid substring found.
   - `stack` is initialized with `-1`, which acts as a base for the length calculation.

4. **Iterating through String**:
   - We use `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the character `char` as we iterate over the string.
   - Depending on whether the character is `(` or `)`, we take respective actions.

5. **Calculating Valid Length**: If we pop and the stack has valid elements, we compute the valid length using the difference between the current index and the last index stored in the stack.

6. **Returning Result**: Finally, the maximum length found is returned.

### Edge Cases Handled
- If the input string is empty, the return value is simply 0.
- This code efficiently handles different configurations of parentheses while ensuring a linear time complexity \(O(n)\), making it optimal for the given constraints. 

This solution can be submitted directly to LeetCode and should work for all valid inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

# 42. Trapping Rain Water

### Problem Description 
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.


Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.


Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

Constraints:
`n == height.length`
`0 <= n <= 3 * 104`
`0 <= height[i] <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of trapping rainwater based on the elevation map defined by the heights of the bars, we can apply an efficient algorithm using two pointers. This method operates in linear time complexity O(n) and uses constant space O(1) for additional storage.

### Explanation
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The amount of water that can be trapped above each bar is determined by the height of the tallest bars to its left and right. Specifically, for each bar, we can trap water if there are taller bars on both sides.

2. **Two Pointers Technique**:
    - We will maintain two pointers (`left` and `right`), starting from the ends of the `height` array.
    - Keep track of the maximum heights encountered so far from the left (`left_max`) and from the right (`right_max`).
    - Gradually move the pointers towards each other while calculating the trapped water:
        - If `left_max` is less than `right_max`, it means we can determine how much water can be trapped above the bar at the `left` pointer, because the left boundary is the limiting factor. 
        - If `right_max` is less than or equal to `left_max`, we do the same for the `right` pointer.

3. **Calculation**:
    - Water trapped at index `i` can be calculated as `min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]` for every bar if it's greater than zero.
  
### Python Code
Here's the implementation in Python that adheres to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0
        
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
        water_trapped = 0
        
        while left < right:
            if left_max < right_max:
                left += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                water_trapped += left_max - height[left]  # Calculate trapped water at left pointer
            else:
                right -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water_trapped += right_max - height[right]  # Calculate trapped water at right pointer
        
        return water_trapped

```

### Further Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: We immediately return 0 if the list is empty since there's no water to trap.
- **Setup**: 
  - `left` starts at the beginning and `right` starts at the end of the `height` list.
  - `left_max` and `right_max` store the maximum heights found so far on the left and right sides, respectively.
- **Main Logic**: The `while` loop continues until the two pointers meet. Inside the loop:
  - Compare `left_max` and `right_max`:
    - If `left_max` is less than `right_max`, move the `left` pointer right and update `left_max`. Calculate the trapped water at that position.
    - If `right_max` is less than or equal to `left_max`, move the `right` pointer left and update `right_max`. Calculate the trapped water at that position.
- **Return Value**: Finally, return the total amount of water trapped.

This solution efficiently calculates the water trapped while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs as given in the constraints.

# 44. Wildcard Matching

### Problem Description 
Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:
`'?'` Matches any single character.

`'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).


Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".


Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.


Example 3:
Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.


Example 4:
Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: The first '*' matches the empty sequence, while the second '*' matches the substring "dce".


Example 5:
Input: s = "acdcb", p = "a*c?b"
Output: false

Constraints:
`0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
`s` contains only lowercase English letters.

`p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the wildcard pattern matching problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D table to store whether a substring of `s` up to index `i` matches a substring of `p` up to index `j`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be `True` if `s[:i]` matches `p[:j]`.
   - The size of this table will be `(len(s) + 1) x (len(p) + 1)` to account for the empty string cases.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - For filling the first row (when `s` is an empty string), we can only match if the pattern consists solely of asterisks (`'*'`).
   - For filling the first column (when the pattern is empty), it will be `True` only for the empty string case.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - We iterate through all characters of `s` and `p`.
   - If characters match (`s[i-1] == p[j-1]`) or there is a `?`, we take the value from the diagonal cell.
   - If there is a `*`, we can either:
     - Consider the `*` as matching an empty sequence (look left: `dp[i][j-1]`).
     - Consider the `*` as matching one or more characters (look up: `dp[i-1][j]`).

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - The value at `dp[len(s)][len(p)]` will indicate if the whole string `s` matches the whole pattern `p`.

Here is the implementation in Python, formatted for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize a dp table with (len(s) + 1) x (len(p) + 1)
        dp = [[False] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
        
        # Base case: Empty string and empty pattern match
        dp[0][0] = True
        
        # Fill the first row
        for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
                if p[j - 1] == s[i - 1] or p[j - 1] == '?':
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                elif p[j - 1] == '*':
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] or dp[i - 1][j]
        
        return dp[len(s)][len(p)]

# Example usage (not part of the function, just illustration):
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.isMatch("aa", "a"))  # Output: false
# print(solution.isMatch("aa", "*"))  # Output: true
# print(solution.isMatch("cb", "?a"))  # Output: false
# print(solution.isMatch("adceb", "*a*b"))  # Output: true
# print(solution.isMatch("acdcb", "a*c?b"))  # Output: false

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `isMatch` function takes `s` and `p` as inputs.
- It initializes the DP table and sets the base cases.
- The nested loops then fill in the DP table according to the rules of matching characters and handling wildcards.
- Lastly, it returns the result indicating if `s` matches `p`. 

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(m * n) and space complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input string and pattern, respectively. The solution can handle the upper limit of the constraints provided.

# 53. Maximum Subarray

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
`-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
Follow up: If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the contiguous subarray which has the largest sum, we can use Kadane's algorithm, which provides an efficient solution with O(n) time complexity. The idea behind Kadane's algorithm is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the subarray and updating the maximum sum encountered so far. 

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We will initialize two variables:
     - `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum sum we've found. We can start it with a very small number (like negative infinity) or the first element of the array.
     - `current_sum` to keep track of the sum of the current subarray. We can set this to 0 initially.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: 
   - For each element in the `nums` array:
     - Add the current element to `current_sum`.
     - Check if `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`. If it does, update `max_sum`.
     - If `current_sum` drops below zero, reset it to zero since a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future sums.
   
3. **Return the Result**: 
   - After iterating through the array, `max_sum` will hold the largest sum of any contiguous subarray.

Here’s how this translates into Python code structured to run on LeetCode.



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_sum = float('-inf')  # Smallest possible integer
        current_sum = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)  # Update max_sum if current_sum is greater
            if current_sum < 0:
                current_sum = 0  # Reset current_sum if it drops below 0
        
        return max_sum

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution`, which is the standard structure for LeetCode problems.

2. **Function Definition**: Inside the class, we define the method `maxSubArray` that accepts a list of integers `nums`.

3. **Use of `float('-inf')`**: This ensures that we can handle arrays where all numbers are negative. It initializes `max_sum` to a very low value so that any sum we find will be larger.

4. **Looping through `nums`**:
   - For each number in the list, we add it to `current_sum`.
   - We then check and potentially update `max_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` is negative, we reset it to zero because we want to start a new subarray.

5. **Returning the Maximum Subarray Sum**: Finally, we return `max_sum` which will contain the highest sum of contiguous subarray found.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) since we are only making a single pass through the array.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

This code should work well for the given constraints and problems specified in the prompt.

# 62. Unique Paths

### Problem Description 
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28

Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

Example 3:
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

Example 4:
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6

Constraints:
`1 <= m, n <= 100`
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. The robot can only move right or down, which helps simplify our approach by allowing us to build on previously computed results.

### Explanation of the Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **Grid Representation**: We will represent the grid with a 2D list (or array) `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of unique paths to reach the cell located at row `i` and column `j`.

2. **Base Case**: 
   - If we are in the first row (`dp[0][j]`), there's only one way to get to any cell in that row (which is to move right from the start). Thus, for all `j`, `dp[0][j] = 1`.
   - Similarly, if we are in the first column (`dp[i][0]`), there's only one way to get to any cell in that column (moving down from the start). Thus, for all `i`, `dp[i][0] = 1`.

3. **Transition Formula**: For any cell at position `(i, j)`, the number of unique paths to reach it can be calculated as the sum of the paths to the cell directly above it and the cell directly to the left:
   \[
   dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
   \]

4. **Final Result**: Once we fill out the `dp` table, the value at `dp[m-1][n-1]` will be our answer since it represents the number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Python Code:

Here's how we can implement this approach in Python within the format that can be run directly on the LeetCode website.



```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Create a 2D list initialized to zero
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Fill the first row and first column with 1s
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            dp[0][j] = 1
        
        # Fill in the dp grid using the transition formula
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        
        # The answer is in the bottom-right corner of the dp grid
        return dp[m-1][n-1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `uniquePaths` which takes two parameters, `m` and `n`.
- We construct a 2D list `dp` of size `m x n` initialized with zeros.
- We fill the first row and the first column with ones as previously explained.
- Then, we use nested loops to fill the `dp` table based on the transition formula.
- Finally, we return the value at `dp[m-1][n-1]`, which contains the total number of unique paths from the top-left to bottom-right of the grid.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) because we fill up an m * n grid.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the storage of the `dp` grid.

This solution will efficiently calculate the number of unique paths for the given grid dimensions.

# 63. Unique Paths II

### Problem Description 
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.


Example 1:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.

There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`m == obstacleGrid.length`
`n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 100`
`obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the unique paths for a robot in a grid with obstacles, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D list (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach the cell `(i, j)` from the start position `(0, 0)`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Initialize the DP Array**: Create a 2D array `dp` of the same dimensions as the `obstacleGrid` initialized to `0`.

2. **Set Base Cases**:
   - If the starting cell `(0, 0)` contains an obstacle (`1`), then there are `0` unique paths, so we return `0`.
   - Otherwise, initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` since there is one way to "reach" the starting point.

3. **Fill the First Row and Column**:
   - For the first row, if there are no obstacles, each cell can be reached from the cell to its left. If an obstacle is encountered, all subsequent cells in that row will have `0` paths.
   - Similarly, for the first column, each cell can be reached from the cell above it, until an obstacle is found.

4. **Fill the DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, if it contains an obstacle, we set `dp[i][j] = 0`.
   - If it’s free, we add the number of ways to get to the cell from above (`dp[i-1][j]`) and from the left (`dp[i][j-1]`).
   - This captures the fact that if there are paths leading to a cell, they can only come from the left or above.

5. **Return the Result**: The value at `dp[m-1][n-1]` (bottom-right corner) will give us the total unique paths to reach the destination.

Here's the code implementing the above algorithm in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not obstacleGrid or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        # Create a DP table
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Starting point
        dp[0][0] = 1
        
        # Fill the first row
        for j in range(1, n):
            if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0:
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]
        
        # Fill the first column
        for i in range(1, m):
            if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:
                dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]

        # Fill the rest of the dp table
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the `obstacleGrid` is empty or if the starting cell `(0, 0)` is an obstacle. If so, we return `0`.
- We initialize a `dp` array to keep track of the number of unique paths to each cell.
- We populate the first row and first column of the `dp` array based on the presence of obstacles.
- We then use nested loops to compute the number of unique paths for each remaining cell in the `dp` array.
- Finally, we return the value in the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the total unique paths to reach that cell from the top-left corner. 

This solution is efficient and works within the problem constraints, yielding results in `O(m*n)` time and space complexity.

# 64. Minimum Path Sum

### Problem Description 
Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 200`
`0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid that minimizes the sum of all numbers along that path, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to maintain a DP table where each entry represents the minimum path sum to that cell from the top-left corner.

Here's the step-by-step explanation along with the corresponding Python code that can be directly run on LeetCode:

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Grid Definition**: The input is a 2D list `grid` where `grid[i][j]` represents the value of a cell in the grid.

2. **DP Table**: We will create a DP table `dp` with the same dimensions as the grid. `dp[i][j]` will hold the minimum path sum to reach the cell `(i, j)`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The starting point `dp[0][0]` is initialized to `grid[0][0]` because that is the first cell we start from.
   - Fill the first row and first column of the DP table since there is only one way to reach those cells (either from the left for the first row or from above for the first column).

4. **Filling the DP Table**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid (starting from `(1, 1)`):
   - The minimum path sum to `dp[i][j]` can be calculated as:
     - `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
   - This means that to reach the cell `(i, j)`, you would come from either the cell directly above it `(i-1, j)` or the cell directly to the left `(i, j-1)`.

5. **Result**: The desired minimum path sum will be in `dp[m-1][n-1]`, which is the bottom-right corner of the DP table.

Here's the complete Python code for the solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Initialize the starting point
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        
        # Fill the first row
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
        
        # Fill the first column
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
        
        # Fill the rest of the dp table
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        
        # The bottom-right corner contains the minimum path sum
        return dp[m-1][n-1]

```

# 70. Climbing Stairs

### Problem Description 
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 45`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting distinct ways to climb a staircase when each time you can either take a single step or a double step, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The problem closely resembles the Fibonacci sequence.

## Explanation:

When you are at the `n`th step, you could have arrived there in one of two ways:
1. From the `(n-1)`th step by taking a single step.
2. From the `(n-2)`th step by taking two steps.

Thus, the total number of ways to reach the `n`th step can be expressed as:
\[ \text{ways}(n) = \text{ways}(n-1) + \text{ways}(n-2) \]

We know the base cases:
- If `n = 1`, there is `1` way to reach the top (only one single step).
- If `n = 2`, there are `2` ways to reach the top (either `1 + 1` or `2`).

Based on this recurrence relation, we can build our solution using dynamic programming to avoid recalculating values.

### Implementation in Python:

Below is the implementation following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Base cases
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2
        
        # Initialize two variables to store the ways to climb to previous two steps
        first = 1  # ways to climb to step 1
        second = 2  # ways to climb to step 2
        
        # Start from step 3 and calculate all the way up to n
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            current = first + second  # the current number of ways is the sum of the two previous ones
            first = second  # move the previous values one step up
            second = current
        
        return second  # the number of ways to reach the nth step

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` which contains the method `climbStairs` that accepts an integer `n`.

2. **Base Cases**: We check if `n` is `1` or `2` and return `1` or `2` respectively, since these are easy to compute.

3. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `first` is initialized to `1`, representing the number of ways to climb to the first step.
   - `second` is initialized to `2`, representing the number of ways to climb to the second step.

4. **Looping Through Steps**: We loop from `3` to `n`:
   - For each step `i`, we calculate `current` which is the total number of ways to reach that step by summing the two previous steps (`first` and `second`).
   - We then update `first` and `second` to move one step up in the sequence.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, we return `second`, which contains the total number of distinct ways to reach the `n`th step.

This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\), which makes it efficient for the given constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).

# 72. Edit Distance

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

Constraints:
`0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
`word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another, we can use dynamic programming. This problem is commonly referred to as the "Edit Distance" problem.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   We create a 2D table (2D list in Python) where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to the first `j` characters of `word2`.

2. **Base Case Initialization**:
   - If `word1` is empty (i.e., `i=0`), we need `j` operations (insert all characters of `word2`).
   - If `word2` is empty (i.e., `j=0`), we need `i` operations (delete all characters of `word1`).

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   For each character in `word1` and `word2`, we can decide:
   - If they are the same, we can take the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If they are different, we take the minimum between:
     - `dp[i-1][j] + 1` (delete a character from `word1`)
     - `dp[i][j-1] + 1` (insert a character into `word1`)
     - `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` (replace a character in `word1` with one from `word2`)

4. **Final Result**:
   The result will be stored in `dp[len(word1)][len(word2)]`, which gives the minimum operations required to transform `word1` into `word2`.

### Python Code

Here is the complete implementation of the above logic in Python formatted to be used on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # Lengths of the two words
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)

        # Create a 2D DP array with (m+1) x (n+1)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        # Initialize the first row and first column of the DP array
        for i in range(m + 1):
            dp[i][0] = i  # Deleting all characters from word1
        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp[0][j] = j  # Inserting all characters to word1 to match word2

        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]  # Characters match
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1,    # Delete
                                   dp[i][j - 1] + 1,    # Insert
                                   dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1) # Replace

        # The answer is in the bottom-right cell
        return dp[m][n]

```

### Explanation of Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `minDistance`. 
- We calculate the lengths of `word1` and `word2`.
- We initialize a 2D list `dp` to hold our dynamic programming values.
- We populate the base cases where we either delete or insert characters.
- We loop through each character of both strings, updating our `dp` table based on the explained conditions.
- Finally, we return the minimum edit distance from the bottom-right corner of the table.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the `dp` table.

# 85. Maximal Rectangle

### Problem Description 
Given a `rows x cols` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and return its area.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.


Example 2:
Input: matrix = []
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0

Example 4:
Input: matrix = [["1"]]
Output: 1

Example 5:
Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`rows == matrix.length`
`cols == matrix[i].length`
`0 <= row, cols <= 200`
`matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the largest rectangle of '1's in a binary matrix, we can leverage the concept of treating each row of the matrix as a histogram. The idea is to compute the height of '1's for each column as we progress through each row, and then use a stack-based approach to find the maximum rectangular area in this histogram.

Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

### Explanation:

1. **Matrix Representation**: Each row of the matrix can be thought of as the base of a histogram where the height of each column increases if we encounter '1's and resets to '0' when we see a '0'.

2. **Height Computation**: For each cell in the matrix, if the cell contains '1', we increase the height for that column. If it contains '0', we reset the height for that column to '0'.

3. **Max Area in Histogram**: For each updated height of the histogram, we need to calculate the maximum rectangular area that can be formed using that histogram. This can be efficiently computed using a stack:
   - Maintain a stack to keep track of indices of the histogram bars.
   - For each bar, if it's lower than the bar represented by the index on the top of the stack, compute the area considering the bar at the top as the height of the rectangle, and pop from the stack until the current bar is higher.

4. **Iterate through Rows**: Repeat the above process for each row while updating the heights and calculate the maximum rectangle area found.

### Python Code:

Here's the implementation of the above logic in Python according to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix):
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0
        
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])
        heights = [0] * cols
        max_area = 0
        
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                # Update the heights array
                if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                    heights[j] += 1
                else:
                    heights[j] = 0
            
            # Calculate max area for current row heights
            max_area = max(max_area, self.largestRectangleArea(heights))
        
        return max_area
    
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights):
        # Add a zero height at the end to ensure we can clear the stack at the end
        heights.append(0)
        stack = []
        max_area = 0
        
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]:
                h = heights[stack.pop()]  # Height of the rectangle
                w = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1  # Width of the rectangle
                max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
            stack.append(i)
        
        heights.pop()  # Remove the added zero height
        return max_area

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Input Check**: We first check if the matrix is empty. If it is, we return `0` as there can be no rectangle.
  
- **Heights Initialization**: We create a heights array to track the heights of the columns.

- **Updating Heights**: For each row, heights are updated based on whether the current cell is '1' or '0'.

- **Calculating Max Area**: After updating the heights from the matrix row, we invoke the `largestRectangleArea` function that calculates the maximum area for the current heights using a stack to find the rectangle areas efficiently.

- **Return Max Area**: Finally, we return the maximum area found among all rows.

### Test Cases:

The code provided can handle all the mentioned test cases effectively, and it adheres to the constraints given in the problem statement.

# 87. Scramble String

### Problem Description 
We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:
If the length of the string is 1, stop.

If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.

Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.

Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
"great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.

"gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.

"gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at ranom index each of them.

"g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.

"r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".

"r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.

The algorithm stops now and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.

As there is one possible scenario that led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.


Example 2:
Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "a"
Output: true

Constraints:
`s1.length == s2.length`
`1 <= s1.length <= 30`
`s1` and `s2` consist of lower-case English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if one string is a scrambled version of another string, we can use recursion combined with memoization (to cache results of previously computed states). This approach allows us to effectively manage the overlapping subproblems inherent in the scrambled string problem.

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Base Cases**:
    - If two strings are identical, they are trivially scrambles of each other.
    - If they have different character counts (i.e., one string can't form the other), they cannot be scrambles.

2. **Recursive Case**:
    - For split index `i`, we can explore two main scenarios for the substrings `s1 = x + y` and `s2 = y + x` (indicating swapping):
        - Without swapping: Check if the first part (x) of `s1` and `s2` are scrambles and do the same for the second part (y).
        - With swapping: Check if the first part (x) of `s1` is a scramble of the second part (y) of `s2` and vice-versa.

3. **Memoization**:
    - We store previously computed results using a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations, which optimizes performance especially for larger strings.

### Python Code Implementation:

Here’s how we can implement this logic in Python, which can be directly run on the LeetCode platform:



```python
class Solution:
    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) != len(s2):
            return False
        
        if s1 == s2:
            return True
        
        # Cache to store previously calculated results
        memo = {}
        
        def helper(x: str, y: str) -> bool:
            if (x, y) in memo:
                return memo[(x, y)]
            
            if sorted(x) != sorted(y):  # Early pruning if the sorted characters don't match
                memo[(x, y)] = False
                return False
            
            n = len(x)
            for i in range(1, n):  # Split the string at index i
                # Check without swapping
                if (helper(x[:i], y[:i]) and helper(x[i:], y[i:])):
                    memo[(x, y)] = True
                    return True
                # Check with swapping
                if (helper(x[:i], y[-i:]) and helper(x[i:], y[:-i])):
                    memo[(x, y)] = True
                    return True
            
            memo[(x, y)] = False  # No valid scramble found
            return False
            
        return helper(s1, s2)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We define a function `isScramble` which sets everything up and then calls a helper function `helper`.
- The helper function checks:
    - If the lengths match and if they are identical.
    - Whether the sorted versions of the strings are the same.
    - It then iteratively splits the strings at every possible index and checks both conditions (swap and no swap).
- The use of `memo` ensures that we do not recompute results for the same pair of substrings, enhancing efficiency.

### Note on Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^4) in the worst case because there are O(n^2) pairs of substrings to check, and for each pair, you can take O(n) operations for sorting. The space complexity is O(n^2) due to storage for memoization.

# 91. Decode Ways

### Problem Description 
A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...

'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106"` can be mapped into:
`"AAJF"` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
`"KJF"` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`
Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6"` is different from `"06"`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


Example 1:
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).


Example 2:
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).


Example 3:
Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.

The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.

Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.


Example 4:
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 100`
`s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of decoding a string of digits into possible letter combinations based on a specified mapping, we can utilize dynamic programming. The core idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, building on the results of previous calculations for an efficient solution.

### Janitorial Understanding:
1. Each digit or group of digits can represent a letter from 'A' to 'Z':
   - '1' -> 'A'
   - '2' -> 'B'
   - ...
   - '26' -> 'Z'
   
2. We want to calculate how many ways we can decode a string of digits.

### Key Points:
- If a string starts with '0', it cannot be decoded (e.g., "0" or "06").
- Valid mappings using one digit include '1' to '9'.
- Valid mappings using two digits must be between '10' and '26'.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. Use a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.
2. Initialize `dp[0] = 1` (an empty string can be decoded in one way).
3. Check for single digit valid mappings (except '0').
4. Check if the last two digits form a valid two-digit mapping (from '10' to '26').

### Final Solution:
Here’s the complete code following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s or s[0] == '0':
            return 0
        
        n = len(s)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1  # There is one way to decode an empty string

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Single digit decoding
            if s[i - 1] != '0':
                dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
                
            # Two digit decoding
            if i >= 2 and '10' <= s[i - 2:i] <= '26':
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2]

        return dp[n]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the string is empty or starts with '0', return 0.
   
2. **DP Array Initialization**: 
   - Create an array `dp` with a size of `n + 1` (to accommodate decoding the entire string).
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 as there's one way (the empty string).
   
3. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character at position `i`, check if it can be decoded as a single digit (adding `dp[i-1]` if valid).
   - Check the previous two characters to see if they form a valid two-digit number (from '10' to '26') and add `dp[i-2]` if it is valid.
   
4. **Return the Result**: 
   - Finally, return `dp[n]`, which contains the number of ways to decode the entire string.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `dp` array.

This solution efficiently counts the number of decoding ways while adhering to the constraints provided.

# 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return all the structurally unique BST's (binary search trees), which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`. Return the answer in any order.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: [[1,null,2,null,3],[1,null,3,2],[2,1,3],[3,1,null,null,2],[3,2,null,1]]

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: [[1]]

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 8`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of generating all structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) for a given integer `n`, we can use a recursive approach combined with the concept of generating each tree based on different root values.

### Approach:

1. **Understanding BST Structure**:
   - Each value from `1` to `n` can serve as a root for the BST.
   - For each root, the values smaller than the root will form the left subtree, and the values larger will form the right subtree.

2. **Recursive Tree Construction**:
   - For a given root `i`, we can split our range into:
     - Left subtree containing values from `1` to `i-1`
     - Right subtree containing values from `i+1` to `n`
   - We will recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees for each root.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When there are no nodes to place (i.e., the range is empty), return [None] as the only valid tree.
   - When there's one node, return the node itself.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - For each root, iterate through all possible left and right subtrees, and combine them to create the whole tree structure.

5. **Tree Representation**:
   - We'll represent each tree as a list. The format will depict the tree level by level (using `null` for absent nodes).

### Implementation:

Here's the implementation based on the above reasoning.



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def generateTrees(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    def generate_trees(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return [None]
        
        all_trees = []
        for i in range(start, end + 1):
            # Generate all possible left and right subtrees
            left_trees = generate_trees(start, i - 1)
            right_trees = generate_trees(i + 1, end)
            
            # Combine left and right trees with the root i
            for left in left_trees:
                for right in right_trees:
                    root = TreeNode(i)
                    root.left = left
                    root.right = right
                    all_trees.append(root)
        
        return all_trees

    return generate_trees(1, n)

# This method converts the binary tree into a list representation (level order)
def tree_to_list(root):
    if not root:
        return [None]
    
    result, queue = [], [root]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node:
            result.append(node.val)
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
        else:
            result.append(None)
    
    # Remove trailing None values for cleaner output
    while result and result[-1] is None:
        result.pop()
    
    return result

# You can create a function to run the test cases as well
def all_bst(n):
    trees = generateTrees(n)
    return [tree_to_list(tree) for tree in trees]

# Example Usage:
# To get the output in LeetCode format, you can un-comment the following lines:
# print(all_bst(3))  # Output: [[1,null,2,null,3],[1,null,3,2],[2,1,3],[3,1,null,null,2],[3,2,null,1]]
# print(all_bst(1))  # Output: [[1]]

```

### Explanation:

- We define a `TreeNode` class to represent the structure of a binary tree node.
- In the `generateTrees` function, we define a helper function `generate_trees` that recursively generates all valid trees for given start and end values.
- The `tree_to_list` function converts the tree structure into a list representation suitable for output verification.
- Finally, the `all_bst` function facilitates generating the list of all BSTs in a LeetCode compliant format.

This approach ensures all unique BSTs for the input value `n` are generated and returned as required by the problem statement.

# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 19`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) that can be formed with `n` nodes, we can leverage a combinatorial approach known as the Catalan number. The number of unique BSTs possible with `n` nodes can be calculated using dynamic programming.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding BST properties**:
   For a given node `i` (where `1 <= i <= n`), we can make `i` the root of the BST. All nodes with values less than `i` will be in the left subtree, and all nodes with values greater than `i` will be in the right subtree.

2. **Subtree counts**:
   If we choose `i` as the root, the left subtree will have `i-1` nodes and the right subtree will have `n-i` nodes. Thus, the total number of unique BSTs with `i` as the root is the product of the number of unique BSTs possible for the left subtree and the right subtree.

3. **Recursion and Dynamic Programming**:
   We can create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes. The value can be computed as:
   \[
   dp[n] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} dp[i-1] \times dp[n-i]
   \]
   Here, `dp[i-1]` is the number of unique BSTs in the left subtree, and `dp[n-i]` is the number of unique BSTs in the right subtree.

4. **Base case**:
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one unique BST that can be formed with 0 nodes (an empty tree).
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is one unique BST that can be formed with 1 node.

5. **Implementation**:
   We will implement the above logic in a function that takes `n` as input and returns the count of unique BSTs.

### Python Code:



```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        # dp[i] will store the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with i nodes
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Base cases
        dp[0] = 1  # There is one unique BST for 0 nodes (empty tree)
        dp[1] = 1  # There is one unique BST for 1 node
        
        # Fill the dp array
        for nodes in range(2, n + 1):
            for root in range(1, nodes + 1):
                # Number of unique BSTs with `nodes` nodes with 'root' as the root
                left_trees = dp[root - 1]    # number of unique BSTs in the left subtree
                right_trees = dp[nodes - root]  # number of unique BSTs in the right subtree
                dp[nodes] += left_trees * right_trees
        
        return dp[n]

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.numTrees(3))  # Output: 5

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. We define a class `Solution` with a method `numTrees`. This method initializes a list `dp` where the index represents the number of nodes.
2. We set the base cases for `0` and `1` nodes.
3. We use nested loops:
   - The outer loop iterates from `2` to `n` (representing the number of nodes).
   - The inner loop iterates through each possible root value.
   - For each root, we calculate the number of unique BSTs that can be formed based on the left and right subtrees.
4. Finally, we return the value in `dp[n]`, which contains the count of unique BSTs for `n` nodes.

This solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and uses \(O(n)\) space, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 19\).

# 97. Interleaving String

### Problem Description 
Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

An interleaving of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:
`s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
`t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
`|n - m| <= 1`
The interleaving is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`
Note: `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true

Constraints:
`0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
`0 <= s3.length <= 200`
`s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

Follow up: Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether string `s3` is formed by interleaving strings `s1` and `s2`, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to use a 2D boolean array to keep track of whether a certain prefix of `s3` can be formed by interleaving prefixes of `s1` and `s2`.

### Explanation:
1. **Dimensions of the DP Table:** We'll create a DP table `dp` with dimensions (`len(s1)+1`) x (`len(s2)+1`). The entry `dp[i][j]` will be `True` if the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can form the first `i+j` characters of `s3`.

2. **Base Case:** The empty strings can interleave to form an empty string, hence `dp[0][0] = True`.

3. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - For each position `i` in `s1` and `j` in `s2`, we check the following:
     - If `s1[i-1]` matches `s3[i+j-1]`, then we can consider using the character from `s1`. Thus, if `dp[i-1][j]` is `True`, we set `dp[i][j]` to `True`.
     - If `s2[j-1]` matches `s3[i+j-1]`, then we check if `dp[i][j-1]` is `True`. If so, we also set `dp[i][j]` to `True`.

4. **Final Decision:** After filling the DP table, the value at `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]` will tell us whether `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.

5. **Space Optimization:** Since we only ever look at the current and the previous row of the DP table, we could optimize the space complexity to `O(s2.length)` by using a one-dimensional array to represent only the current row.

Here's how the implementation looks in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:
        # Check if lengths are compatible
        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
            return False
        
        # Initialize a DP table with one extra space for the empty string
        dp = [False] * (len(s2) + 1)
        
        # Base case: both s1 and s2 are empty
        dp[0] = True
        
        # Fill the first row based on s2
        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
            dp[j] = dp[j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
            # Update the first entry for the current row
            dp[0] = dp[0] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1]
            for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                dp[j] = (dp[j] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) or (dp[j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1])
        
        return dp[len(s2)]

```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we use a single row of the DP table representing previous states.

# 115. Distinct Subsequences

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.


Example 1:
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.

`rabbbit`
`rabbbit`
`rabbbit`

Example 2:
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.

`babgbag`
`babgbag`
`babgbag`
`babgbag`
`babgbag`

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
`s` and `t` consist of English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting distinct subsequences of string `s` that equal string `t`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. This technique allows us to construct a solution based on previously solved subproblems, which is efficient and manageable given the constraints of the problem.

### Approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`):**
   - We'll create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The first row `dp[0][0]` should be initialized to `1` since an empty string can form an empty string in one way (by selecting none of its characters).
   - The first column, `dp[i][0]`, should all be initialized to `1` because any prefix of `s` can form an empty string by deleting all characters.

3. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - For each character of `s` and `t`, we can update our DP table:
     - If the characters match (i.e., `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`), then:
       - We can form `t` by considering or ignoring the current character from `s`. Therefore:
       
```
       dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
       
```
     - If the characters do not match, we can only ignore the character in `s`:
       
```
       dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
       
```

4. **Result Extraction:**
   - The final answer will reside in `dp[len(s)][len(t)]`, which holds the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that form `t`.

### Python Code:

Below is the completed solution as specified in the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        # Length of the input strings
        n, m = len(s), len(t)
        
        # dp table initialization
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Base case: an empty t can be formed by any prefix of s
        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = 1  # There's one way to form an empty string
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:  # If characters match
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]
                else:  # If characters do not match
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

        # The answer is found in the cell dp[n][m]
        return dp[n][m]

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.numDistinct("rabbbit", "rabbit"))  # Output: 3
# print(sol.numDistinct("babgbag", "bag"))     # Output: 5

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We define a class `Solution` and a method `numDistinct` that takes two strings, `s` and `t`.
- We calculate the lengths of `s` and `t` and initialize a 2D list `dp` with zeros.
- We set up the base cases for matching empty strings.
- We use two nested loops to populate the `dp` table based on our logic derived from subsequence comparison.
- Finally, we return the value found in `dp[n][m]`, which represents the number of distinct subsequences. 

This solution runs in O(n * m) time complexity and uses O(n * m) space, which is practical given the constraints in the problem statement.

# 120. Triangle

### Problem Description 
Given a `triangle` array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.


Example 1:
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).


Example 2:
Input: triangle = [[-10]]
Output: -10

Constraints:
`1 <= triangle.length <= 200`
`triangle[0].length == 1`
`triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1`
`-104 <= triangle[i][j] <= 104`
Follow up: Could you do this using only `O(n)` extra space, where `n` is the total number of rows in the triangle?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum path sum in a triangle from top to bottom, we can utilize dynamic programming. The idea is to start from the second last row of the triangle and work our way up to the top, updating the minimum path sums as we go. 

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will modify the triangle itself to store the minimum path sums from the bottom to the current position.
   - Starting from the second last row to the top, we will update each element to be the sum of its own value and the minimum of the values directly below it.

2. **Space Optimization**:
   - The problem states that we can solve this using O(n) extra space. We can achieve this by modifying the triangle in-place instead of using an extra array for tracking the minimum path sums.

3. **Steps**:
   - Start from the second last row of the triangle.
   - For each element in that row, calculate the minimum path sum by adding the element's value with the minimum of the two adjacent values from the row directly below.
   - Repeat this until you reach the top of the triangle.
   - The top element of the triangle will hold the minimum path sum by the end of this process.

### Implementation

Here's the Python code according to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Start from the second last row and move upward
        for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):
            for col in range(len(triangle[row])):
                # Update the current cell with the minimum path sum
                triangle[row][col] += min(triangle[row + 1][col], triangle[row + 1][col + 1])
        
        # The top element now contains the minimum path sum
        return triangle[0][0]

```

### How to Run the Code

- Place the above code snippet in a Python code cell under the problem statement on the LeetCode website.
- Ensure that you import `List` from `typing` if it's not already included in the constraints section.
- Run the solution against any test case, such as the examples provided:



```python
# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.minPathSum([[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]))  # Output: 11
print(solution.minPathSum([[-10]]))                          # Output: -10

```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. Each element in the triangle is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) extra space is used since we are modifying the input triangle in place.

This approach efficiently computes the minimum path sum using only the triangle's own structure.

# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.


Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= prices.length <= 105`
`0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 Here’s a solution for the problem of maximizing profit from stock prices over an array of days. We'll use a single pass algorithm to achieve this efficiently.

### Approach:
To find the maximum profit, we will keep track of two variables:
1. `min_price`: This will hold the minimum stock price encountered so far as we iterate through the array. It represents the best day to buy up to that point.
2. `max_profit`: This will hold the maximum profit we can achieve, which is calculated as the difference between the current price and the `min_price`.

When iterating over the `prices` array:
- If the current `price` is lower than `min_price`, we update `min_price`.
- Otherwise, we calculate the potential profit by subtracting `min_price` from the current `price` and update `max_profit` if this potential profit is greater than the current `max_profit`.

At the end of the iteration, `max_profit` will contain the maximum profit we can achieve. If `max_profit` is less than or equal to 0, it means no profitable transaction is possible, so we will return 0.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of days (i.e., the length of the `prices` array), since we are doing a single pass through the list.

### Space Complexity:
- O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Implementation:
Here’s the Python code formatted for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # Initialize minimum price to a very high value.
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        
        # Loop through each price in the list
        for price in prices:
            # Update the minimum price encountered so far
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
                
            # Calculate potential profit
            potential_profit = price - min_price
            
            # Update the maximum profit if the potential profit is greater
            if potential_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = potential_profit
                
        return max_profit

```

### Explanation:
- We start with `min_price` set to infinity so that any price in the list will be less than it at the beginning.
- We initialize `max_profit` to zero. 
- As we go through the prices, we adjust `min_price` whenever we find a new lower price.
- For each price, we calculate the potential profit and update `max_profit` if this potential profit is the highest seen so far.
- Finally, we return the maximum profit.

This solution is straightforward and minimizes unnecessary computations, making it efficient for the input size constraints given.

# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.


Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


Example 4:
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= prices.length <= 105`
`0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum profit from stock prices with at most two transactions, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do this, followed by the complete Python code formatted for LeetCode.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Transactions**:
   Each transaction consists of a buy and a sell operation. With two transactions allowed, we can break this down into two phases:
   - The first transaction: Buy once and sell once.
   - The second transaction: Buy once (after selling the first) and sell once.

2. **Dynamic Programming Tables**:
   We will maintain two arrays:
   - `first_buy`: Maximum profit we can achieve after the first buy.
   - `first_sell`: Maximum profit we can achieve after the first sell.
   - `second_buy`: Maximum profit we can achieve after the second buy.
   - `second_sell`: Maximum profit we can achieve after the second sell.

3. **Transition Between States**:
   - For each day `i`, we will fill in these states using the prices available up to that day:
     - `first_buy = max(first_buy, -prices[i])`: Buying at the lowest price encountered.
     - `first_sell = max(first_sell, first_buy + prices[i])`: Selling at the current price after the first buy.
     - `second_buy = max(second_buy, first_sell - prices[i])`: Initiating the second transaction.
     - `second_sell = max(second_sell, second_buy + prices[i])`: Completing the second transaction.

4. **Result**:
   The maximum profit at the end of the loop will be stored in `second_sell`, as it represents the maximum profit we can achieve after completing the second transaction.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize the variables to track profits at each stage
        first_buy = float('-inf')   # Allows us to represent that we haven't bought yet
        first_sell = 0
        second_buy = float('-inf')   # Similar for second buy
        second_sell = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            # Update the profits based on the current day's price
            first_buy = max(first_buy, -price)                 # Best profit after the first buy
            first_sell = max(first_sell, first_buy + price)   # Best profit after the first sell
            second_buy = max(second_buy, first_sell - price)   # Best profit after the second buy
            second_sell = max(second_sell, second_buy + price) # Best profit after the second sell

        return second_sell  # This is the maximum profit we can achieve with at most two transactions

```

### Key notes:

1. **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the `prices` array since we are iterating through the list only once.
  
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space for our variables, regardless of the input size.

### Usage

This code can be directly run on the LeetCode platform with the suitable input array of stock prices. Just ensure that you import `List` from `typing` if not already included in the environment where you run the code.

# 131. Palindrome Partitioning

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]

Example 2:
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 16`
`s` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of partitioning a string such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome, we can utilize a backtracking approach. Let's break down the solution step by step.

### Understanding the Approach

1. **Palindrome Check**: We need a helper function to check if a given substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Backtracking**: We'll implement a recursive backtracking function that explores all possible partition points in the string `s`. When we find a valid palindrome substring, we can add it to our current partition.

3. **Base Case**: When we've processed the entire string (`start` index equals the length of `s`), we've formed a valid partition and can add it to our results.

4. **Recursive Case**: For each index `i` from the current `start` position to the end of the string, we check if the substring `s[start:i]` is a palindrome. If it is, we:
   - Add it to our current partition.
   - Recursively call our function on the remaining substring.

5. **Backtracking Step**: We need to backtrack by removing the last added substring before trying the next possible substring.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation based on the above:



```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        def is_palindrome(subs: str) -> bool:
            return subs == subs[::-1]
        
        def backtrack(start: int, path: List[str]):
            if start == len(s):
                result.append(path[:])  # Append a copy of path to result
                return
            
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                substring = s[start:end]
                if is_palindrome(substring):
                    path.append(substring)  # Choose the current valid palindrome
                    backtrack(end, path)     # Move to the next starting point
                    path.pop()               # Backtrack
        
        result = []
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **is_palindrome function**: This function checks if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

2. **backtrack function**: 
   - It accepts a `start` index and a `path` list that stores the current partition.
   - If `start` equals the length of the string, it means we have a valid partition in `path`, so we append a copy of it to `result`.
   - A loop runs from `start + 1` to `len(s) + 1` to consider all possible substrings starting from the current index.
   - For each substring, if it's a palindrome, we append it to `path`, call `backtrack` to explore further partitions, and then backtrack by removing the last substring added.

3. At the end of the process, `result` contains all the possible partitions of the string into palindromic substrings.

### Edge Cases
- The function handles special cases like when `s` is a single character or when all characters are the same by checking every possible partition.

This solution efficiently finds all possible palindrome partitions by systematically exploring valid substrings and using backtracking to explore different combinations. The output will match the required format for submission on coding platforms like LeetCode.

# 132. Palindrome Partitioning II

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.


Example 2:
Input: s = "a"
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: s = "ab"
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 2000`
`s` consists of lower-case English letters only.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of a string `s`, we can use dynamic programming. The key idea is to keep track of palindrome substrings and the minimum cuts needed up to each index of the string.

### Explanation of the Approach

1. **Define Palindrome Status**:
   We will create a 2D list `is_palindrome` where `is_palindrome[i][j]` will be `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array for Cuts**:
   We will create a one-dimensional list `dp` such that `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of cuts needed for the substring `s[0:i+1]`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Every single character is a palindrome by itself. Thus, we can initialize `is_palindrome[i][i]` to `True`.
   - Initialize `dp[i]` to `i` because the worst case would be to cut every character.

4. **Fill Palindrome Table**:
   For each substring length from 2 to the length of `s`, check if the substring is a palindrome (i.e., the first and last characters are the same and the substring in between is also a palindrome).

5. **Update the Cuts**:
   If `s[0:i+1]` is a palindrome, no cuts are needed, so `dp[i]` can be set to `0`. If not, we will check each substring ending at `i`, and if its starting index creates a palindrome, we can update `dp[i]`.

6. **Result**:
   The value at `dp[n-1]` (where n is the length of the string) will give us the minimum cuts needed for the entire string.

### Python Code

Here’s how you can implement this approach in Python, formatted in a way that you could directly run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minCut(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Create a 2D array to store palindrome status
        is_palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Every single character is a palindrome
        for i in range(n):
            is_palindrome[i][i] = True
        
        # Fill the palindrome table
        for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of substring
            for start in range(n - length + 1):
                end = start + length - 1
                if s[start] == s[end]:
                    if length == 2:
                        is_palindrome[start][end] = True
                    else:
                        is_palindrome[start][end] = is_palindrome[start + 1][end - 1]
        
        # Create dp array for minimum cut
        dp = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if is_palindrome[0][i]:
                dp[i] = 0  # No cut needed if s[0:i+1] is palindrome
            else:
                min_cuts = float('inf')
                for j in range(i):
                    if is_palindrome[j + 1][i]:
                        min_cuts = min(min_cuts, dp[j] + 1)
                dp[i] = min_cuts
        
        return dp[-1]  # The last element will have the answer

```

### How to Run the Code on LeetCode

2. Navigate to the LeetCode problem page related to "Minimum Cuts for Palindrome Partitioning".
3. Make sure to paste the code into the code editor.
4. Click on "Submit" or "Run Code" to test it against the problem’s test cases.

This method operates in O(n^2) time complexity, which is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 2000 characters). The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the storage of palindrome results, although the actual cut calculation array is O(n).

# 139. Word Break

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.


Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".


Example 2:
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".

Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.


Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 300`
`1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
`1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
`s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

All the strings of `wordDict` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if a string can be segmented into a sequence of words from a given dictionary, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. Let's go through the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. We need to check if we can segment a string `s` using words from `wordDict`.
2. Each word from `wordDict` can be selected multiple times.
3. We will use dynamic programming to keep track of which prefixes of `s` can be formed using words from the dictionary.

### Dynamic Programming Approach
We will use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into words from `wordDict`. The length of `dp` will be `len(s) + 1` (to include the empty prefix).

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `dp[0] = True`, because an empty string can always be segmented.
2. For each index `i` from 1 to `len(s)`, check every possible word in `wordDict`:
   - For each word in the dictionary, check if the substring `s[i - len(word):i]` matches the word and if the preceding substring `s[0:i - len(word)]` can be segmented (i.e., `dp[i - len(word)]` is `True`).
3. If any match is found, set `dp[i] = True` and break out of the inner loop.
4. Finally, return the value of `dp[len(s)]`, which indicates if the entire string can be segmented.

### Code Implementation
Here’s how to implement the solution in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: list[str]) -> bool:
        # Convert list to a set for O(1) look-ups
        wordSet = set(wordDict)
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # An empty string can be segmented
        
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for word in wordSet:
                # Check if the current position can end with 'word'
                if i >= len(word) and s[i - len(word):i] == word:
                    if dp[i - len(word)]:
                        dp[i] = True
                        break  # No need to check further, word has matched these indices
        
        return dp[len(s)]  # Return the status of entire string

```

### Explanation of the Code
- We create a `Solution` class with a method `wordBreak` that takes in the string `s` and the dictionary list `wordDict`.
- We convert `wordDict` into a set `wordSet` for efficient lookups.
- The `dp` array is initialized with `False`, and `dp[0]` is set to `True` since the empty string is a valid segmentation.
- We iterate over each position in the string, and for each position, we check if any word from the dictionary can be a suffix of the substring up to that position.
- If we find a valid segmentation that includes the current word, we set `dp[i]` to `True`.
- Finally, we return `dp[len(s)]`, which tells us if the entire string can be segmented correctly.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * m) where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the average length of the words in `wordDict`, accounting for the nested iterations.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) for the `dp` array.

This implementation will correctly solve the problem for any valid input provided according to the constraints specified.

# 140. Word Break II

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.


Example 1:
Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]

Example 2:
Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.


Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: []

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 20`
`1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
`1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
`s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

All the strings of `wordDict` are unique.

### Solution 
 To tackle this problem of segmenting a string `s` into valid words from a given `wordDict`, we can utilize a backtracking approach. Backtracking allows us to explore all possible combinations of words that can be formed from `s` by repeatedly checking prefixes and exploring further into the string until we construct valid sentences.

### Steps to Solution:

1. **Backtracking Function**: We define a recursive function that will help us explore different combinations of words in the string `s`.
2. **Base Case**: If we have reached the end of the string `s`, we can add the current sentence to the results.
3. **Iterate Through Prefixes**: For every position in the string, check if the substring from the current position to any subsequent position is a valid word in the `wordDict`.
4. **Recursion**: If a valid word is found, make a recursive call to continue checking for the rest of the string.
5. **Memoization**: To optimize our solution, we can store results for previously computed substrings to avoid redundant computations.

Here's how we can implement this in Python, following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Convert wordDict into a set for quicker lookup
        wordSet = set(wordDict)
        result = []
        
        # Memoization cache
        self.memo = {}
        
        def backtrack(start: int):
            # If reached the end of the string, return an empty list
            if start == len(s):
                return [""]  # Return a list with an empty string
            
            # If the result for this start index is cached, return it
            if start in self.memo:
                return self.memo[start]
            
            sentences = []
            
            # Explore substrings starting from current index
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                word = s[start:end]
                if word in wordSet:
                    # Recur for the next part of the string
                    for sentence in backtrack(end):
                        # If sentence is empty, we don't add an extra space
                        if sentence:
                            sentences.append(word + " " + sentence)
                        else:
                            sentences.append(word)  # No space needed before the first word
            
            # Store the result in the cache
            self.memo[start] = sentences
            return sentences
        
        # Start backtracking from the beginning of the string
        result = backtrack(0)
        return result

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.wordBreak("catsanddog", ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]))
# Output: ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` with a method `wordBreak` that takes a string `s` and a list of words `wordDict`.
- **WordSet**: We first convert the `wordDict` list into a set called `wordSet` for O(1) lookup time.
- **Memoization Dictionary**: We use `self.memo` to cache results of processed starting indices to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Backtrack Function**: This is the core of our logic:
  - If the `start` index equals the length of `s`, this indicates we've reached the end of the string, returning a list with an empty string.
  - We then iterate through possible end indices, forming substrings, and checking them against `wordSet`.
  - For each valid word found, we call `backtrack` with the new end index and append the constructed sentences appropriately.
- **Final Return**: We invoke `backtrack` starting from index `0` and return the result list.

This code leverages recursion and memoization to efficiently explore all possible segmentations of the string into valid words. The algorithm has a time complexity that is managed effectively through memoization, making it suitable for the input constraints.

# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

It is guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
`-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of finding the contiguous subarray with the largest product in an integer array, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key point is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products at each position in the array, because a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large product when multiplied.

Here's a step-by-step explanation and a solution that follows the LeetCode format:

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing three variables:
   - `max_prod`: This keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
   - `min_prod`: This keeps track of the minimum product up to the current index (to handle negative numbers).
   - `result`: This will store the overall maximum product found.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - For each number in the array, we need to account for the fact that the next maximum product can be influenced by the current number, the current maximum product, and the current minimum product. Thus, we will calculate potential new maximum and minimum products for the current number:
     - `current_max_prod = max(num, max_prod * num, min_prod * num)`
     - `current_min_prod = min(num, max_prod * num, min_prod * num)`

3. **Update the maximum and minimum products**: After calculating the `current_max_prod` and `current_min_prod`, we update our `max_prod` and `min_prod`.

4. **Update the result**: We compare `max_prod` to `result` and update `result` if `max_prod` is larger.

5. **Return the result**: After iterating through the array, the result will contain the largest product of any contiguous subarray.

### Code Implementation

Below is the Python code that implements the above logic in the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        max_prod = nums[0]
        min_prod = nums[0]
        result = nums[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            num = nums[i]
            # If the current number is negative, swap the max and min
            if num < 0:
                max_prod, min_prod = min_prod, max_prod
            
            # Calculate the maximum and minimum
            max_prod = max(num, max_prod * num)
            min_prod = min(num, min_prod * num)
            
            # Update the result
            result = max(result, max_prod)
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` which contains the method `maxProduct`.
2. **Method Signature**: The method takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns an integer as output.
3. **Initialization**: The first element of the input array is used to initialize `max_prod`, `min_prod`, and `result`.
4. **Looping through the Array**: Starting from the second element (index 1), we loop through the array, adjusting `max_prod` and `min_prod` as we go, depending on each element's value.
5. **Handling Negatives**: If the current number is negative, we swap `max_prod` and `min_prod` to ensure we are correctly tracking the maximum and minimum products.
6. **Updating the Maximum Product**: We keep track of the largest product found with each iteration until we reach the end of the list.
7. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the result which is the largest product of a contiguous subarray. 

This solution efficiently computes the desired result with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

# 174. Dungeon Game

### Problem Description 
The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.


Example 1:
Input: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.


Example 2:
Input: dungeon = [[0]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`m == dungeon.length`
`n == dungeon[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 200`
`-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum initial health points required for the knight to successfully reach the princess in the dungeon, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to work backwards from the princess's position in the dungeon.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Understanding the Health Points**:
   - The knight's health decreases when he enters certain rooms (negative values) and increases when he enters rooms that are positive.
   - The goal is to find the minimum initial health that allows him to reach the bottom-right room without dying (health points cannot drop to zero or below at any room).

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We create a 2D list `minHealth` where `minHealth[i][j]` represents the minimum health required to enter room `(i, j)` and still reach the princess.
   - To reach the princess located at `(m-1, n-1)`, we need to compute the health requirements starting from this room and moving backwards to room `(0, 0)`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - We will compute values from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner of the dungeon.
   - The key formula to fill the `minHealth` table is:
     

```python
     minHealth[i][j] = max(1, minHealth[i+1][j] - dungeon[i][j], minHealth[i][j+1] - dungeon[i][j])
     
```
     Here, we consider moving down or right from the current room and ensure that the knight’s health never drops below 1.

### Implementation
Here's the Python code that implements the above approach:



```python
def calculateMinimumHP(dungeon):
    m = len(dungeon)
    n = len(dungeon[0])

    # Create a 2D list to store the minimum health required at each cell
    minHealth = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Start from the princess's room
    minHealth[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1])

    # Fill the last row (only can come from the left)
    for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        minHealth[m-1][j] = max(1, minHealth[m-1][j+1] - dungeon[m-1][j])

    # Fill the last column (only can come from above)
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        minHealth[i][n-1] = max(1, minHealth[i+1][n-1] - dungeon[i][n-1])

    # Fill the rest of the minHealth grid
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            minHealth[i][j] = max(1, min(minHealth[i+1][j], minHealth[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])

    return minHealth[0][0]

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize the dimensions of the dungeon and create the `minHealth` table with zeros.

2. **Base Case - Bottom-Right Room**:
   - We calculate the health needed for the bottom-right room using the health point adjustments based on its value.

3. **Filling Rows and Columns**:
   - The last row is filled from right to left because the knight can only come from the left.
   - The last column is filled from bottom to top because the knight can only come from above.
   
4. **Filling the Rest of the Table**:
   - We iterate through the remaining cells from the bottom-right to the top-left, applying the transition formula.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The minimum health required at the starting position `(0, 0)` is at `minHealth[0][0]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the dungeon.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the `minHealth` 2D list.

This solution is efficient and can be executed directly on the LeetCode platform.

# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.


Example 2:
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.


Constraints:
`0 <= k <= 100`
`0 <= prices.length <= 1000`
`0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To tackle the given problem of finding the maximum profit from stock trading with at most `k` transactions, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. Let’s break down the solution step by step and then provide the code formatted for LeetCode.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Transactions**:
   - A transaction consists of a **buy** followed by a **sell**. 
   - If we are allowed `k` transactions, it means we can make at most `k` buys followed by `k` sells.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We'll define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i`: The number of transactions (up to `k`).
     - `j`: The day (from 0 to `n-1` where `n` is the length of the `prices` array).
     - `dp[i][j]`: The maximum profit that can be achieved with up to `i` transactions up to day `j`.

3. **DP Initialization**:
   - If we have no prices (`prices.length == 0`), the maximum profit is `0`.
   - If `k` is `0`, then the maximum profit is also `0` because no transactions can be done.

4. **DP Transition**:
   - We can either choose not to perform a transaction on day `j`, in which case the profit remains the same as `dp[i][j-1]`.
   - Or we can perform a transaction. To handle this efficiently, we will track the best possible profit from buying on each previous day using a variable `max_diff`.
   - `max_diff` will store the maximum value of `dp[i-1][m] - prices[m]` (where `m` is any previous day before day `j`). This value allows us to compute the profit quickly.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Iterate through each transaction count from `1` to `k` and for each day calculate the maximum profit iteratively using the above logic.

### Python Code

Here is the Python code for the solution formatted for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        
        # If there are no prices, or no allowed transactions
        if n == 0 or k == 0:
            return 0
        
        # If number of transactions is more than n//2, it is equivalent to unlimited transactions
        if k >= n // 2:
            return sum(max(prices[i + 1] - prices[i], 0) for i in range(n - 1))
        
        # DP table where dp[i][j] = max profit with `i` transactions by day `j`
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):  # transaction count
            max_diff = -prices[0]
            for j in range(1, n):  # day index
                # Transition: we either don't trade or we conduct a transaction
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + max_diff)
                # Update max_diff
                max_diff = max(max_diff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j])
        
        return dp[k][n - 1]

```

### Key Points
- The code creates a DP table only when necessary and updates it based on previous computations.
- The loop structure is designed to maximize the profit with O(n * k) in time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The handling of cases where `k` exceeds `n/2` allows for optimization where multiple transactions aren't limited.

You can copy this code directly into LeetCode for testing and submission.

# 198. House Robber

### Problem Description 
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).

Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).

Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 100`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of robbing houses such that no two adjacent houses are robbed, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to keep track of the maximum amount of money we can rob up to each house, while ensuring that we do not rob two adjacent houses.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **Define the State**:
   Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If there are no houses (`nums` is empty), the maximum amount is `0`.
   - If there is only one house, the maximum amount is the amount in that house, i.e., `dp[0] = nums[0]`.

3. **State Transition**:
   For each house `i` from the second house onwards (`i >= 1`):
   - We have two choices:
     1. Do not rob the current house `i`: The maximum money remains `dp[i-1]`.
     2. Rob the current house `i`: We add the money from the current house `nums[i]` to the maximum money robbed from houses up to `i-2`, which is `dp[i-2]`.
   - Therefore, the relation is:
     
```
     dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + (dp[i-2] if i >= 2 else 0))
     
```

4. **Final Result**:
   The answer will be in `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the number of houses.

### Complete Code Implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Edge case: If there are no houses, return 0
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Edge case: If there is only one house, return its value
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        # Create a dp array to store the maximum money up to each house
        dp = [0] * n
        
        # Base case
        dp[0] = nums[0]  # If there is only one house, take the money from that house
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])  # Max of robbing the first house or the second house
        
        # Fill the dp array using the state transition defined above
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])
        
        # The answer is the maximum money that can be robbed from all the houses
        return dp[n-1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We start by checking for edge cases when there are no houses or just one house.
- We initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` of the same length as `nums` to store intermediate results.
- The first two houses are handled as base cases.
- We then iterate from the third house to the last house, applying the state transition formula. 
- At the end of the loop, `dp[n-1]` will contain the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without triggering the alarm.

This approach runs in O(n) time and uses O(n) space due to the `dp` array. Given the problem constraints, this is an efficient solution.

# 213. House Robber II

### Problem Description 
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).

Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 100`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the amount of money a robber can rob from houses arranged in a circle, we can utilize dynamic programming. The key insight is that the circular arrangement means that if we rob the first house, we cannot rob the last house, and vice versa.

Here is a detailed explanation and the implementation of how to approach this problem:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Since the houses are in a circle, if we decide to rob the first house, we cannot rob the last house. Conversely, if we do not rob the first house, we can potentially rob the last house.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - If we rob houses excluding the last one (`nums[0]` to `nums[n-2]`).
   - If we rob houses excluding the first one (`nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]`).
   
   We will solve the problem as two separate linear cases and take the maximum of both.

3. **Linear House Robbery**: The problem of robbing houses in a line can be solved using dynamic programming:
   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.
   - The recurrence relation will be:
     
```
     dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
     
```
   - This means that for each house, we can either skip it (take `dp[i-1]`) or rob it (which gives `nums[i] + dp[i-2]`).

4. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0] = nums[0]` (only one house to rob)
   - `dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])` (choose between the first or second house)

5. **Final Result**: The result will be the maximum of the two scenarios described.

### Implementation

Here is the Python code that implements the above approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Helper function to calculate maximum money from a linear array of houses
        def rob_linear(houses: List[int]) -> int:
            if not houses:
                return 0
            if len(houses) == 1:
                return houses[0]
            if len(houses) == 2:
                return max(houses[0], houses[1])
            
            dp = [0] * len(houses)
            dp[0] = houses[0]
            dp[1] = max(houses[0], houses[1])
            
            for i in range(2, len(houses)):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + houses[i])
                
            return dp[-1]
        
        # Calculate the maximum money by robbing from the first n-1 houses and the second n houses
        return max(rob_linear(nums[:-1]), rob_linear(nums[1:]))


```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `rob`.
- The method first handles the base cases where there are no houses or just one house.
- We define a helper function `rob_linear` which implements the dynamic programming solution for a linear arrangement of houses.
- Finally, we take the maximum value obtained by robbing from the first to the second last house and from the second to the last house.

This solution runs in O(n) time due to the single pass through the houses for both scenarios, and uses O(n) space for the `dp` array. It provides an optimal way to handle the circular dependency of the houses effectively.

# 221. Maximal Square

### Problem Description 
Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest square containing only `1`'s and return its area.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`m == matrix.length`
`n == matrix[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 300`
`matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the largest square containing only `1`s in a binary matrix and returning its area, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key idea is to maintain a table (or a 2D list in Python) where each entry at position `(i, j)` represents the length of the side of the largest square that can be formed with the bottom right corner at `(i, j)`.

### Explanation of the Solution Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Create a DP table of the same size as the input matrix, initialized to zero. We'll also need a variable to keep track of the maximum square length found during the process.

2. **Dynamic Programming Relation**:
   - If the current cell `matrix[i][j]` is a `1`, then the largest square that can end at `(i, j)` is determined by the minimum of the squares that can be formed from the left, top, and top-left diagonal cells. This can be expressed in the formula:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     \]
   - If `matrix[i][j]` is `0`, then `dp[i][j]` remains 0 since no square can end there.

3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the row or column index is `0` separately because they can only form squares of size 1 if they are `1`.

4. **Result Calculation**: The area of the largest square can be calculated as the square of the side length of the largest square found during the iteration.

Here is the complete Python code written in a LeetCode-compatible format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        # Create a DP table initialized to 0
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        max_length = 0
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                    # Handle the borders
                    if i == 0 or j == 0:
                        dp[i][j] = 1  # First row or column, can only be 1
                    else:
                        # Update the DP table using the formula
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                    # Update the maximum length found
                    max_length = max(max_length, dp[i][j])

        # The area is side length squared
        return max_length * max_length

```

### Example Walkthrough:
For the first example matrix:

```
[
   ["1","0","1","0","0"],
   ["1","0","1","1","1"],
   ["1","1","1","1","1"],
   ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]

```

- The DP table after processing would look something like this:

```
[
   [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
   [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
   [1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
   [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

```
- The largest value in the DP table is `2`, which means the largest square has a side length of `2`. Therefore, the area is `2 * 2 = 4`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) - We are iterating through each cell of the matrix exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) - We are using a 2D list to store the DP values, but this can be optimized to O(n) if we only keep the current and previous rows.

# 256. Paint House

### Problem Description 
There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.


Example 1:
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.

Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.


Example 2:
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
`costs.length == n`
`costs[i].length == 3`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of painting houses with the minimum cost while ensuring no two adjacent houses have the same color, we can approach this using dynamic programming. The goal is to keep track of the minimum cost to paint each house while ensuring the color rules are respected.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint up to the `i-th` house where the `i-th` house is painted with color `j`. Here, `j` can be 0 for red, 1 for blue, and 2 for green.

2. **Transition Formula**: For each house, the cost of painting that house in a particular color will be the cost of that color plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house with the other two colors. 
   - For example:
     - If house `i` is painted red, then:
       - `dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])`
     - Similarly, for blue and green:
       - `dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])`
       - `dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])`

3. **Base Case**: The cost of painting the first house (house `0`) is simply the cost of painting it with any of the three colors:
   - `dp[0][0] = costs[0][0]`
   - `dp[0][1] = costs[0][1]`
   - `dp[0][2] = costs[0][2]`

4. **Final Result**: After processing all houses, the minimum cost will be the minimum of the costs for painting the last house with any of the three colors:
   - `min(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2])`

### Python Code Implementation

This code can be directly run in the LeetCode environment.



```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0
        
        n = len(costs)
        # Initialize the dp array
        dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Base case: copy the cost of painting the first house
        dp[0][0] = costs[0][0]
        dp[0][1] = costs[0][1]
        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2]
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])  # If painted red
            dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])  # If painted blue
            dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])  # If painted green
            
        # Find the minimum cost to paint all houses
        return min(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2])

```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of houses. This is because we only make a single pass through the list of houses.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we maintain a DP table of size `n x 3`. However, we can optimize the space to O(1) by using only a couple of variables to keep track of the last calculated costs since the current calculations only depend on the previous house's costs.

This solution effectively addresses the problem while ensuring performance within the constraints specified in the prompt.

# 264. Ugly Number II

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return the `nth` ugly number.

Ugly number is a positive number whose prime factors only include `2`, `3`, and/or `5`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.


Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 1690`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the nth ugly number, we need to understand that an "ugly number" is defined as a positive number whose prime factors only include 2, 3, and 5. The sequence of ugly numbers starts from 1, and the next ugly numbers can be generated by multiplying existing ugly numbers by 2, 3, and 5.

### Explanation

To efficiently generate the nth ugly number, we will use a technique known as the "minimum heap" or "3-pointer technique." The key idea is to maintain a list of the currently found ugly numbers and then progressively build from those values. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start with the first ugly number which is `1`.
   - Maintain three pointers that indicate where to multiply to get the next potential ugly number by 2, 3, and 5.

2. **Generating Ugly Numbers**:
   - We will use a loop to find the next ugly number by considering the candidates from the current ugly numbers multiplied by 2, 3, and 5.
   - Select the minimum of these candidates to be the next ugly number.
   - Increment the pointers accordingly for whichever factor was used to generate the new ugly number.

3. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - Ugly numbers can be generated more than once (e.g., `6 = 2 * 3` and `6 = 3 * 2`). We have to ensure that we do not add duplicates into our sequence.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After generating the sequence up to nth ugly number, return the last added number which will be the nth ugly number.

### Implementation

Now let's implement this logic in Python. Below is the code which adheres to the LeetCode format.



```python
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Create a list to hold the ugly numbers
        ugly_numbers = [0] * n
        ugly_numbers[0] = 1  # The first ugly number is 1

        # Initialize indices for multiples of 2, 3, and 5
        idx2, idx3, idx5 = 0, 0, 0
        
        # Initial next multiples of 2, 3, and 5
        next2, next3, next5 = 2, 3, 5
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Get the next ugly number
            next_ugly = min(next2, next3, next5)
            ugly_numbers[i] = next_ugly
            
            # Increment the index for which multiple was used
            if next_ugly == next2:
                idx2 += 1
                next2 = ugly_numbers[idx2] * 2
            if next_ugly == next3:
                idx3 += 1
                next3 = ugly_numbers[idx3] * 3
            if next_ugly == next5:
                idx5 += 1
                next5 = ugly_numbers[idx5] * 5
        
        # The nth ugly number will be at index n-1
        return ugly_numbers[-1]

```

### How to Use the Code

- To use this code in a LeetCode submission:
  1. Copy the entire `Solution` class.
  2. On the LeetCode platform, create a new problem submission, choose the language as Python, and paste the code.
  3. You can test it with the provided examples or any other cases by calling `Solution().nthUglyNumber(n)`, where `n` is the desired ugly number index.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we are generating n ugly numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because we are storing the first n ugly numbers in a list.

This implementation is efficient and should work well within the provided constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1690).

# 265. Paint House II

### Problem Description 
There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.


Example 1:
Input: costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.


Example 2:
Input: costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`costs.length == n`
`costs[i].length == k`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= k <= 20`
`1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`
Follow up: Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of painting houses with minimum cost while ensuring that no two adjacent houses have the same color, we can use dynamic programming. This approach allows us to maintain the computed minimum costs efficiently.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input Matrix**: We're given a matrix `costs` where `costs[i][j]` is the cost of painting house `i` with color `j`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We will create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint up to house `i`, where house `i` is painted with color `j`.

3. **Transition Relation**:
   - For each house `i` and each color `j`, the cost of painting house `i` with color `j` will be its painting cost plus the minimum cost of painting house `i-1` with any color that is not `j`. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + \min(dp[i-1][m]) \text{ for all } m 
eq j
     \]
   - To efficiently determine the minimum cost for the previous house, we can find the two smallest values in the previous row, which allows us to compute the current minimum without iterating through all colors.

4. **Output**: The minimum cost to paint all houses will be the minimum value in the last row of our dynamic programming table.

### Implementation:

Here's the implementation in Python according to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0
        
        n = len(costs)  # number of houses
        k = len(costs[0])  # number of colors
        
        # If there's only one house, return the minimum cost of that house's painting options
        if n == 1:
            return min(costs[0])
        
        # Initialize the DP array, dp[i][j] will represent the minimum cost to paint house i with color j
        dp = costs[:]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Find the minimum and second minimum in the previous row
            min1 = float('inf')
            min2 = float('inf')
            min1_index = -1
            
            for j in range(k):
                if dp[i-1][j] < min1:
                    min2 = min1
                    min1 = dp[i-1][j]
                    min1_index = j
                elif dp[i-1][j] < min2:
                    min2 = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Update the current dp row
            for j in range(k):
                if j == min1_index:
                    dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min2  # Use the second minimum
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min1  # Use the minimum
        
        # The result will be the minimum value in the last row
        return min(dp[n-1])


```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: We check if the `costs` list is empty and initialize `n` (houses) and `k` (colors). If there's only one house, we return the minimum cost directly.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction**:
   - We copy the first row from `costs` into `dp` because the cost of painting the first house is simply the cost given.
   - We then iterate through the houses from the second one, calculating the minimum costs for each color of the current house based on the previous house's costs.

3. **Finding Minimum Costs**:
   - For each house, we find the two smallest costs from the previous house’s costs. This enables us to update the current house’s costs avoiding the color of the previous house.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all houses, the minimum value from the last house's cost array gives the final answer.

This solution operates efficiently in \(O(n \cdot k)\) time, as each house requires inspecting all available colors, and maintains space usage proportional to the number of colors.

# 276. Paint Fence

### Problem Description 
You are painting a fence of `n` posts with `k` different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:
Every post must be painted exactly one color.

At most one pair of adjacent fence posts can have the same color.

Given the two integers `n` and `k`, return the number of ways you can paint the fence.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.

Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there can only be at most one pair of adjacent posts that are the same color.


Example 2:
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 42

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 50`
`1 <= k <= 105`
The answer is guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 231 - 1]` for the given `n` and `k`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of painting fence posts with specific constraints, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's break down the problem, how we will formulate our solution, and provide a complete implementation.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Rules**: We need to paint `n` posts with `k` colors. The key rule is that at most one pair of adjacent posts can have the same color. This means if the last post is painted the same color as the one before it, the post before that cannot be painted the same color.

2. **Dynamic Programming State**:
   - We can define two states:
     - `dp[i]`: The number of ways to paint `i` posts where the last two posts are different colors.
     - `same[i]`: The number of ways to paint `i` posts where the last two posts have the same color.

3. **Recurrence Relations**:
   - To calculate these states, we can use the following logic:
     - `dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + same[i - 1])`
       - Here we can choose any of the `k - 1` colors to paint the current post (the last post) different from the previous one.
     - `same[i] = dp[i - 1]`
       - The only way to have the last two posts be the same color is if the last one was different, so we take all configurations of `dp[i - 1]`.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`: 
     - `dp[1] = k` (any of the k colors for the first post)
     - `same[1] = 0` (there can't be a same-color pair with just one post).

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total number of ways to paint `n` posts will be `dp[n] + same[n]`.

Now, let's implement this logic in Python according to the LeetCode solution structure.

### Python Code Implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return k
            
        # Initialize dp and same arrays
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        same = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Base case for 1 post
        dp[1] = k
        same[1] = 0
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + same[i - 1])
            same[i] = dp[i - 1]
        
        # Total ways to paint the fence
        return dp[n] + same[n]

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.numWays(3, 2)) # Output: 6
print(solution.numWays(1, 1)) # Output: 1
print(solution.numWays(7, 2)) # Output: 42

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` and implement the function `numWays`.
- We handle base cases for 0 and 1 posts.
- We initialize `dp` and `same` lists to hold counts for `n` from 1 to the required number.
- We fill out our `dp` and `same` using the established recurrence relations.
- Finally, we return the sum of ways to paint `n` posts, factoring both conditions.

This approach runs in O(n) time and requires O(n) space for the arrays, making it efficient given the constraints.

# 279. Perfect Squares

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.


Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.


Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to a given integer `n`, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. The key idea is to build a table where each index `i` stores the minimum number of perfect square numbers needed to sum up to `i`.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Perfect Squares Detection**: First, we need to generate all perfect square numbers less than or equal to `n`. This can be done by squaring integers starting from `1` until the square exceeds `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will create a list `dp` where `dp[i]` denotes the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `i`. 
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `0` (base case: zero can be made with zero numbers).
   - All other entries can be initialized to `infinity` (`float('inf')`) to represent that they are not computed yet.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: For each number from `1` to `n`, update the `dp` list using the perfect squares computed in step 1. For each square number, if it can contribute to the sum of `i` (i.e., `i - square >= 0`), we update `dp[i]` as:
   \[
   dp[i] = \min(dp[i], dp[i - \text{square}] + 1)
   \]
   This means we check the minimum value between the current `dp[i]` and the value of `dp` for the remaining sum after taking this perfect square plus one additional count for the current perfect square.

4. **Result**: The result will be stored in `dp[n]` after we fill the table.

### Python Code

Here is the code that implements the above plan in a format that can be directly run on the LeetCode platform:



```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Generate all perfect squares less than or equal to n
        perfect_squares = []
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            perfect_squares.append(i * i)
            i += 1

        # Step 2: Create DP array
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 perfect squares to sum up to 0

        # Step 3: Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for square in perfect_squares:
                if square > i:
                    break
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1)

        # Step 4: Return the result for n
        return dp[n]

```

### Explanation of Test Cases

1. For `n = 12`:
   - The possible perfect squares are `1, 4, 9`.
   - We can express `12` as `4 + 4 + 4`, thus requiring `3` perfect squares.

2. For `n = 13`:
   - The possible perfect squares are `1, 4, 9`.
   - The optimal expression is `9 + 4`, thus requiring `2` perfect squares.

### Constraints Handled
- The algorithm runs efficiently within the constraints `1 <= n <= 10^4` due to a time complexity of \(O(n \sqrt{n})\).

This code can be easily copied into a LeetCode problem-solving environment and run successfully to find the least number of perfect squares that sum to a given integer `n`.

# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
Follow up:
Could you come up with the `O(n2)` solution?
Could you improve it to `O(n log(n))` time complexity?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array, we can utilize two approaches: a more straightforward dynamic programming approach with \( O(n^2) \) time complexity and a more optimized approach involving binary search that achieves \( O(n \log n) \) time complexity. We'll implement the \( O(n \log n) \) solution as it is more efficient for larger input sizes.

### Explanation of the \( O(n \log n) \) Solution:

The key idea of the \( O(n \log n) \) solution is to use a dynamic array (let's call it `dp`) to store the smallest possible tail values of subsequences of different lengths. 

1. **Initialization**: We will maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will hold the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length \( i + 1 \).

2. **Binary Search**: For each number in the input array, we will use binary search (via the `bisect` module) to determine the position where this number would fit in the `dp` array. 
   - If the number is larger than all elements in `dp`, add it to `dp`.
   - If it can replace an existing value, we replace that value (because a smaller tail will allow a longer increasing subsequence in the future).

3. **Length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence**: The length of `dp` will give us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Implementation:

Here’s how you can implement it in Python following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
from bisect import bisect_left

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # dp array to store the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences
        dp = []

        for num in nums:
            # Use binary search to find the insertion point
            idx = bisect_left(dp, num)
            
            # If num is greater than any element in dp
            if idx == len(dp):
                dp.append(num)
            else:
                # Replace the existing value to keep the smallest tail
                dp[idx] = num
        
        # The length of dp is the length of the longest increasing subsequence
        return len(dp)


```

### Detailed Breakdown:

- **`from bisect import bisect_left`**: We import `bisect_left`, which allows us to perform binary search to find the index of the first element in `dp` that is not less than `num`.

- **`dp = []`**: This list will store the smallest last elements of increasing subsequences of varying lengths.

- **`for num in nums:`**: We iterate through each number in the provided `nums` array.

- **`idx = bisect_left(dp, num)`**: We find the appropriate index in `dp` where `num` would fit in to maintain sorted order.

- **`if idx == len(dp):`**: If `num` is greater than all elements currently in `dp`, it extends the largest subsequence so far.

- **`else:`**: If `num` can replace an existing element, we update `dp[idx]` to be `num`, which helps in maintaining a potential new increasing subsequence.

- **`return len(dp)`**: Finally, we return the length of `dp`, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The overall time complexity of this solution is \( O(n \log n) \) because:
  - Each of the \( n \) numbers is processed by performing a binary search within the `dp` list.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \( O(n) \) in the worst case, due to the storage in the `dp` list. However, in practice, it will be much smaller, as `dp` grows only for unique increasing subsequences.

This solution effectively meets the problem constraints and performs efficiently even for the maximum input size allowed by the problem statement.

# 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums`, find the sum of the elements between indices `left` and `right` inclusive, where `(left <= right)`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:
`NumArray(int[] nums)` initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.

`int sumRange(int left, int right)` returns the sum of the elements of the `nums` array in the range `[left, right]` inclusive (i.e., `sum(nums[left], nums[left + 1], ... , nums[right])`).


Example 1:
Input
["NumArray", "sumRange", "sumRange", "sumRange"]
[[[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]], [0, 2], [2, 5], [0, 5]]
Output
[null, 1, -1, -3]
Explanation
NumArray numArray = new NumArray([-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 ((-2) + 0 + 3)
numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return -1 (3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1)) 
numArray.sumRange(0, 5); // return -3 ((-2) + 0 + 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1))

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 104`
`-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
`0 <= left <= right < nums.length`
At most `104` calls will be made to `sumRange`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the sum of a specified range within an integer array, we'll implement a class called `NumArray`. This class will be initialized with an integer array and will handle multiple calls to sum ranges efficiently.

## Explanation:

### Approach

1. **Initialization of the Data Structure**:
   - We'll use a list to hold the prefix sums of the array. The prefix sum at index `i` will contain the sum of elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - This allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time, O(1), by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.

2. **Calculating Prefix Sums**:
   - For an array `nums`, the prefix sum array `prefix` will be defined such that:
     - `prefix[0] = nums[0]`
     - `prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + nums[i]` for `i > 0`
   - This setup means that `prefix[right]` contains the sum of the elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[right]`.

3. **Calculating Sum for a Range**:
   - To find the sum for any range `[left, right]`, use:
     - `sumRange(left, right) = prefix[right] - (prefix[left - 1] if left > 0 else 0)`
   - This formula utilizes the prefix sum array to efficiently get the range sum.

### Class Implementation in Python

Here's the complete implementation:



```python
class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix = [0] * len(nums)
        if len(nums) > 0:
            self.prefix[0] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            self.prefix[i] = self.prefix[i - 1] + nums[i]

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        if left == 0:
            return self.prefix[right]
        return self.prefix[right] - self.prefix[left - 1]


```

### Detailed Steps in the Code:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The constructor initializes the `prefix` array.
   - It first checks if `nums` is non-empty and sets the first element of the prefix sum.
   - It then computes the prefix sums in a loop.

2. **Range Query (`sumRange` method)**:
   - This method computes the sum from `left` to `right` based on the prefix sums.
   - If `left` is `0`, it directly returns the prefix sum at `right`.
   - Otherwise, it subtracts the prefix sum at `left - 1` from the prefix sum at `right` to get the correct range sum.

### Example Execution

Given the input:


```python
["NumArray", "sumRange", "sumRange", "sumRange"]
[[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1], [0, 2], [2, 5], [0, 5]]

```
The output will be:


```python
[null, 1, -1, -3]

```

### Constraints Handling
- The implementation efficiently handles the constraints provided, ensuring that up to 10^4 calls to `sumRange` can be answered in constant time, thanks to the prefix sums.

This structure and approach make it easy to manage sum queries efficiently while ensuring good performance for large input sizes.

# 304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable

### Problem Description 
Given a 2D matrix `matrix`, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`.

Implement the NumMatrix class:
`NumMatrix(int[][] matrix)` initializes the object with the integer matrix `matrix`.

`int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2)` returns the sum of the elements of the `matrix` array inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`.


Example 1:
Input
["NumMatrix", "sumRegion", "sumRegion", "sumRegion"]
[[[[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]], [2, 1, 4, 3], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 4]]
Output
[null, 8, 11, 12]
Explanation
NumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix([[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]);
numMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3); // return 8 (i.e sum of the red rectangele).

numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2); // return 11 (i.e sum of the green rectangele).

numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4); // return 12 (i.e sum of the blue rectangele).


Constraints:
`m == matrix.length`
`n == matrix[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 200`
`-105 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105`
`0 <= row1 <= row2 < m`
`0 <= col1 <= col2 < n`
At most `104` calls will be made to `sumRegion`.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of finding the sum of the elements in a rectangular sub-region of a 2D matrix, we can use a technique called a 2D prefix sum array. This allows us to efficiently compute the sum of any sub-region of the matrix in constant time after an initialization phase.

### Explanation:

1. **Prefix Sum Concept**:
   - The prefix sum array will store cumulative sums such that each element at position `(i, j)` contains the sum of all elements in the rectangle from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`.
   - This allows us to derive any rectangle's sum using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

2. **Construction of the `NumMatrix` Class**:
   - We initialize the matrix and create a prefix sum array during the construction of the `NumMatrix`.
   - The prefix sum will be built such that `prefix[i][j]` contains the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` using the formula:
     
```
     prefix[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1]
     
```
   - The subtraction of `prefix[i-1][j-1]` is necessary to avoid double counting the overlapping area.

3. **Calculating the Sum Region**:
   - When calculating the sum for any rectangle defined by corners `(row1, col1)` and `(row2, col2)`, we can derive it using:
     
```
     sumRegion = prefix[row2][col2]
                 - (prefix[row1-1][col2] if row1 > 0 else 0)
                 - (prefix[row2][col1-1] if col1 > 0 else 0)
                 + (prefix[row1-1][col1-1] if row1 > 0 and col1 > 0 else 0)
     
```

### Python Code:

Here’s how to implement the above logic in Python:



```python
class NumMatrix:

    def __init__(self, matrix):
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            self.rows, self.cols = 0, 0
            self.prefix_sum = []
            return
        self.rows, self.cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        self.prefix_sum = [[0] * self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]
        
        # Building the prefix sum array
        for i in range(self.rows):
            for j in range(self.cols):
                self.prefix_sum[i][j] = matrix[i][j]
                if i > 0:
                    self.prefix_sum[i][j] += self.prefix_sum[i - 1][j]
                if j > 0:
                    self.prefix_sum[i][j] += self.prefix_sum[i][j - 1]
                if i > 0 and j > 0:
                    self.prefix_sum[i][j] -= self.prefix_sum[i - 1][j - 1]

    def sumRegion(self, row1, col1, row2, col2):
        total = self.prefix_sum[row2][col2]
        if row1 > 0:
            total -= self.prefix_sum[row1 - 1][col2]
        if col1 > 0:
            total -= self.prefix_sum[row2][col1 - 1]
        if row1 > 0 and col1 > 0:
            total += self.prefix_sum[row1 - 1][col1 - 1]
        return total

```

### Usage:

You can now create an instance of `NumMatrix` and call the `sumRegion` method to get sums for specific sub-regions of the matrix. Here's an example based on the provided input:



```python
# Example usage:
numMatrix = NumMatrix([[3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
                        [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
                        [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
                        [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
                        [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]])
print(numMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3)) # Output: 8
print(numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2)) # Output: 11
print(numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4)) # Output: 12

```

### Complexity:
- **Initialization**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.
- **Sum region calculation**: O(1) for each region query.
- Overall, this ensures efficient handling of up to `10^4` queries as stated in the problem constraints.

# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
`0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of maximizing profit with stock prices under the given constraints (specifically, allowing multiple transactions but enforcing a cooldown day after each sale), we can employ a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve this problem, followed by the complete implementation in Python.

### Explanation

1. **State Definition**:
   We define three states for dynamic programming:
   - `hold[i]`: The maximum profit we can have on day `i` if we hold a stock on that day.
   - `sold[i]`: The maximum profit we can have on day `i` if we have just sold a stock on that day.
   - `cooldown[i]`: The maximum profit we can have on day `i` if we are in a cooldown state (the day after a sale).

2. **Recurrence Relations**:
   The transitions for each state can be defined as:
   - To **hold** a stock on day `i`: 
     - Either we held it from the previous day: `hold[i] = hold[i-1]`
     - Or we bought it on day `i` after being in cooldown: `hold[i] = cooldown[i-1] - prices[i]`
   
   - To **sell** a stock on day `i`: 
     - We can sell it if we held it the previous day: `sold[i] = hold[i-1] + prices[i]`
   
   - For the **cooldown** on day `i`:
     - We can come from either being in hold or sold the previous day: `cooldown[i] = max(sold[i-1], cooldown[i-1])`

3. **Base Cases**:
   - On day 0:
     - If we hold the stock, we pay the price: `hold[0] = -prices[0]`
     - If we sell, we can't sell on day 0, so: `sold[0] = 0`
     - If we're in cooldown on day 0, we also have nothing: `cooldown[0] = 0`

4. **Final Solution**:
   The maximum profit will be the best outcome from either being in sold or cooldown state at the last day: `max(sold[n-1], cooldown[n-1])`.

Now, let's implement the above logic in Python, formatted for a LeetCode submission.

### LeetCode-style Solution



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize the DP arrays
        hold = [0] * n
        sold = [0] * n
        cooldown = [0] * n
        
        # Base case for day 0
        hold[0] = -prices[0]  # We buy on day 0
        sold[0] = 0           # Can't sell on the first day
        cooldown[0] = 0       # No cooldown on the first day
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], cooldown[i-1] - prices[i])  # Holding stock
            sold[i] = hold[i-1] + prices[i]                      # Selling stock
            cooldown[i] = max(sold[i-1], cooldown[i-1])         # Cooldown
            
        return max(sold[n-1], cooldown[n-1])  # Max profit at the last day

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The code defines a class `Solution` and a method `maxProfit` that takes a list of integers `prices`.
- It initializes three lists (`hold`, `sold`, `cooldown`) to keep track of the maximum profit for each state on each day.
- It iterates through the days, updating the profit values based on the defined state transitions.
- Finally, it returns the maximum profit possible at the end of the last day, considering both the sold and cooldown scenarios.

The complexity of this solution is O(n) for time and O(n) for space, which is efficient given the constraints.

# 312. Burst Balloons

### Problem Description 
You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5]
Output: 10

Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`1 <= n <= 500`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the coins collected by bursting balloons optimally, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to consider every possible order of bursting the balloons and use memoization to store intermediate results (maximum coins) to avoid redundant calculations.

### Dynamic Programming Explanation

1. **Define the Problem**:
   Each time we burst a balloon at index `i`, we get coins based on the product of the two adjacent balloons plus the balloon itself. If the balloon is at the boundary (i.e., the first or last balloon), we treat the boundary condition as having a balloon with a value of `1`.

2. **State Representation**:
   Let `dp[l][r]` represent the maximum coins we can collect by bursting all the balloons in the range `[l, r]`.

3. **Base Case**:
   If `l > r`, then the coins collected will be `0`. Thus, `dp[l][r] = 0`.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   If we decide to burst the balloon at index `k` between `l` and `r`, the coins collected by bursting balloon `k` is `nums[l-1] * nums[k] * nums[r+1]` plus the results from `dp[l][k-1]` and `dp[k+1][r]`:
   \[
   dp[l][r] = \max(dp[l][r], dp[l][k-1] + dp[k+1][r] + nums[l-1] * nums[k] * nums[r+1])
   \]

5. **Initialization**:
   We need to create a modified `nums` array with additional boundary values of `1` to facilitate calculations.

6. **Final Result**:
   The result will be stored in `dp[1][n]` (considering the boundaries artificially added).

### Python Code

Here’s the implementation of the above approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Add a boundary of 1 to both ends
        nums = [1] + nums + [1]
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Create a dp table
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Fill the dp array
        for length in range(1, n - 1):  # length of the range (1 to n-2)
            for left in range(1, n - length):  # start of the range
                right = left + length - 1  # end of the range
                # Try bursting every balloon in the range [left, right]
                for i in range(left, right + 1):
                    coins = nums[left - 1] * nums[i] * nums[right + 1]  # coins from bursting i
                    coins += dp[left][i - 1] + dp[i + 1][right]  # add the coins from subproblems
                    dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], coins)

        # The answer is the maximum coins we can collect from bursting all balloons
        return dp[1][n - 2]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- First, we modify the `nums` array to include `1` at the start and end.
- We create a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum coins for each subproblem defined by its indices.
- We iterate over all possible lengths of balloon ranges and calculate the maximum coins for each possible left and right indices.
- For each choice of balloon to burst in a given range, we calculate the resultant coins and update our `dp` table accordingly.
- Finally, the result can be found in `dp[1][n - 2]`, which gives us the maximum coins that can be collected by bursting all the balloons.

This algorithm runs in \(O(n^3)\), which is efficient enough given the constraints.

# 321. Create Maximum Number

### Problem Description 
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively. `nums1` and `nums2` represent the digits of two numbers. You are also given an integer `k`.

Create the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` from digits of the two numbers. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.

Return an array of the `k` digits representing the answer.


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [3,4,6,5], nums2 = [9,1,2,5,8,3], k = 5
Output: [9,8,6,5,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [6,7], nums2 = [6,0,4], k = 5
Output: [6,7,6,0,4]

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [3,9], nums2 = [8,9], k = 3
Output: [9,8,9]

Constraints:
`m == nums1.length`
`n == nums2.length`
`1 <= m, n <= 500`
`0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 9`
`1 <= k <= m + n`
Follow up: Try to optimize your time and space complexity.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of creating the maximum number of length `k` from the digits of two numbers represented by arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, we can follow a multi-step approach. First, we'll define helper functions to find the maximum subsequence of length `x` from an array while maintaining the order. Then, we need to merge two subsequences to get the final result.

Here’s a detailed explanation and the Python code that adheres to the LeetCode solution format.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Finding the Maximum Subsequence**: We need a function `max_subsequence` that will help us find the maximum sequence of digits of length `x` from a given list while preserving the order. This can be done using a stack-based approach.

2. **Merge Subsequences**: Next, we will create a function `merge` that will take in two subsequences and merge them into the largest possible number while preserving the order.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Selections**: Finally, we will iterate through all possible pairs of maximum subsequences of lengths `i` and `k-i` (for all `i` from `0` to `k`), and use the above two functions to get the maximum possible number.

4. **Return the Result**: Keep track of the largest sequence formed during the iterations and return that as the final result.

### Code Implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumber(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        def max_subsequence(nums, length):
            drop = len(nums) - length
            stack = []
            for num in nums:
                while drop and stack and stack[-1] < num:
                    stack.pop()
                    drop -= 1
                stack.append(num)
            return stack[:length]

        def merge(subseq1, subseq2):
            merged = []
            while subseq1 or subseq2:
                if subseq1 > subseq2:  # Compare while preserving order
                    merged.append(subseq1.pop(0))
                else:
                    merged.append(subseq2.pop(0))
            return merged

        max_result = []
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)

        for i in range(max(0, k - n), min(m, k) + 1):
            subseq1 = max_subsequence(nums1, i)
            subseq2 = max_subsequence(nums2, k - i)
            merged = merge(subseq1, subseq2)
            max_result = max(max_result, merged)

        return max_result

```

### Explanation:

1. **max_subsequence Function**:
    - This function creates the largest possible subsequence of the specified length. It uses a stack to keep track of the numbers and pops values less than the current number if we are allowed to drop more digits (`drop > 0`).

2. **merge Function**:
    - This function takes two lists and merges them. It compares the two lists lexicographically and appends the larger (in terms of priority) to the merged list while maintaining the order.

3. **Main Logic**:
    - We calculate the maximum length of subsequence we can take from `nums1` and `nums2`. For each possible split (from `0` to `k`), we generate the respective subsequences and merge them.
    - We keep track of the maximum result using Python’s list comparison.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity primarily involves creating subsequences and merging, leading to a complexity of O((m + n) * k). This is efficient given the constraints (up to 1000 combined digits).

This implementation is optimal and meets the constraints provided in the problem statement. It can be pasted directly into LeetCode for execution.

# 322. Coin Change

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


Example 1:
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Example 2:
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0

Example 4:
Input: coins = [1], amount = 1
Output: 1

Example 5:
Input: coins = [1], amount = 2
Output: 2

Constraints:
`1 <= coins.length <= 12`
`1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
`0 <= amount <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the fewest number of coins needed to make up a given amount with various denominations, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to create an array where each index represents the minimum number of coins required to make that amount. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**:
   - We create a DP array called `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount `i`.
   - Initialize the array with a value greater than any possible number of coins (in this case, we can use `amount + 1` since it's impossible to require more coins than the amount itself).
   - Set `dp[0]` to `0` because no coins are needed to make the amount `0`.

2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - We iterate through each coin and for each coin, we update the DP array for all amounts from that coin's denomination to the target amount.
   - For each amount `j`, we update `dp[j]` as the minimum between its current value and `dp[j - coin] + 1` (which represents using one more coin of the current type).

3. **Result Extraction**:
   - After filling the DP array, the value `dp[amount]` will contain the minimum number of coins needed to make up the specified amount. If `dp[amount]` remains as `amount + 1`, then it signifies that it's not possible to form that amount with the given coins, and we should return `-1`.

Here’s the Python code that implements the above plan in the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the DP array with a value greater than any possible number of coins
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0

        # Fill the DP array
        for coin in coins:
            for j in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)

        # Return the result
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `coinChange` that takes two parameters: `coins` (a list of integers representing coin denominations) and `amount` (the target amount).
- We initialize the DP array `dp` of size `amount + 1` to hold the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from `0` to `amount`.
- We iterate over each coin and update possible amounts that can be made using that coin. We do this using a nested loop where the outer loop iterates through the coins, and the inner loop iterates through the relevant amounts.
- Finally, we check whether `dp[amount]` has been updated from its initial value (`float('inf')`). If it has, we return the value; otherwise, we return `-1` indicating that the amount cannot be formed with the given coins.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * amount), where `n` is the number of different denominations of coins, and a space complexity of O(amount) due to the DP array. The code can be submitted directly to LeetCode for testing.

# 337. House Robber III

### Problem Description 
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem where a thief wants to rob houses structured as a binary tree without alerting the police, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach combined with memoization.

### Explanation of Approach

1. **Understanding Tree Structure**: The binary tree can be thought of as a collection of nodes where each node represents a house containing money. Each house can have two children (left and right), and the constraint is that if a house is robbed, its direct children cannot be robbed on the same night.

2. **Dynamic Programming via DFS**: We can use a DFS approach to explore the tree. For every house (node), we can decide either:
   - To rob that house (and thus we cannot rob its children).
   - Not rob that house (and thus we can consider robbing its children).
   
   This can be represented as two states:
   - `rob`, which gives the total money when robbing the current house.
   - `not_rob`, which gives the total money when not robbing the current house.

3. **Recursion with Memoization**:
   - For each node, we calculate the maximum money the thief can get by choosing to rob that node or skipping it and taking the maximum loot from its children.
   - We use memoization to cache results for already visited nodes to avoid redundant calculations.

### Python Code

Here is the Python code that implements the above logic following the LeetCode format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return (0, 0)
            
            left = dfs(node.left)
            right = dfs(node.right)
            
            # If we rob this node, we cannot rob its children
            rob_current = node.val + left[1] + right[1]
            # If we do not rob this node, we take the maximum from both children
            not_rob_current = max(left) + max(right)
            
            return (rob_current, not_rob_current)
        
        result = dfs(root)
        return max(result)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **TreeNode Class**: This class is defined for creating tree nodes.
- **rob Method**: This is the main method to solve the problem. It calls the DFS helper function on the root of the tree.
- **dfs Function**:
  - It returns a tuple `(rob_current, not_rob_current)`, where:
    - `rob_current`: Maximum money if the current node is robbed.
    - `not_rob_current`: Maximum money if the current node is not robbed. 
  - It recursively computes these values for left and right children and calculates the maximum profit obtainable.
- Finally, we call `max(result)` to get the maximum money the thief can rob.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to recursion stack usage.

This solution efficiently determines the optimal strategy for the thief with a clear strategy leveraging DFS and memoization.

# 338. Counting Bits

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `num`, return an array of the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of every number in the range `[0, num]`.


Example 1:
Input: num = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

Example 2:
Input: num = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

Constraints:
`0 <= num <= 105`
Follow up:
It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time `O(32n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
Could you solve it in `O(n)` space complexity?
Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of `1`s in the binary representation of every number from `0` to `num`, we can use dynamic programming. The goal is to achieve an `O(n)` time complexity and `O(n)` space complexity.

Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

### Explanation

For any integer \( i \), the number of `1`s in its binary representation can be derived from the binary representation of \( i \) with respect to the largest power of two less than or equal to \( i \). This is based on the observation that:
- If \( i \) is even, it can be expressed as \( 2 \times k \), where the number of `1`s in the binary representation of \( i \) is the same as \( k \) (i.e., `countSetBits(i) = countSetBits(k)`).
- If \( i \) is odd, it can be expressed as \( 2 \times k + 1 \), where the number of `1`s in the binary representation of \( i \) is one more than the number of `1`s in \( k \) (i.e., `countSetBits(i) = countSetBits(k) + 1`).

Using this logic, we can build an array `counts` where `counts[i]` will store the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `i`. The relationship can be expressed as:
- `counts[i] = counts[i >> 1] + (i & 1)` 

Where `i >> 1` is the result of right-shifting `i` by one bit (which effectively divides `i` by 2) and `i & 1` checks if the least significant bit of `i` is `1`.

### Steps

1. Initialize a list `counts` of size `num + 1` (to include `0` to `num`).
2. Iterate over each integer from `1` to `num`:
   - For each integer, calculate the number of `1`s based on the previously established relationships.
3. Return the list `counts`.

### Python Code

Here's the implementation of the above logic in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, num: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize an array of size num + 1 with zeros
        counts = [0] * (num + 1)
        
        # Iterate through each number from 1 to num
        for i in range(1, num + 1):
            # counts[i] = counts[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
            counts[i] = counts[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
        
        # Return the result
        return counts

```

### Key Points
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the input number (the loop runs `n` times).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the storage of the counts array.
- The implementation avoids using any built-in functions to count bits and directly calculates the count based on bit manipulations.

### Testing
You can run this code directly on the LeetCode platform, and it should produce the expected results for all inputs defined by the constraints. Each number from `0` to `num` will have its binary `1`s counted correctly using the efficient method described.

# 343. Integer Break

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, break it into the sum of `k` positive integers, where `k >= 2`, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.


Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.


Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 58`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of breaking an integer `n` into the sum of `k` positive integers to maximize their product, we can use a mathematical approach. The idea is based on the properties of numbers and products.

### Explanation:

When breaking a number into two or more parts to maximize the product, it turns out that the best results come from using numbers close to `2` and `3`. Specifically:
- If `n` can be divided into as many `3`s as possible, then we will do that.
- If there is a remainder of `1` after dividing by `3`, instead of having a `1`, it’s better to combine this `1` with a `3` to make `4` (since `2 * 2 = 4 > 3 * 1`).
- Similarly, if there's a remainder of `2`, we can simply include it as is.

The general rules from this reasoning lead to:
- If `n` is divisible by `3`, we just take `3` to the power of `n // 3`.
- If `n % 3 == 1`, instead of taking `1`, we take one `3` less and add `4` (i.e., `3 * (3^(n // 3 - 1)) * 4`).
- If `n % 3 == 2`, we can include the `2` directly (i.e., `3^(n // 3) * 2`).

### Code Implementation:
Here is the Python code that follows the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 2:
            return 1
        if n == 3:
            return 2
        
        # When n is larger than 4, use 3s to maximize the product
        product = 1
        
        while n > 4:
            product *= 3
            n -= 3
        
        # Now n is either 2, 3, or 4
        product *= n
        
        return product

```

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution`, which is typical in LeetCode problems to encapsulate the solution methods.
2. **Method `integerBreak`**: This method takes an integer `n` as input.
3. **Base Cases**: 
   - If `n` is `2`, we return `1`, since `2 = 1 + 1`.
   - If `n` is `3`, we return `2`, since `3 = 1 + 2`.
4. **Loop to Maximize Product**: For `n` greater than `4`, we repeatedly subtract `3` from `n` and multiply `product` by `3`. This continues until `n` is reduced to `4` or below.
5. **Final Adjustment**: At the end of the loop, `n` will be either `2`, `3`, or `4`, and we simply multiply the remaining `product` by `n`.
6. **Return**: Finally, we return the `product`.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For `n = 10`: 
  - `10 = 3 + 3 + 4`, where the product is `3 * 3 * 4 = 36`.
- For `n = 8`: 
  - `8 = 3 + 3 + 2`, where the product is `3 * 3 * 2 = 18`.

### Conclusion:
This algorithm efficiently computes the maximal product for any integer `n` using principles from arithmetic. It runs in linear time relative to `n` due to the while loop, and it's structured properly to fit the LeetCode format for direct submission.

# 351. Android Unlock Patterns

### Problem Description 
Android devices have a special lock screen with a `3 x 3` grid of dots. Users can set an "unlock pattern" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of `k` dots is a valid unlock pattern if both of the following are true:
All the dots in the sequence are distinct.

If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through any other dot, the other dot must have previously appeared in the sequence. No jumps through non-selected dots are allowed.

Here are some example valid and invalid unlock patterns:
The 1st pattern `[4,1,3,6]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `3` pass through dot `2`, but dot `2` did not previously appear in the sequence.

The 2nd pattern `[4,1,9,2]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `9` pass through dot `5`, but dot `5` did not previously appear in the sequence.

The 3rd pattern `[2,4,1,3,6]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `3` meets the condition because dot `2` previously appeared in the sequence.

The 4th pattern `[6,5,4,1,9,2]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `9` meets the condition because dot `5` previously appeared in the sequence.

Given two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of unique and valid unlock patterns of the Android grid lock screen that consist of at least `m` keys and at most `n` keys.

Two unlock patterns are considered unique if there is a dot in one sequence that is not in the other, or the order of the dots is different.


Example 1:
Input: m = 1, n = 1
Output: 9

Example 2:
Input: m = 1, n = 2
Output: 65

Constraints:
`1 <= m, n <= 9`

### Solution 
 Certainly! Let's tackle the given problem with a detailed explanation and provide a solution formatted appropriately for LeetCode.

### Problem Explanation
The problem requires us to find the number of unique and valid unlock patterns using a 3x3 grid of dots where:
- Each pattern must consist of at least `m` dots and at most `n` dots.
- Each dot can only be used once in a pattern.
- If the line segment connecting two dots goes through another dot, that dot must have already been included in the current pattern.

### Solution Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   We'll use a backtracking approach to explore all potential patterns. The key to backtracking will be:
   - Maintain a set of visited dots to ensure all dots in the current sequence are distinct.
   - Check whether we can connect two dots directly or if it requires "jumping" over another dot that must already be visited.

2. **Valid Jump Conditions**:
   A connection between two dots `(x, y)` requires checking if:
   - If the jump passes through a third dot `(z)`, then `z` must be present in the pattern before making that jump.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   We define a recursive function that will:
   - Accept the current dot, the count of dots used, and the set of visited dots.
   - Explore all possible next dots that can be included in the pattern while respecting the previously mentioned rules.

4. **Counting Valid Patterns**:
   Start from each dot, and calculate valid patterns from lengths `m` to `n`.

### Implementation
Here's the Python code formatted to run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countPatterns(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Directions for possible moves, including jumps through a middle point
        jump = {
            (1, 3): 2,
            (1, 7): 4,
            (3, 9): 6,
            (7, 9): 8,
            (1, 9): 5,
            (2, 8): 5,
            (4, 6): 5,
            (3, 7): 5
        }
        
        def is_valid(from_dot, to_dot, visited):
            # Check if we need to jump
            if (from_dot, to_dot) in jump:
                middle = jump[(from_dot, to_dot)]
                return middle in visited
            return True

        def backtrack(current, visited, length):
            if length >= m:
                count[0] += 1
            
            if length == n:
                return
            
            for next_dot in range(1, 10):
                if next_dot not in visited and is_valid(current, next_dot, visited):
                    visited.add(next_dot)
                    backtrack(next_dot, visited, length + 1)
                    visited.remove(next_dot)

        count = [0]
        
        # Try starting from each dot
        for start in range(1, 10):
            visited = {start}
            backtrack(start, visited, 1)
        
        return count[0]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.countPatterns(1, 1))  # Output: 9
print(sol.countPatterns(1, 2))  # Output: 65

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **jump Dictionary**: This dictionary stores pairs of dots that require jumping over a third dot. For example, `1 -> 3` requires `2` to be visited first.
  
2. **is_valid Function**: This checks if the move from one dot to another is valid based on the jumping rules.

3. **backtrack Function**: This function recursively explores potential dots to add to the pattern and updates the count of valid patterns whenever the current length reaches or exceeds `m`.

4. **Main Logic**: We initialize a count and start backtracking from every possible starting dot on the grid.

This solution effectively counts all valid patterns from length `m` to `n` while complying with the rules provided in the problem statement.

# 354. Russian Doll Envelopes

### Problem Description 
You are given a 2D array of integers `envelopes` where `envelopes[i] = [wi, hi]` represents the width and the height of an envelope.

One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the other envelope's width and height.

Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

Note: You cannot rotate an envelope.


Example 1:
Input: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is `3` ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).


Example 2:
Input: envelopes = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= envelopes.length <= 5000`
`envelopes[i].length == 2`
`1 <= wi, hi <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of envelopes we can Russian doll (put one inside the other), we can use a combination of sorting and dynamic programming (specifically, the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm). 

### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the maximum nesting of envelopes. An envelope can fit into another if both its width and height are strictly smaller.

2. **Sorting**: The first step is to sort the envelopes. We can sort them primarily by width, and for envelopes with the same width, we should sort by height in descending order. This is crucial because if two envelopes have the same width, we cannot nest them within each other, and sorting by height in descending order will prevent us from considering these pairs when looking for the longest increasing subsequence.

3. **Finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence**: After sorting, we will focus only on the heights of the envelopes. We will apply the LIS algorithm on the heights of the envelopes, which gives us the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested.

### Steps to Implement the Solution

- **Step 1**: Sort the envelopes.
- **Step 2**: Extract the heights and find the longest increasing subsequence.

### Solution Code

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxEnvelopes(self, envelopes: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort envelopes
        envelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        
        # Step 2: Extract heights
        heights = [h for _, h in envelopes]
        
        # Step 3: Find the length of LIS on heights
        def length_of_lis(nums):
            dp = []
            for num in nums:
                # Binary search for the insertion point
                left, right = 0, len(dp)
                while left < right:
                    mid = (left + right) // 2
                    if dp[mid] < num:
                        left = mid + 1
                    else:
                        right = mid
                # If left is equal to length of dp, this num is greater than all
            
                if left == len(dp):
                    dp.append(num)
                else:
                    dp[left] = num  # replace with a smaller number
                
            return len(dp)

        return length_of_lis(heights)

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
envelopes_1 = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
print(solution.maxEnvelopes(envelopes_1))  # Output: 3

envelopes_2 = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
print(solution.maxEnvelopes(envelopes_2))  # Output: 1

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting**: We use Python's built-in sort function with a custom key that sorts by width and, in case of ties, by height in descending order.

2. **LIS Function**: The `length_of_lis` function implements binary search to efficiently find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of heights. We maintain a dynamic programming list (`dp`) that helps keep track of the smallest last elements of each increasing subsequence.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the length of the longest increasing subsequence, which corresponds to the maximum number of envelopes that can fit within each other.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Sorting takes O(n log n), and finding the LIS takes O(n log n) as well, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the heights and the `dp` array.

This algorithm efficiently solves the problem within the constraints provided.

# 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, `x`, where `0 <= x < 10n`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 91
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99

Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: 1

Constraints:
`0 <= n <= 8`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting all numbers with unique digits where \(0 \leq x < 10^n\), we can break down our approach as follows:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to count numbers that do not have any repeated digits.
   - The main constraint is defined by \( n \), which indicates that we are looking at all the numbers from \( 0 \) to \( 10^n - 1 \).

2. **Special Cases**:
   - For \( n = 0 \): The only number possible is \( 0 \), so we return \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \): The numbers are \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \) — 10 numbers in total.

3. **General Cases**:
   - For \( n \geq 2 \):
     - The total count can be derived based on how we construct the numbers with unique digits:
     - We can compute how many unique digit numbers can be formed for each length (from 1 to \( n \)):
       - For a number of length \( k \):
         - The first digit can be any non-zero digit (9 options: from 1 to 9).
         - Each subsequent digit must be different, chosen from the remaining digits (0 is allowed after the first digit).
       - The counting formula can be derived, using combinatorial principles.

4. **Plan**:
   - Start with known values for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - For each \( n \) from 2 to the input \( n \), calculate the number of valid numbers formed with unique digits.
   - Sum these counts to get the total.

Here is the Python code for the problem, formatted as per LeetCode's requirements:



```python
class Solution:
    def countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n == 1:
            return 10
        
        count = 10  # count for n = 0 and n = 1 combined
        unique_digits = 9  # choices for the first digit (1-9)
        available_digits = 9  # choices for the rest (0-9 without first digit)

        # Calculate for the numbers with lengths from 2 to n
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            count += unique_digits * available_digits
            unique_digits -= 1  # Decrement available choices for subsequent digits
            available_digits -= 1  # Last digit must be unique of remaining digits

        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function first checks if \( n \) is 0 or 1 and handles those cases immediately by returning 1 and 10 respectively.

2. **Counting Logic**:
   - Initialize `count` with `10` to count numbers for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \).
   - Set `unique_digits` to `9` (the first digit can take values from 1 to 9).
   - Set `available_digits` to `9` (the remaining digit choices for the subsequent digits).

3. **Loop Through Lengths**:
   - For lengths from 2 to \( n \):
     - Update the `count` by adding the product of `unique_digits` (number of choices for the first digit) and `available_digits` (remaining choices for subsequent digits).
     - After each multiplication, decrement `unique_digits` and `available_digits` accordingly to ensure unique digits.

4. **Return Count**:
   - Finally, return the accumulated `count` of numbers with unique digits.

The solution efficiently calculates the answer with a time complexity of \( O(n) \) and runs correctly for all valid integer inputs as per the constraints.

# 361. Bomb Enemy

### Problem Description 
Given an `m x n` matrix `grid` where each cell is either a wall `'W'`, an enemy `'E'` or empty `'0'`, return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. You can only place the bomb in an empty cell.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since it is too strong to be destroyed.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: grid = [["W","W","W"],["0","0","0"],["E","E","E"]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 500`
`grid[i][j]` is either `'W'`, `'E'`, or `'0'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to determine how many enemies can be killed by placing a bomb in an empty cell in a grid. The bomb will affect all enemies in the same row and column until it hits a wall ('W'). 

### Approach

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: We'll create two separate matrices (`row_counts` and `col_counts`) to keep track of the number of enemies in each row and column, respectively. Additionally, we'll need a matrix to keep track of where we encounter walls to halt the counting.

2. **Count Enemies**:
   - We'll iterate through each cell in the matrix. For every enemy ('E') encountered, we'll update our row and column counts in `row_counts` and `col_counts` arrays.
   - If a wall ('W') is encountered, we note that we need to reset the counts for that row and column from that point onward.

3. **Calculate Maximum Enemies for Each Empty Cell**:
   - For each empty cell ('0'), we can calculate the total enemies that can be killed if the bomb were placed there. This is done by summing up the corresponding values in `row_counts` and `col_counts`. We also need to subtract any double-counting of enemies that are in the same cell as the bomb placement (though there will be none in an empty cell).

4. **Return the Maximum Detected Value**: Keep track of the maximum number of enemies that can be killed across all empty cells.

### Implementation

The implementation of the above approach in Python that follows the LeetCode format is as follows:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxEnemies(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        row_counts = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        col_counts = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Count enemies in rows and columns
        for i in range(m):
            enemy_count = 0
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 'W':
                    enemy_count = 0  # Reset on wall
                elif grid[i][j] == 'E':
                    enemy_count += 1
                row_counts[i][j] = enemy_count
            
            enemy_count = 0
            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if grid[i][j] == 'W':
                    enemy_count = 0  # Reset on wall
                elif grid[i][j] == 'E':
                    enemy_count += 1
                row_counts[i][j] += enemy_count

        for j in range(n):
            enemy_count = 0
            for i in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'W':
                    enemy_count = 0  # Reset on wall
                elif grid[i][j] == 'E':
                    enemy_count += 1
                col_counts[j][i] = enemy_count
            
            enemy_count = 0
            for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
                if grid[i][j] == 'W':
                    enemy_count = 0  # Reset on wall
                elif grid[i][j] == 'E':
                    enemy_count += 1
                col_counts[j][i] += enemy_count

        # Find the maximum enemy count possible by placing the bomb in empty cells
        max_enemies = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == '0':
                    # Sum of enemies that can be killed from this empty cell
                    total_enemies = row_counts[i][j] + col_counts[j][i]
                    max_enemies = max(max_enemies, total_enemies)

        return max_enemies

```

### Explanation of the Code
- We initialize two matrices to count enemies row-wise and column-wise.
- We iterate through the grid twice: once to count enemies for rows and then for columns, taking care to reset the counts when hitting a wall.
- For each empty cell, we sum the row and column counts and check if it's larger than our current maximum. 
- The result is then returned as the maximum number of enemies that can be killed with a bomb placed in an empty cell. 

This solution efficiently manages to compute the necessary counts while respecting the constraints, ensuring it operates well within the provided limits.
