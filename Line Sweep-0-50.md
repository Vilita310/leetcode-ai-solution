# 218. The Skyline Problem

### Problem Description 
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:
`lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.

`righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.

`heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

Example 1:
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.

Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.


Example 2:
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]

Constraints:
`1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
`0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
`1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
`buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.

### Solution 
 Certainly! The skyline problem requires determining the outer contour of a collection of buildings represented by their left edge, right edge, and height. The solution employs the "sweep line" technique alongside a priority queue (or max heap) to manage and query the current heights of the buildings as the imaginary line sweeps from left to right across the x-axis.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Define Events:** We create two types of events for each building: one for when it starts (left edge) and one for when it ends (right edge). The start event will have a positive height, while the end event will have a negative height.

2. **Sort Events:** Sort the events. First by the x-coordinate; then by height in descending order (so that if two buildings overlap at the same x-coordinate, the taller building is processed first).

3. **Use a Max-Heap:** We maintain a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the active building heights. When encountering a start event, we add the height to the heap; for an end event, we remove the height from the heap.

4. **Track the Current Maximum Height:** As we process each event, we check the current maximum height. If it changes, we record a new key point in the resulting skyline.

5. **End Condition:** Ensure to add a terminator point at the last x-coordinate with height `0` to indicate the end of the skyline.

### Implementation:

Here's the complete implementation of the solution in Python, suitable for submission on LeetCode:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def getSkyline(self, buildings):
        # Create an array to store events
        events = []
        
        # Construct events for each building
        for left, right, height in buildings:
            events.append((left, -height))  # Start of a building
            events.append((right, height))   # End of a building

        # Sort events: first by x-coordinate, then by height
        events.sort()
        
        # Max-heap to keep track of heights
        max_heap = [(0, float('inf'))]  # (height, end coordinate)
        result = []
        prev_max_height = 0
        
        for x, h in events:
            if h < 0:  # Starting a building
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (h, x))
            else:  # Ending a building
                max_heap.remove((-h, x))  # Remove the height
                heapq.heapify(max_heap)     # Re-heapify after removal
            
            # Get current maximum height
            current_max_height = -max_heap[0][0]
            
            # If the height has changed, record the point
            if current_max_height != prev_max_height:
                result.append([x, current_max_height])
                prev_max_height = current_max_height
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Event Creation:** We create start and end events for each building by iterating through the `buildings` list.
- **Event Sorting:** The events are sorted so that we process left edges before right edges, and for ties, we prefer heights in descending order.
- **Using a Max-Heap:** We use a max-heap for the current heights. When a building starts, we add its height (as a negative value to simulate a max-heap using Python's min-heap).
- **Heights Update**: After processing each event, we check if the maximum height has changed. If it has, it's noted in the result.
- **Final Output:** The function returns `result`, which consists of the key points of the skyline.

This algorithm operates in \(O(N \log N)\) time due to sorting and maintaining the heap, where \(N\) is the number of events (twice the number of buildings). This ensures it efficiently handles the maximum constraints given in the problem.

# 391. Perfect Rectangle

### Problem Description 
Given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [xi, yi, ai, bi]` represents an axis-aligned rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is `(xi, yi)` and the top-right point of it is `(ai, bi)`.

Return `true` if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.


Example 1:
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4],[1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.


Example 2:
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,2,3],[1,3,2,4],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.


Example 3:
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[3,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because there is a gap in the top center.


Example 4:
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[2,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.


Constraints:
`1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 104`
`rectangles[i].length == 4`
`-105 <= xi, yi, ai, bi <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether a list of rectangles together forms an exact cover of a rectangular region, we need to establish a few key points:

1. **Total Area Calculation:** The sum of the areas of all individual rectangles must equal the area of the bounding rectangle formed by the outermost corners of all rectangles.

2. **Corner Count Validation:** Each corner (vertex) of the bounding rectangle should appear exactly once, while inner corners (the corners where rectangles overlap) should appear an even number of times (2 or 4).

3. **Bounding Rectangle:** To determine the outer bounding rectangle, we need the minimal x (left) and y (bottom) values and the maximal x (right) and y (top) values from the provided rectangles.

4. **Data Structure:** A dictionary or Counter can be used to count occurrences of corners, specifically the four corners of each rectangle.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the total area of the rectangles and detect the bounding rectangle.
2. Count the occurrences of each corner of the rectangles.
3. Verify the conditions mentioned above.
   - The total area of all rectangles should equal the area of the bounding rectangle.
   - There should be exactly four corners for the bounding rectangle that appear once, while other corners should appear an even number of times.

Here's the code that implements the solution:



```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def isRectangleCover(self, rectangles: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Calculate the total area and collect corner counts
        area = 0
        corners = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Variables to find the bounding rectangle
        min_x = float('inf')
        min_y = float('inf')
        max_x = float('-inf')
        max_y = float('-inf')

        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            area += (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)  # Calculate total area
            # Update bounding rectangle coordinates
            min_x = min(min_x, x1)
            min_y = min(min_y, y1)
            max_x = max(max_x, x2)
            max_y = max(max_y, y2)
            
            # Count corners
            corners[(x1, y1)] += 1  # Bottom-left
            corners[(x1, y2)] += 1  # Top-left
            corners[(x2, y1)] += 1  # Bottom-right
            corners[(x2, y2)] += 1  # Top-right

        # Step 2: Calculate area of the bounding rectangle
        bounding_area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)

        # Check if the total area matches the bounding area
        if area != bounding_area:
            return False

        # Step 3: Check corners frequency
        expected_corners = {
            (min_x, min_y),  # Bottom-left
            (min_x, max_y),  # Top-left
            (max_x, min_y),  # Bottom-right
            (max_x, max_y)   # Top-right
        }
        
        # Count the expected corners (should appear exactly once)
        for corner in expected_corners:
            if corners[corner] != 1:
                return False

        # Count corners that appear an even number of times (should be <= 4)
        for corner, count in corners.items():
            if corner not in expected_corners and count % 2 != 0:
                return False
            
        return True

```

### Explanation:
- **Area Calculation:** We loop through each rectangle to update the total area and count the corners.
- **Bounding Rectangle:** We keep track of the min and max coordinates to find the bounding box which must encompass all rectangles.
- **Corner Validity Check:** We verify that each corner of the bounding rectangle appears exactly once and that all other corners appear an even number of times.

### Edge Cases:
1. Handles situations where rectangles overlap or leave gaps.
2. Takes into account negative coordinate values as per constraint.
3. Efficient in terms of time complexity due to single pass for area and corner counting, and another check for validity, making it O(n).

This implementation can be run directly on LeetCode as a valid solution for the problem discussed.

# 850. Rectangle Area II

### Problem Description 
We are given a list of (axis-aligned) `rectangles`. Each `rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] `, where `(xi1, yi1)` are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `(xi2, yi2)` are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the `ith` rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all `rectangles` in the plane. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: As illustrated in the picture.


Example 2:
Input: rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
Output: 49
Explanation: The answer is 1018 modulo (109 + 7), which is (109)2 = (-7)2 = 49.


Constraints:
`1 <= rectangles.length <= 200`
`rectanges[i].length = 4`
`0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 109`
The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed `263 - 1` and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the total area covered by a set of rectangles that may overlap, we can use a computational geometry approach. The main idea is to handle the overlap correctly, avoiding double-counting areas that belong to multiple rectangles. 

We'll employ a sweep line algorithm, which is a common technique in computational geometry, to efficiently calculate the area covered by all rectangles.

### Steps to Approach:

1. **Event creation**: We'll treat each rectangle as two vertical events—one for the left edge and one for the right edge. The left edge will add an interval, and the right edge will remove an interval.

2. **Coordinate compression**: Since the coordinates can go up to \(10^9\), we will use coordinate compression or mapping to convert these coordinates into a smaller set of continuous integers.

3. **Sweep line processing**: We will 'sweep' through the x-coordinates, maintaining a data structure (like a sorted list or list of active intervals) to track the current intervals of vertical coverage as we process the events.

4. **Area calculation**: As we process the events, we will compute the total covered y-length from the active intervals at each x-sweep position and multiply it by the width of the x-intervals to get the area contribution from that segment.

5. **Modulo operation**: Finally, since the result can be large, every calculation will be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Python Code:



```python
class Solution:
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        events = []
        y_coords = set()
        
        # Prepare events for the sweep line
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            events.append((x1, y1, y2, 1))  # Start of rectangle
            events.append((x2, y1, y2, -1))  # End of rectangle
            y_coords.add(y1)
            y_coords.add(y2)

        # Sort events first by x, then by type (-1 should come before +1 at the same x)
        events.sort()

        # Coordinate compression for Y-coordinates
        y_sorted = sorted(y_coords)
        y_map = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(y_sorted)}
        
        # Active count of y-intervals length
        active = [0] * (len(y_sorted) - 1)
        last_x = events[0][0]
        total_area = 0
        
        def calculate_y_length():
            length = 0
            for i in range(len(active)):
                if active[i] > 0:
                    length += y_sorted[i + 1] - y_sorted[i]
            return length
        
        # Sweeping through the events
        for x, y1, y2, typ in events:
            # Calculate area for the segment from last_x to current x
            length_y = calculate_y_length()
            total_area += length_y * (x - last_x) % MOD
            total_area %= MOD
            
            # Update active intervals
            for i in range(y_map[y1], y_map[y2]):
                active[i] += typ
            
            last_x = x

        return total_area


```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We define a list `events` to store the start and end of rectangles along with their respective y-coordinates.

2. **Sorting**: We sort the events primarily by the x-coordinate and use the type of event (start or end) as secondary sorting criteria.

3. **Coordinate Compression**: We create a mapping from the actual y-coordinates to a compressed version which allows us to manage a smaller array of active intervals.

4. **Sweep Line Calculation**: As we process each x-coordinate, we call `calculate_y_length()` to determine the total y-length currently active and compute the area contribution based on the width (difference in x-coordinates).

5. **Updating Active Intervals**: We update the count of active y-intervals when we encounter a start or end event of a rectangle.

6. **Final Return**: At the end, we return the total area computed mod \(10^9 + 7\).

In this approach, we efficiently handle overlapping areas and take advantage of sorting and interval counting using an event-sweep technique, ensuring we operate within the constraints provided.

# 1229. Meeting Scheduler

### Problem Description 
Given the availability time slots arrays `slots1` and `slots2` of two people and a meeting duration `duration`, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration `duration`.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements `[start, end]` representing an inclusive time range from `start` to `end`.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]` of the same person, either `start1 > end2` or `start2 > end1`.


Example 1:
Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8
Output: [60,68]

Example 2:
Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 12
Output: []

Constraints:
`1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 104`
`slots1[i].length, slots2[i].length == 2`
`slots1[i][0] < slots1[i][1]`
`slots2[i][0] < slots2[i][1]`
`0 <= slots1[i][j], slots2[i][j] <= 109`
`1 <= duration <= 106`

### Solution 
 Sure! To solve the given problem of finding the earliest common time slot that is available for both people for a specified duration, we need to iterate over the time slots of both individuals and check for overlaps that can accommodate the required meeting duration.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Understanding Time Slots:** 
   - Each time slot is represented as `[start, end]` and means that the person is available from `start` to `end` inclusive.
   - For a meeting of `duration`, we need to check if we can find a common time slot where both individuals have at least `duration` minutes available.

2. **Iterating Through Slots:**
   - We'll use two pointers to traverse both lists of slots (`slots1` and `slots2`).
   - For each pair of slots, we will check if they overlap.
   - The overlap can be determined by checking:
     - The start of slot1 is less than or equal to the end of slot2.
     - The start of slot2 is less than or equal to the end of slot1.
   - If they overlap, we will then check if the duration of overlap is enough (i.e., `end_overlap - start_overlap >= duration`).

3. **Calculating Start and End of Overlap:**
   - The actual start of the overlap would be the maximum of the two starts, and the end of the overlap would be the minimum of the two ends.
   - If the overlap is valid (i.e., its length is at least `duration`), we can calculate the earliest start time of the meeting which would be `max(start1, start2)`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - If a suitable time slot is found, it is returned as `[start, start + duration]`.
   - If no slot can accommodate the duration, an empty list `[]` is returned.

### Python Code Implementation:
Here is a Python implementation that follows the above logic and is written in a LeetCode compatible format.



```python
class Solution:
    def minAvailableDuration(self, slots1: List[List[int]], slots2: List[List[int]], duration: int) -> List[int]:
        # Pointers for slots1 and slots2
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        # Sort the slots (not strictly necessary here as they are guaranteed to be non-overlapping)
        slots1.sort()
        slots2.sort()
        
        while i < len(slots1) and j < len(slots2):
            # Get the current slots
            start1, end1 = slots1[i]
            start2, end2 = slots2[j]
            
            # Calculate the overlap
            start_overlap = max(start1, start2)
            end_overlap = min(end1, end2)
            
            # Check if the duration can fit in the overlap
            if end_overlap - start_overlap >= duration:
                return [start_overlap, start_overlap + duration]
            
            # Move to the next slot in the list that finishes first
            if end1 < end2:
                i += 1  # Move pointer in slots1
            else:
                j += 1  # Move pointer in slots2
        
        return []  # Return empty array if no suitable slot is found

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `minAvailableDuration` takes three parameters: `slots1`, `slots2`, and `duration`.
- It initializes pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the two lists of time slots.
- It sorts the slots to ensure they are in increasing order, although the problem guarantees that no two availability slots of the same person intersect, rendering sorting somewhat unnecessary.
- Inside a `while` loop, we check for overlaps using the two slots indexed by `i` and `j`.
- If an overlap of sufficient duration is found, we return the start and end of the meeting.
- If no overlaps are found by the end of the search, we return an empty list.

This code is efficient and will run well within the constraints provided by the problem.

# 1272. Remove Interval

### Problem Description 
A set of real numbers can be represented as the union of several disjoint intervals, where each interval is in the form `[a, b)`. A real number `x` is in the set if one of its intervals `[a, b)` contains `x` (i.e. `a <= x < b`).

You are given a sorted list of disjoint intervals `intervals` representing a set of real numbers as described above, where `intervals[i] = [ai, bi]` represents the interval `[ai, bi)`. You are also given another interval `toBeRemoved`.

Return the set of real numbers with the interval `toBeRemoved` removed from `intervals`. In other words, return the set of real numbers such that every `x` in the set is in `intervals` but not in `toBeRemoved`. Your answer should be a sorted list of disjoint intervals as described above.


Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[0,2],[3,4],[5,7]], toBeRemoved = [1,6]
Output: [[0,1],[6,7]]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[0,5]], toBeRemoved = [2,3]
Output: [[0,2],[3,5]]

Example 3:
Input: intervals = [[-5,-4],[-3,-2],[1,2],[3,5],[8,9]], toBeRemoved = [-1,4]
Output: [[-5,-4],[-3,-2],[4,5],[8,9]]

Constraints:
`1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
`-109 <= ai < bi <= 109`

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of removing a given interval from a list of disjoint intervals, we need to consider several cases depending on the relationship between the intervals in our list and the `toBeRemoved` interval. The key idea is to iterate through existing intervals and adjust them as necessary based on overlaps with `toBeRemoved`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Initialization**: Set up an empty list to store the resulting intervals after the removal of the `toBeRemoved` interval.

2. **Iterate through intervals**: For each interval in the given list:
   - **No overlap**: If the interval is entirely before or after `toBeRemoved`, we add it directly to the result.
   - **Overlap**: If there is any overlap:
     - If the start of the current interval is less than the start of `toBeRemoved`, that part of the interval (up to the start of `toBeRemoved`) is valid and should be stored in the result.
     - If the end of `toBeRemoved` is less than the end of the current interval, adjust the end of the current interval to exclude the part that overlaps with `toBeRemoved`.

3. **Return Result**: After processing all intervals, return the resulting list.

### Code

Here’s the implementation following the steps outlined above:



```python
class Solution:
    def removeInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], toBeRemoved: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        start, end = toBeRemoved
        
        for interval in intervals:
            a, b = interval
            
            # Case 1: No overlap, interval comes before toBeRemoved
            if b <= start:
                result.append(interval)
            # Case 2: No overlap, interval is completely after toBeRemoved
            elif a >= end:
                result.append(interval)
            # Case 3: Overlap - adjust interval
            else:
                # If the current interval starts before toBeRemoved, add the left part
                if a < start:
                    result.append([a, start])
                # If the current interval ends after toBeRemoved, add the right part
                if b > end:
                    result.append([end, b])
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. The function `removeInterval` takes two parameters: a list of `intervals` and an interval `toBeRemoved`.
2. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the resulting intervals after processing.
3. We unpack `toBeRemoved` into `start` and `end` for easier reference.
4. We iterate through each `interval` in `intervals`:
   - For an interval that ends before `start` (`b <= start`), it does not overlap, so we add the entire interval to `result`.
   - For an interval that starts after `end` (`a >= end`), it also does not overlap; thus, we add it straightforwardly.
   - If there is any overlap:
     - We add the left part of the interval if it starts before `start`.
     - We add the right part of the interval if it ends after `end`.
5. Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the adjusted intervals.

### Test Cases

To test the solution, you can instantiate the `Solution` class and call the `removeInterval` method:



```python
# Example Usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.removeInterval([[0,2],[3,4],[5,7]], [1,6]))  # Output: [[0,1],[6,7]]
print(sol.removeInterval([[0,5]], [2,3]))                # Output: [[0,2],[3,5]]
print(sol.removeInterval([[-5,-4],[-3,-2],[1,2],[3,5],[8,9]], [-1,4]))  # Output: [[-5,-4],[-3,-2],[4,5],[8,9]]

```

These examples match the expected results and will run directly on the LeetCode platform.

# 1288. Remove Covered Intervals

### Problem Description 
Given a list of `intervals`, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

Interval `[a,b)` is covered by interval `[c,d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.


Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.


Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: intervals = [[0,10],[5,12]]
Output: 2

Example 4:
Input: intervals = [[3,10],[4,10],[5,11]]
Output: 2

Example 5:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,4],[3,4]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= intervals.length <= 1000`
`intervals[i].length == 2`
`0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5`
All the intervals are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of removing intervals that are covered by another interval from a list of intervals, we can follow a systematic approach by sorting and iterating through the intervals. The clear explanation of the approach we will use is as follows, along with Python code suitable for LeetCode.

### Approach:

1. **Sorting the Intervals**: 
   - Start by sorting the list of intervals based on their starting points. If two intervals have the same starting point, the longer interval (with a greater ending point) should come first. This helps us efficiently determine if an interval is covered by another as we traverse the sorted list.
 
2. **Iterate Through the Sorted Intervals**:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum end point of the last added interval (let's call this `max_end`).
   - As we iterate through the sorted intervals:
     - For each interval, check if its end point is less than or equal to `max_end`. If it is, that means it is covered by the last added interval and can be skipped.
     - If it is not covered, we update the `max_end` with the end point of this interval and count it as a valid interval.

3. **Return the Count of Remaining Intervals**.

### Python Code:



```python
class Solution:
    def removeCoveredIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort intervals by their starting point, and by their ending point in descending order if starting points are equal
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the count of remaining intervals
        count = 0
        
        # Step 3: Keep track of the maximum end point of the previous interval
        max_end = 0
        
        # Step 4: Iterate through the sorted intervals
        for start, end in intervals:
            if end > max_end:  # Only count this interval if it's not covered
                count += 1
                max_end = end  # Update the max_end to this interval's end
            
        # Step 5: Return the number of remaining intervals
        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Sorting (`intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))`)**: This sorts intervals first by start time in ascending order and, in the case of ties, by end time in descending order. The negation (`-x[1]`) ensures that longer intervals are prioritized when start times are equal.
  
- **Iterating through intervals**: As we go through each interval:
  - If the current interval's end time is greater than `max_end`, we increment our count because this interval is not covered by any previously counted intervals.
  - If the current interval is covered (its end time is less than or equal to `max_end`), we simply skip it.

- **Keeping track of count**: We maintain a counter (`count`) that tracks the total number of remaining intervals.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, followed by an O(n) traversal, making it suitable for the given constraints. The final count of remaining intervals is returned at the end.
