# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.


Example 1:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:
Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

Constraints:
`k == lists.length`
`0 <= k <= 10^4`
`0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
`-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
`lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.

The sum of `lists[i].length` won't exceed `10^4`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of merging `k` sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list, we can use a min-heap (or priority queue) for an efficient merging process. The general idea is to insert the head of each linked list into the min-heap. Then, we continuously extract the minimum element from the heap and add the next element from that linked list to the heap, until all elements have been merged.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown and the corresponding code:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Define a ListNode Class**: Since the problem involves linked lists, we first need to define a `ListNode` class to represent each node in the linked list.

2. **Create a Min-Heap**: Utilize the Python `heapq` module, which allows us to efficiently manage a priority queue.

3. **Initialize the Heap**: Start by pushing the head nodes of all linked lists into the heap. This allows us to access the smallest element at any time.

4. **Merge the Lists**:
   - Pop the smallest node from the heap.
   - Append this node to the merged linked list.
   - If the popped node has a next node, push that next node into the heap.
   - Repeat this process until all nodes have been processed.

5. **Return the Merged Linked List**: Finally, return the head of the new merged linked list.

### Python Code:

Here’s the complete Python code following the LeetCode format:



```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# Merge k sorted linked lists
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        # Define a min-heap
        heap = []
        
        # Populate the heap with the head of each linked list
        for index, l in enumerate(lists):
            if l:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (l.val, index, l))

        # Create a dummy node to simplify the merging process
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy

        while heap:
            # Get the smallest node from the heap
            val, index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            # Add this node to the merged linked list
            current.next = ListNode(val)
            current = current.next
            
            # If there's a next node in the same list, push it onto the heap
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, index, node.next))

        # Return the merged linked list, skipping the dummy head
        return dummy.next

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **ListNode Class**: This class defines a node in a singly linked list with a value `val` and a pointer `next` to the next node.
  
- **mergeKLists Function**:
  - We initiate a list `heap` to keep track of the nodes in sorted order.
  - We iterate over each linked list and push the head node into the heap if it exists.
  - A dummy node is used to simplify the process of building the new linked list.
  - We enter a loop where we continually extract the smallest node from the heap and add it to the merged list.
  - If the extracted node has a next node, we push this next node into the heap to consider it for merging.
  
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N log k)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes across all linked lists and `k` is the number of linked lists.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` for storing the heap, where `k` is the number of linked lists.

This structured approach allows us to efficiently merge the sorted linked lists, and the code provided follows the expected format for LeetCode submissions.

# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `kth` largest element in the array.

Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104`
`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the k-th largest element in an array, we will follow the typical format used in LeetCode solutions. We can utilize a straightforward approach by sorting the array and then accessing the appropriate index. However, for efficiency especially with larger lists, we'll also discuss a more optimal solution using a min-heap. 

Let's go through both approaches and provide the final implementation which can be directly used in LeetCode.

### Approach 1: Sorting the Array

1. **Sort the `nums` array in descending order.**
2. **Select the element at index `k-1`**, because array indices start from 0 and we want the k-th element.

#### Time Complexity:
- Sorting takes O(n log n) where n is the length of the array.
- Accessing the k-th element takes O(1).
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n).

### Approach 2: Using a Min-Heap

For a more optimal solution, especially when `k` is much smaller than the size of the list:

1. **Use a min-heap to keep track of the k largest elements.**
2. **Push each element onto the heap and maintain its size to k.** This means if the heap exceeds size k, we pop the smallest element off the heap.
3. **After processing all elements**, the top of the heap (the smallest of the k largest elements) will be the k-th largest element.

#### Time Complexity:
- Building the heap takes O(n log k), which is more efficient compared to sorting when k is small.
- Accessing the top of the heap takes O(1).

### Implementation

Here’s how the final implementation looks for both approaches. We’ll go with the min-heap approach as it is more efficient.



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Create a min-heap with the first k elements from nums
        min_heap = []
        
        for num in nums:
            # Add the current number to the heap
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
            # If the size of heap exceeds k, remove the smallest element
            if len(min_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # The root of the heap is the k-th largest element
        return min_heap[0]

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Importing heapq**: We need this module for heap operations.
2. **Class Definition**: Follow LeetCode's structure by defining a class `Solution`.
3. **Method Definition**: The method `findKthLargest` takes an integer list `nums` and an integer `k`.
4. **Min-Heap Construction**:
   - Loop through each number in `nums`.
   - Use `heapq.heappush` to add elements to the heap.
   - Check the size of the heap, and if it exceeds `k`, remove the smallest element using `heapq.heappop`.
5. **Return the k-th Largest**: After processing all elements, the root of the heap (`min_heap[0]`) is the k-th largest element.

### Conclusion

This implementation is efficient and works well within the provided constraints. You can run this code directly on LeetCode, providing the `nums` list and the integer `k` as inputs.

# 218. The Skyline Problem

### Problem Description 
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:
`lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.

`righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.

`heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

Example 1:
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.

Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.


Example 2:
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]

Constraints:
`1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
`0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
`1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
`buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the skyline silhouette of buildings represented by their coordinates, we can utilize a well-known algorithmic approach using a sweep line with a priority queue (or max heap). This method allows us to efficiently determine the y-coordinates (heights) of the skyline as we "sweep" from left to right across the buildings.

Here’s the step-by-step plan:

1. **Event Creation**: Convert each building into two events - one for the left edge (where the building starts, pushing its height) and one for the right edge (where it ends, removing its height).

2. **Sorting Events**: Sort these events. Left edges should be considered before right edges if they are on the same x-coordinate. In our sorting criteria, we want to ensure that when a left edge and a right edge coincide, the left edge comes first, but if both are left edges or both are right edges, we sort by height appropriately.

3. **Max Heap for Active Buildings**: Use a max heap (priority queue) to keep track of the currently active building heights. When we encounter a left edge, we add its height to the heap. When we encounter a right edge, we remove its height.

4. **Determine Key Points**: For each position as we process the events:
   - If the tallest building in the heap changes (i.e., the maximum height changes), it results in a new key point for the skyline.

5. **Output**: At the end, we will gather the key points and ensure the last point of the skyline ends with height `0` to signal the end of the skyline.

Let's look at the implementation:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def getSkyline(self, buildings):
        # Step 1: Create events for each building
        events = []
        for left, right, height in buildings:
            events.append((left, -height))  # start of a building
            events.append((right, height))   # end of a building
        
        # Step 2: Sort events. Sorting by x coordinate and if equal,
        # by height (left edges come before right edges if same x).
        events.sort()
        
        # Step 3: Initialize the max heap and result list
        result = []
        max_heap = [(0, float('inf'))]  # (height, end)
        
        # Step 4: Process the events
        for x, h in events:
            if h < 0:  # Starting point of a building
                # Push the height to max heap
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (h, x))
            else:  # Ending point of a building
                # Remove the height from max heap by marking it with an end point
                max_heap = [(h, end) for h, end in max_heap if end > x]
                heapq.heapify(max_heap)

            # Step 5: Check the current maximum height
            current_max_height = -max_heap[0][0]
            if not result or current_max_height != result[-1][1]:
                result.append((x, current_max_height))

        # Step 6: Preparation for final result with termination at height 0
        if result[-1][1] != 0:
            result.append((result[-1][0], 0))
        
        return result

# Note: The use of a custom heap structure to manage removals and additions efficiently ensures that we can run this within the constraints given.

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:
- We create a list named `events` to store start and end points of buildings with heights. The left edge (start point) is stored with a negative height to easily distinguish it when sorting.
- We sort the events primarily by the x-coordinate and secondarily by height (negated for starts).
- The `max_heap` maintains the current active building heights along with their right edges. It starts with a ground level height of `0`.
- For each event, we update the heap depending on whether we're starting or ending a building. If it’s a start, we push to the heap; if it’s an end, we filter it out.
- The current maximum height is checked against the last added point. If it changes, it indicates a new key point in the skyline.
- Finally, we ensure the skyline ends at height `0` to mark the end of the silhouette.

This implementation efficiently processes up to `10^4` buildings as required by the problem constraints and should run within the required performance limits on LeetCode.

# 239. Sliding Window Maximum

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,-1], k = 1
Output: [1,-1]

Example 4:
Input: nums = [9,11], k = 2
Output: [11]

Example 5:
Input: nums = [4,-2], k = 2
Output: [4]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
`1 <= k <= nums.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` in an array `nums`, we can use a deque (double-ended queue) to efficiently keep track of the indices of the elements in the current window. This allows us to maintain the order while easily adding and removing elements as the window slides.

Here is how we can approach the problem:

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   We need to initialize a deque `dq` that will store indices of the elements in `nums`. This deque will help us maintain the maximum element of the current window efficiently. We will also initialize a list `result` to store the maximums of each window.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   We will traverse each element in `nums` using a loop. For each element:
   - **Remove indices that are out of the current window**: If the index at the front of the deque is out of the bounds of the current window (i.e., older than `i - k`), we remove it from the deque.
   - **Maintain elements in decreasing order**: While the deque is not empty and the current element is greater than the element represented by the index at the back of the deque, we remove indices from the back of the deque. This ensures that the largest element's index stays at the front.
   - **Add the current index**: Append the current index to the deque.
   - **Store the result**: Starting from index `k-1`, we begin adding the maximum elements to our result list (the element at the front of the deque is always the largest in the current window).

3. **Return result**:
   Finally, we return the list containing the maximums for all sliding windows.

### Python Code:

Below is the implemented code in the LeetCode format:



```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        if not nums:  # Edge case: empty nums
            return []

        dq = deque()  # To store indices of elements in the current window
        result = []   # To store the result
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Remove indices that are out of the bounds of the current window
            if dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
                dq.popleft()

            # Maintain elements in decreasing order in the deque
            while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[i]:
                dq.pop()

            # Add the current index
            dq.append(i)
            
            # Starting from index k-1, we can start to record the maximums
            if i >= k - 1:
                result.append(nums[dq[0]])  # The front of the deque is the largest
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of Code:

- **Line 1-3**: Importing necessary modules and defining the class and method signature.
- **Line 4**: Check for edge cases where `nums` might be empty.
- **Line 6**: Initialize the deque `dq` for indices and an empty list `result` to store maximums.
- **Line 8-20**: Loop through each index `i` in `nums`.
  - **Line 10**: Check if the oldest index in `dq` is out of the window's range.
  - **Line 13-15**: Maintain the order in deque ensuring that all elements in `dq` are greater than or equal to the current element. Remove indices from the back if the current element is larger.
  - **Line 18**: Append the current index to the deque.
  - **Line 21**: Once we reach at least `k` elements, we start adding the maximum (front of `dq`) to the result list.
- **Line 22**: Return the collected results after processing all indices.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, making it efficient for large inputs (up to the constraint given).

# 253. Meeting Rooms II

### Problem Description 
Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.


Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
`0 <= starti < endi <= 106`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of conference rooms required for overlapping time intervals, we can utilize a greedy approach combined with a priority queue (min-heap) for efficient management of the end times of ongoing meetings.

### Problem Explanation
The idea is to track the end times of each meeting using a priority queue. Each time we encounter a new meeting interval:

1. If the heap is not empty and the earliest ending meeting (the minimum element of the heap) ends before or when the current meeting starts, then we can reuse that room. We pop from the heap, since that meeting room is now free.
2. Regardless, we push the end time of the current meeting onto the heap. This accommodates both the reuse (or lack thereof) of the room.

The size of the heap at any point in time will indicate the number of rooms currently in use, and the peak size will tell us how many rooms were necessary at any given time.

### Steps to Solution
1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Use a min-heap to keep track of the end times of meetings.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals, updating the heap based on the conditions outlined.

Here's the implementation that follows the LeetCode submission format:



```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Edge case: if there are no intervals, return 0
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        
        # Step 1: Sort the intervals based on the start times
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Step 2: Create a min-heap to track end times of meetings
        min_heap = []
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the sorted intervals
        for interval in intervals:
            # If the room due to the earliest finished meeting is free, remove it from the heap
            if min_heap and min_heap[0] <= interval[0]:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # Step 4: Add the current meeting's end time to the heap
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, interval[1])
        
        # Step 5: The size of the heap indicates the number of rooms in use
        return len(min_heap)

# Example Usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.minMeetingRooms([[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]))  # Output: 2
# print(sol.minMeetingRooms([[7,10],[2,4]]))             # Output: 1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if the `intervals` list is empty. If it is, the result is 0 (no rooms are needed).
- We sort the intervals based on their start times. This is crucial because it allows us to handle meetings in sequential order.
- We initialize a min-heap to store end times of the meetings currently in progress.
- For each interval:
  - We check if the room with the earliest end time is free (i.e., its end time is less than or equal to the start time of the current meeting). If it is, we remove this room (pop the heap).
  - We then add the current meeting's end time to the heap (push the end time).
- Finally, the number of rooms required at any time is represented by the size of the heap, and we return that.

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. This accounts for sorting the intervals and the operations on the heap.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of intervals in the worst case when all meetings overlap. 

This implementation can be run directly on the LeetCode website and will efficiently determine the minimum number of conference rooms needed.

# 264. Ugly Number II

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return the `nth` ugly number.

Ugly number is a positive number whose prime factors only include `2`, `3`, and/or `5`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.


Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 1690`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `n`th ugly number, we can use a method that employs a min-heap (or priority queue) to efficiently generate and track the ugly numbers. The idea is to start with the smallest known ugly number, which is 1, and then continuously generate new ugly numbers by multiplying the current smallest ugly number by the prime factors 2, 3, and 5.

Here's a detailed explanation of the approach we will take:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a list containing the first ugly number (which is 1) and a priority queue (min-heap) initialized with that value.

2. **Generate Ugly Numbers**:
   - We will repeatedly extract the smallest value (the next ugly number) from the heap.
   - After removing this value from the heap, we will generate new potential ugly numbers by multiplying it by each of the factors (2, 3, and 5).
   - We need to ensure that we only add unique values to the heap; to do this, we will also maintain a set of generated ugly numbers.

3. **Repeat Until N**: We repeat the extraction and generation process until we reach the `n`th ugly number.

4. **Return Result**: The last extracted value will be the `n`th ugly number.

Here is the complete Python code following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Min-heap to store the next potential ugly numbers
        heap = []
        # Set to keep track of seen ugly numbers
        seen = set()
        
        # Start with the first ugly number
        heapq.heappush(heap, 1)
        seen.add(1)

        # The variable to hold the current ugly number
        ugly_number = 1
        
        # Factors for generating new ugly numbers
        factors = [2, 3, 5]
        
        for _ in range(n):
            # Get the smallest ugly number
            ugly_number = heapq.heappop(heap)
            # Generate new ugly numbers by multiplying with 2, 3, and 5
            for factor in factors:
                new_ugly = ugly_number * factor
                if new_ugly not in seen:
                    seen.add(new_ugly)
                    heapq.heappush(heap, new_ugly)
        
        return ugly_number

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Imports**: We import the `heapq` module to use the heap data structure.

2. **Class and Method Declaration**: We define a class `Solution` with one method `nthUglyNumber` that takes an integer `n`.

3. **Heap and Set Initialization**: 
   - `heap` is a min-heap that will store the ugly numbers.
   - `seen` is a set that keeps track of numbers we've already added to avoid duplicates.

4. **Start with First Ugly Number**: We push the number 1 onto the heap and the set.

5. **Extracting and Generating Ugly Numbers**: We run a loop `n` times:
   - In each iteration, we pop the smallest number (the next ugly number).
   - For each factor (2, 3, 5), we multiply the current ugly number and check if it’s new. If it is, we add it to both the heap and the set.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop completes, the last value of `ugly_number` will be our answer, which we return.

This approach ensures that we efficiently generate the required ugly numbers and have O(log k) complexity for each insertion and extraction operation from the heap, where `k` is the number of unique ugly numbers generated. The overall complexity remains manageable within the given constraints.

# 295. Find Median from Data Stream

### Problem Description 
The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.

For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:
`MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.

`void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.

`double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.


Example 1:
Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]
Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

Constraints:
`-105 <= num <= 105`
There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.

At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

Follow up:
If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the median from a data stream, we can leverage two heaps (priority queues) to efficiently manage the incoming numbers. The idea is to maintain two heaps:

1. A max-heap to keep track of the lower half of the numbers (let's call it `low`).
2. A min-heap to keep track of the upper half of the numbers (let's call it `high`).

The max-heap will store the smaller half of the numbers in such a way that the largest number in the lower half can be quickly accessed. The min-heap will store the larger half of the numbers, allowing quick access to the smallest number in the upper half.

### Steps:

1. **Adding a Number**:
   - When a new number is added, we check where it should go:
     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (`low`), it belongs in `low`.
     - Otherwise, it belongs in `high`.
   - After adding the number, we need to balance the heaps:
     - If `low` contains more than one extra element compared to `high`, we move the max element from `low` to `high`.
     - If `high` contains more elements than `low`, we move the min element from `high` to `low`.

2. **Finding the Median**:
   - If `low` and `high` are the same size, the median will be the average of the maximum of `low` and the minimum of `high`.
   - If `low` has one more element than `high`, the median is simply the maximum of `low`.

### Implementation:

Below is the implementation encapsulated in a `MedianFinder` class as requested, following the format of a LeetCode solution:



```python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        # max-heap for the lower half (inverted to use as max-heap)
        self.low = []  # Max heap (inverted min-heap)
        # min-heap for the upper half
        self.high = []  # Min heap

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        # Add to max-heap (low)
        heapq.heappush(self.low, -num)
        
        # Move the largest element from low to high
        if self.low and self.high and (-self.low[0] > self.high[0]):
            val = -heapq.heappop(self.low)
            heapq.heappush(self.high, val)
        
        # Balance the sizes of the heaps
        if len(self.low) > len(self.high) + 1:
            val = -heapq.heappop(self.low)
            heapq.heappush(self.high, val)
        elif len(self.high) > len(self.low):
            val = heapq.heappop(self.high)
            heapq.heappush(self.low, -val)

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        # If the sizes are the same, average the tops of both heaps
        if len(self.low) == len(self.high):
            return (-self.low[0] + self.high[0]) / 2.0
        else:
            return float(-self.low[0])  # Max of low is the median

# Example usage:
# medianFinder = MedianFinder()
# medianFinder.addNum(1)    # arr = [1]
# medianFinder.addNum(2)    # arr = [1, 2]
# print(medianFinder.findMedian()) # return 1.5
# medianFinder.addNum(3)    # arr = [1, 2, 3]
# print(medianFinder.findMedian()) # return 2.0

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`__init__` Method**:
   - Initializes two heaps, `low` and `high`.

2. **`addNum` Method**:
   - Adds a new number to the `low` heap as a negative value to mimic a max-heap.
   - Ensures that the largest number from `low` does not exceed the smallest number in `high` and balances the heaps if necessary.

3. **`findMedian` Method**:
   - If both heaps are of the same size, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle values.
   - If one heap (`low`) has one more element than the other, it returns the top value of `low` as the median.

This approach ensures that both adding a number and finding the median are efficient operations, running in logarithmic time with respect to the number of elements being processed.

# 313. Super Ugly Number

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n` and an array of integers `primes`, return the `nth` super ugly number.

Super ugly number is a positive number whose all prime factors are in the array `primes`.

The `nth` super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.


Example 1:
Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
Output: 32
Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes == [2,7,13,19].


Example 2:
Input: n = 1, primes = [2,3,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 106`
`1 <= primes.length <= 100`
`2 <= primes[i] <= 1000`
`primes[i]` is guaranteed to be a prime number.

All the values of `primes` are unique and sorted in ascending order.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `nth` super ugly number using the given array of primes, we can utilize a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently track and generate the super ugly numbers. The super ugly number is defined as a positive integer whose prime factors are all contained in the given list of primes. 

Here are the steps to tackle this problem:

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first super ugly number, which is always `1`. We will maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to get the next smallest super ugly number efficiently. Additionally, we will use a set to keep track of the super ugly numbers we have already generated.

2. **Heap Operations**: For each super ugly number extracted from the heap, generate new numbers by multiplying it with each of the primes. These products are the potential next super ugly numbers. We can only add a product to the heap if it has not been added before (to avoid duplicates).

3. **Extraction and Generation**: Repeat the extraction process `n` times to generate the `nth` super ugly number. The first extraction gives the first super ugly number, the second gives the second, and so on until we reach the `n`th.

4. **Return Result**: After extracting the `n`th super ugly number, return that value.

Here’s how this logic can be implemented in Python:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def nthSuperUglyNumber(self, n: int, primes: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initial super ugly numbers list
        ugly_numbers = [1]
        
        # Min-heap to store the next potential super ugly numbers
        heap = []
        
        # Dictionary to store the next index for primes
        index = {prime: 0 for prime in primes}
        
        # Push the initial products into the heap
        for prime in primes:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (prime, prime))
        
        # Generate the super ugly numbers
        for _ in range(1, n):  # We already have the 1 as the first super ugly number
            next_ugly, prime = heapq.heappop(heap)
            ugly_numbers.append(next_ugly)
            
            # Generate the next super ugly number by multiplying with the current prime
            index[prime] += 1
            next_product = next_ugly * prime
            
            # Push the next product into the heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, (next_product, prime))
            
            # Avoid duplicates: only add products for primes at their respective indices
            # If the ugly number is already produced, insert again with the next index
            if index[prime] < len(ugly_numbers):
                new_value = ugly_numbers[index[prime]] * prime
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_value, prime))
        
        # The n-th super ugly number is the last one in the list
        return ugly_numbers[-1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by importing the `heapq` module, which provides the min-heap functionality we need.
- The `nthSuperUglyNumber` function initializes a list `ugly_numbers` starting with the first super ugly number, which is `1`.
- We create a min-heap to handle the next possible super ugly numbers and a dictionary called `index` to keep track of the current position in the `ugly_numbers` for each prime that we are generating.
- We then proceed with a loop that runs `n-1` times (since `1` is already counted). On each iteration, we extract the smallest super ugly number and generate new candidates by multiplying it with the primes.
- We maintain the iteration through the primes using the `index` dictionary, ensuring we do not create duplicates by checking if we've already handled a certain product.
- Finally, we return the last element from the `ugly_numbers` list, which will be the `nth` super ugly number.

This approach efficiently generates and tracks the super ugly numbers, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the constraints.

# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.legth <= 105`
`k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `k` most frequent elements in a list of integers, we can use a combination of a hash map (to count the frequency of each element) and a bucket sort technique to efficiently retrieve the top `k` elements based on their frequency.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we'll need to count how many times each element appears in the array. For this, we can use a dictionary (`Counter` from the `collections` module) that maps each element to its frequency.

2. **Bucket Sort**: Next, instead of using sorting (which would give a time complexity of O(n log n)), we can use bucket sort where we create buckets for each frequency. The index of each bucket will represent the frequency, while the elements at that bucket index will represent the numbers with that particular frequency.

3. **Collect the Results**: Finally, we'll iterate through our buckets from the highest frequency to the lowest and collect the top `k` elements.

This approach is efficient since we utilize O(n) for counting and O(n) for building the bucket, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).

### Implementation in Python

Now, let's implement this in a form that can be directly run on LeetCode.



```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
        frequency = Counter(nums)
        
        # Step 2: Create a list of buckets where index represents frequency
        # The maximum frequency can be at most len(nums)
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
        
        for num, freq in frequency.items():
            buckets[freq].append(num)
        
        # Step 3: Collect the k most frequent elements
        result = []
        # We go from the highest frequency to the lowest
        for freq in range(len(buckets) - 1, 0, -1):
            for num in buckets[freq]:
                result.append(num)
                if len(result) == k:
                    return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Import Statements**: We import `Counter` from `collections` for counting frequencies and `List` from `typing` for type hinting.

2. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` which is the required format for LeetCode solutions.

3. **Function Definition**: Inside the class, we define the method `topKFrequent` which takes `nums` (list of integers) and `k` (the number of top frequent elements to return).

4. **Counting Frequencies**: We create a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `nums`.

5. **Creating Buckets**: We initialize a list called `buckets`. The size of the buckets is `len(nums) + 1` to accommodate all possible frequencies (from 0 to `len(nums)`).

6. **Filling Buckets**: We iterate over the frequency dictionary, placing each number into the bucket corresponding to its frequency.

7. **Collecting Results**: We iterate from the highest possible frequency down to 1, appending elements from the buckets to the results until we have collected `k` elements.

8. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the list of the `k` most frequent elements.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the frequency counts and buckets. 

This approach efficiently retrieves the top `k` frequent elements while adhering to the specified constraints.

# 355. Design Twitter

### Problem Description 
Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user, and is able to see the `10` most recent tweets in the user's news feed.

Implement the `Twitter` class:
`Twitter()` Initializes your twitter object.

`void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId)` Composes a new tweet with ID `tweetId` by the user `userId`. Each call to this function will be made with a unique `tweetId`.

`List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId)` Retrieves the `10` most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user themself. Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.

`void follow(int followerId, int followeeId)` The user with ID `followerId` started following the user with ID `followeeId`.

`void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId)` The user with ID `followerId` started unfollowing the user with ID `followeeId`.


Example 1:
Input
["Twitter", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "follow", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "unfollow", "getNewsFeed"]
[[], [1, 5], [1], [1, 2], [2, 6], [1], [1, 2], [1]]
Output
[null, null, [5], null, null, [6, 5], null, [5]]
Explanation
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
twitter.postTweet(1, 5); // User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).

twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5]. return [5]
twitter.follow(1, 2);    // User 1 follows user 2.

twitter.postTweet(2, 6); // User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).

twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5]. Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.

twitter.unfollow(1, 2);  // User 1 unfollows user 2.

twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5], since user 1 is no longer following user 2.


Constraints:
`1 <= userId, followerId, followeeId <= 500`
`0 <= tweetId <= 104`
All the tweets have unique IDs.

At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `postTweet`, `getNewsFeed`, `follow`, and `unfollow`.

### Solution 
 To implement a simplified version of Twitter in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Data Structure**: We'll maintain a few data structures:
   - A dictionary to store tweets. Each tweet should be associated with the user who posted it and timestamp to keep track of the order.
   - A dictionary to maintain the following relationship between users. This will help in determining which users’ tweets a user can see in their news feed.
   
2. **Functions to Implement**:
   - `postTweet(userId, tweetId)`: This function will add a tweet to the dictionary for a specific user.
   - `getNewsFeed(userId)`: This function will retrieve the 10 most recent tweets for a specific user, including their own tweets and the tweets of the users they follow.
   - `follow(followerId, followeeId)`: This function will add a follow relationship between the two users.
   - `unfollow(followerId, followeeId)`: This function will remove the follow relationship.

3. **Ordering Tweets**: To get the recent tweets efficiently, we can use a list to keep track of the tweets for each user and sort or keep them in order by their posting time.

Here is how we can implement the `Twitter` class based on these ideas. This code is formatted to run directly on LeetCode:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

class Twitter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tweets = defaultdict(list)  # Maps userId to their list of tweets (tuple of (timestamp, tweetId))
        self.following = defaultdict(set)  # Maps userId to the set of userIds they are following
        self.timestamp = 0  # A simple counter to keep track of the order of tweets

    def postTweet(self, userId: int, tweetId: int) -> None:
        self.timestamp += 1
        self.tweets[userId].append((self.timestamp, tweetId))

    def getNewsFeed(self, userId: int) -> list[int]:
        # Get a list of all tweet tuples from the user and the users they follow
        tweet_list = []
        
        # Add own tweets
        if userId in self.tweets:
            tweet_list.extend(self.tweets[userId])
        
        # Add tweets from followed users
        for followee in self.following[userId]:
            if followee in self.tweets:
                tweet_list.extend(self.tweets[followee])
        
        # Sort tweets by timestamp in descending order and take the last 10 tweets
        tweet_list.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Return only tweetIds of the most recent 10
        return [tweetId for _, tweetId in tweet_list[:10]]

    def follow(self, followerId: int, followeeId: int) -> None:
        if followerId != followeeId:  # Users cannot follow themselves
            self.following[followerId].add(followeeId)

    def unfollow(self, followerId: int, followeeId: int) -> None:
        if followerId != followeeId:  # Users cannot unfollow themselves
            self.following[followerId].discard(followeeId)

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We utilize a `defaultdict` for tweets and following relationships.
   - `self.timestamp` is used to uniquely identify the order of tweets since there are no timestamps provided.

2. **Posting a Tweet**:
   - Each time `postTweet` is called, we increment the `timestamp` and store a tuple with the `(timestamp, tweetId)` in the user's tweet list.

3. **Getting the News Feed**:
   - We aggregate tweets from the user and the users they follow into a single list.
   - We then sort this combined list based on the timestamp in a descending order.
   - Finally, we return the list of the most recent 10 tweet IDs.

4. **Following and Unfollowing**:
   - The `follow` method adds followees to the follower's set.
   - The `unfollow` method removes the followee from the follower's set if they exist.

### Note:
This implementation assumes that the maximum number of users is manageable within the dictionary's bounds and that the lists of tweets won't exceed memory limits in Python. The solution is also designed to handle the constraints given in the problem efficiently.

# 358. Rearrange String k Distance Apart

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, rearrange `s` such that the same characters are at least distance `k` from each other. If it is not possible to rearrange the string, return an empty string `""`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aabbcc", k = 3
Output: "abcabc"
Explanation: The same letters are at least a distance of 3 from each other.


Example 2:
Input: s = "aaabc", k = 3
Output: ""
Explanation: It is not possible to rearrange the string.


Example 3:
Input: s = "aaadbbcc", k = 2
Output: "abacabcd"
Explanation: The same letters are at least a distance of 2 from each other.


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
`s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

`0 <= k <= s.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rearranging the string `s` such that no two identical characters are less than `k` distance apart, we can utilize a greedy approach with a priority queue (also known as a max heap). The key idea is to always place the most frequent character that can be used at that moment.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Count Character Frequencies**: First, we will count how many times each character appears in the string using a dictionary.

2. **Use a Max Heap**: We will store characters in a max heap based on their frequencies so that we can always access the character that has the highest remaining count. This will help us ensure that we are placing the most frequent characters first, minimizing the chance of running into issues with rearranging.

3. **Place Characters with Distance k**: We will use a queue to store the characters that have been used in the last `k` positions. This ensures that we do not reuse a character until it is allowed to by the distance constraint. After placing a character, we will decrease its frequency by one. If its frequency is still greater than zero, we will reinsert it into the heap after `k` iterations.

4. **Build Result String**: As we build our result string character by character, if we find that we cannot place a character (i.e., the heap is empty before we've placed all characters), then we return an empty string.

5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases such as `k = 0`, where any arrangement is valid.

### Implementation:

Here’s how we can implement the solution according to the format required by LeetCode:



```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def rearrangeString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k == 0:
            return s
        
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
        count = Counter(s)
        
        # Step 2: Create a max heap based on frequency
        max_heap = [(-freq, char) for char, freq in count.items()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        
        result = []
        queue = []
        
        while max_heap:
            # Get the character with the highest frequency
            freq, char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result.append(char)
            # Decrease the frequency
            queue.append((freq + 1, char))  # Decrease frequency (add 1 since freq is negative)
            
            # If our queue has reached size k, we can re-add the characters back to heap
            if len(queue) >= k:
                f, c = queue.pop(0)  # Get the first element in the queue
                if f < 0:  # If there's still frequency left, push it back into the heap
                    heapq.heappush(max_heap, (f, c))
        
        rearranged_string = ''.join(result)
        
        # If the length of rearranged string is not equal to the original string, it's impossible to rearrange
        return rearranged_string if len(rearranged_string) == len(s) else ""

```

### Usage:

The above code defines a class `Solution` with a method `rearrangeString`, which can be called with a string `s` and an integer `k`. The expected output will be either a valid rearrangement of the string or an empty string if such a rearrangement is not possible.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log m)`, where `n` is the length of the input string and `m` is the number of unique characters (which is at most 26 for lowercase English letters).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)` for the heap and the queue.

This approach is efficient and works well within the given input constraints.

# 373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

### Problem Description 
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in ascending order and an integer `k`.

Define a pair `(u, v)` which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Return the `k` pairs `(u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk)` with the smallest sums.


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]
Explanation: The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3], k = 3
Output: [[1,3],[2,3]]
Explanation: All possible pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,3],[2,3]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 104`
`-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109`
`nums1` and `nums2` both are sorted in ascending order.

`1 <= k <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding `k` pairs of integers, one from each of the two sorted arrays that yield the smallest sums, we'll use a min-heap (or priority queue). This is an efficient approach that allows us to generate the smallest pairs without needing to generate all possible pairs explicitly, which would be inefficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Priority Queue Approach**: We'll utilize a min-heap to store the pairs along with their sums. This way, we can always extract the smallest sum pair available.

2. **Initial Pair Creation**: We'll initialize the heap with pairs formed by taking the first element from `nums1` combined with all elements from `nums2`. We store these pairs in the heap along with their summed value.

3. **Heap Operations**: We'll repeatedly extract the smallest pair from the heap, which will give us the current smallest sum. After extracting a pair, we'll generate new pairs by moving to the next element in `nums1` (the same element in `nums2` can be used again until all elements in `nums2` have been paired with that element of `nums1`).

4. **Bounds Checking**: Since we need to ensure we only take up to `k` pairs, we will keep track of how many pairs we have generated.

5. **Output**: Finally, we will return the list of `k` smallest pairs.

### Implementation:

Here's the Python code to implement the above logic according to LeetCode standards:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kSmallestPairs(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Use a min-heap to store the pairs with their sums
        min_heap = []
        result = []

        # If either array is empty, return early
        if not nums1 or not nums2:
            return result

        # Initialize the heap with the first element from nums1 combined with each element of nums2
        for j in range(min(k, len(nums2))):  # Only need to consider first k elements of nums2
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[0] + nums2[j], 0, j))

        # Extract the minimum k pairs
        while k > 0 and min_heap:
            current_sum, i, j = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            result.append([nums1[i], nums2[j]])

            # Move to the next element of nums1 for the current j (nums2[j])
            if i + 1 < len(nums1):
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i + 1] + nums2[j], i + 1, j))
            
            k -= 1

        return result

```

### Explanation of Code:
- We define a `Solution` class and a method `kSmallestPairs`.
- We set up a min-heap (`min_heap`) and a result list.
- We begin by checking if either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty. If so, we return an empty list.
- We initialize the heap with the first element from `nums1` paired with all elements from `nums2`, keeping track of their indices.
- We then proceed to extract the smallest pairs from the heap, and generate new pairs by moving down the `nums1` array, until we have `k` pairs.
- We return the result once we have collected the required pairs.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of pairs we want to find. This is because we insert at most `k` pairs into the heap and each operation on the heap takes \(O(\log k)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(k)\) for storing the resultant pairs and the heap at any point can also grow to \(O(k)\).

This method is efficient and handles the input constraints well, allowing it to process large arrays effectively while adhering to the requirement of finding the smallest sums.

# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

### Problem Description 
Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, return the `kth` smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5

Constraints:
`n == matrix.length`
`n == matrix[i].length`
`1 <= n <= 300`
`-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109`
All the rows and columns of `matrix` are guaranteed to be sorted in non-degreasing order.

`1 <= k <= n2`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `kth` smallest element in a sorted `n x n` matrix, we can utilize a **min-heap** (or priority queue). The intuition behind using a min-heap is that since each row of the matrix is sorted, we can efficiently grab the smallest elements. 

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - We can start by pushing the first element of each row into the min-heap. This gives us access to the smallest elements in the sorted order.

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - Maintain a min-heap that stores elements as tuples of the form `(value, row_index, column_index)`. The `value` is the element's value, and the indices point to its position in the matrix.
   - We will extract the minimum element from the heap `k` times. After extracting the minimum element, we will push the next element from the same row into the heap (if there is a next element available).

3. **Result Extraction**: 
   - After `k` extractions from the heap, the last extracted element will be the `kth` smallest element.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(k log n)` where `n` is the dimension of the matrix, as each heap operation takes `O(log n)`. Thus, this approach is efficient for the problem constraints.

Here is the Python implementation of the described approach in the LeetCode format:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        # Min-heap to store the elements
        min_heap = []
        
        # Initialize the heap with the first element of each row
        for r in range(min(n, k)):  # Only need to consider at most the first k rows
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (matrix[r][0], r, 0))
        
        # Extract the smallest element k times
        for _ in range(k):
            val, r, c = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # If there is a next element in the same row, push it into the heap
            if c + 1 < n:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (matrix[r][c + 1], r, c + 1))
        
        # The kth smallest element will be the last popped element
        return val

```

### Key Points:
- **Heapq** module in Python is used for implementing the min-heap.
- We only iterate `k` times to find our result, making this solution efficient and suitable for the given constraints.
- The matrix indices are managed carefully to ensure we do not access elements outside the valid bounds.

This solution can be directly run on LeetCode and will effectively find the `kth` smallest element in an `n x n` sorted matrix.

# 407. Trapping Rain Water II

### Problem Description 
Given an `m x n` matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.


Example:
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]
Return 4.

The above image represents the elevation map `[[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]` before the rain.

After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.


Constraints:
`1 <= m, n <= 110`
`0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 20000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the volume of water that can be trapped in a 2D elevation map, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) along with BFS (Breadth-First Search). This approach allows us to efficiently identify the lowest boundary walls of the elevation map, which will determine how much water can be trapped in lower areas.

Here's a detailed explanation and the corresponding Python code.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We treat the elevation map as a grid where each cell has a height representing the height of a terrain. Water can be trapped in lower areas surrounded by higher areas.

2. **Using a Min-Heap**:
    - We use a priority queue to always process the lowest cell first. This helps in simulating how water flows and fills the lower areas surrounded by higher terrains.

3. **Initialization**:
    - Create a boolean matrix to keep track of visited cells.
    - Push all the cells on the boundary of the height map to the priority queue, as these will not trap any water.
  
4. **BFS Process**:
    - While there are cells in the priority queue, extract the cell with the lowest height. For each neighboring cell (up, down, left, right):
        - If the neighbor cell is lower than the current cell, water can be trapped. The amount trapped is the difference between the current height and the neighbor height.
        - Update the volume of trapped water and push the neighbor into the priority queue with the max height between the current cell and the neighbor.

5. **Edge Cases**:
    - Handle edge cases for very small grids, ensuring that we do not run out of bounds.

### Python Code



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def trapRainWater(self, heightMap):
        if not heightMap or not heightMap[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(heightMap), len(heightMap[0])
        visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
        min_heap = []
        
        # Add all the boundary cells to the min-heap
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 or i == m-1 or j == 0 or j == n-1:
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (heightMap[i][j], i, j))
                    visited[i][j] = True
        
        # Directions for neighbors (right, left, down, up)
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        trapped_water = 0
        current_max_height = 0
        
        while min_heap:
            current_height, x, y = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            current_max_height = max(current_max_height, current_height)
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                # Check bounds
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    # If the neighbor is lower than the current height, it can trap water
                    if heightMap[nx][ny] < current_max_height:
                        trapped_water += current_max_height - heightMap[nx][ny]
                    # Push the neighbor to heap with its height
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (heightMap[nx][ny], nx, ny))
        
        return trapped_water

```

### Key Points:
- The implementation uses a priority queue to manage which cells to process based on the smallest height first.
- The visited matrix prevents reprocessing cells and allows efficient boundary checking.
- The trapped water is calculated based on the height of the surrounding cells compared to the maximum height processed so far.

You can run this code directly on the LeetCode platform, following the problem statement and constraints, and it should work efficiently within the given limits.

# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

### Problem Description 
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.


Example 1:
Input:
"tree"
Output:
"eert"
Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.

So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.


Example 2:
Input:
"cccaaa"
Output:
"cccaaa"
Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.

Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.


Example 3:
Input:
"Aabb"
Output:
"bbAa"
Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.

Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of sorting characters in a string based on their frequency in decreasing order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Frequency**: Use a dictionary to count how many times each character appears in the string.
2. **Sort the Characters**: Sort the characters based on their frequency in decreasing order. If two characters have the same frequency, they can appear in any order relative to each other.
3. **Build the Result String**: Construct the output string based on the sorted characters and their frequencies.

Here is the implementation of the above steps in Python, presented in the required form for LeetCode:



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character in the string
        freq_counter = Counter(s)
        
        # Step 2: Sort the characters based on frequency (and lexicographically if frequencies are equal)
        # sorted will sort by frequency (using negative value to sort in descending order)
        sorted_chars = sorted(freq_counter.items(), key=lambda item: -item[1])
        
        # Step 3: Build the result string
        result = ''.join(char * freq for char, freq in sorted_chars)
        
        return result

# Example usage
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.frequencySort("tree"))  # Output: "eert" or "eetr"
# print(solution.frequencySort("cccaaa"))  # Output: "cccaaa" or "aaaccc"
# print(solution.frequencySort("Aabb"))  # Output: "bbAa" or "bbaA"

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**: We import `Counter` from the `collections` module, which will help us count the frequency of characters easily.

2. **Defining the Solution Class**: According to LeetCode standards, we define a class `Solution` and a method `frequencySort` that takes a single parameter `s` (the input string).

3. **Counting Frequencies**: We use `Counter(s)`, which returns a dictionary where keys are characters and values are their respective counts.

4. **Sorting**: We sort the items of the frequency dictionary. The `sorted` function is utilized with a key that sorts by the negative frequency (`-item[1]`). This way, Python sorts the characters in descending order based on their frequencies. The characters that appear the same number of times can appear in any order, as specified by the problem statement.

5. **Building the Result String**: We use a list comprehension to build the output string by repeating each character according to its frequency. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the characters into a single string.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the constructed result string which fulfills the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

This solution efficiently counts and sorts the characters based on their frequencies and constructs the desired output string. It adheres to the LeetCode submission format, making it ready for direct execution on their platform.

# 502. IPO

### Problem Description 
Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. 
You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.


Example 1:
Input: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.

             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.

             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.

             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.

             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

Note:
You may assume all numbers in the input are non-negative integers.

The length of Profits array and Capital array will not exceed 50,000.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing capital from a set of distinct projects given the constraints, we'll employ a greedy approach with a priority queue (min-heap and max-heap). This strategy is efficient and suits the problem requirements well, especially since the number of projects can be large (up to 50,000).

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Inputs and Problem Constraints**: 
   - We have `k`, the maximum number of projects we can undertake.
   - We have `W`, the initial capital.
   - We have two lists: `Profits` and `Capital`, where `Profits[i]` is the profit from project `i`, and `Capital[i]` is the capital required to start project `i`.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - The approach involves sorting the projects based on their required capital. This will help us efficiently determine which projects can be started given the current available capital.
  
3. **Using Heaps**: 
   - We use a max-heap to keep track of the profits of the projects that can be started with the current capital.
   - As we iterate through the sorted projects, we add projects to the heap based on whether we can afford them with our current capital.
   - Once we have chosen to undertake at most `k` projects, we keep extracting the highest profit project from the max-heap to maximize the capital.

### Implementation:

Below is the Python code that implements this logic. It follows the structure expected from LeetCode solutions.



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: int, W: int, Profits: List[int], Capital: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(Profits)
        
        # Create a list of tuples (Capital[i], Profits[i])
        projects = sorted(zip(Capital, Profits), key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Max-heap to store the profits of viable projects
        max_heap = [] 
        index = 0
        
        # Iterate up to k times to select the most profitable projects
        for _ in range(k):
            # While projects are affordable, add their profits to the max-heap
            while index < n and projects[index][0] <= W:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, -projects[index][1])  # We use negative for max-heap simulation
                index += 1
            
            # If there are projects we can take, pick the one with the maximum profit
            if max_heap:
                W -= heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Pop the project with the maximum profit
            else:
                # No more projects can be undertaken
                break
        
        return W

```

### Key Steps in the Code:
- We define a `Solution` class with a method `findMaximizedCapital`.
- We create a list of tuples with project `Capital` and `Profits`, and sort this list based on `Capital`.
- A max-heap is employed to track the profits of projects that we can currently undertake based on our available capital.
- We try to pick projects up to `k` times, each time choosing the project with the maximum profit.
- Finally, we return the maximized capital.

This solution effectively balances the constraints of having limited capital to start projects while maximizing returns through strategic project selection. The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\). The heap operations, which are \(O(\log n)\), are negligible in comparison.

# 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in ascending order, return `true` if and only if you can split it into one or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has a length of at least `3`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 104`
`-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
`nums` is sorted in an ascending order.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of checking whether an integer array `nums` can be split into one or more subsequences of consecutive integers with a minimum length of 3, we can use a greedy approach combined with a priority queue (or a simple dictionary in our case). The main idea is to maintain the count of short subsequences that can be extended as we encounter new numbers.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we can approach this problem:

### Approach:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the input array `nums`.

2. **Maintain Subsequences**: We need to keep track of how many subsequences can be formed that are either in progress or completed.
    - Use a dictionary to keep track of those subsequences and their respective counts.
  
3. **Iterate Through `nums`**: For each number in the array:
   - If it is part of an existing subsequence (i.e., we can extend a subsequence that ends with the previous number), then:
     - Decrease the count of that subsequence and either remove it from the dictionary or reduce the count.
   - If it cannot continue a subsequence, start a new subsequence of length 1 (and later potentially increase it).
   - Look ahead to see if we can form a valid subsequence of at least 3.
  
4. **Check for Completion**: After processing all numbers, check if all subsequences meet the requirement.

5. **Return Result**: If all checks are satisfied, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Implementation:

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def isPossible(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        count = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            count[num] += 1
        
        ends = defaultdict(int)  # To count valid subsequences' endings
        
        for num in nums:
            if count[num] == 0:
                continue
            
            # Trying to extend a subsequence
            if ends[num - 1] > 0:
                ends[num - 1] -= 1
                ends[num] += 1
            
            # Starting a new subsequence with the current number
            elif count[num] > 1 and count[num + 1] > 0 and count[num + 2] > 0:
                count[num] -= 1
                count[num + 1] -= 1
                count[num + 2] -= 1
                ends[num + 2] += 1
            
            else:
                return False
            
            count[num] -= 1
        
        return True

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We use `defaultdict` to simplify counting occurrences of each integer and managing subsequences.
- We iterate through each number in `nums`. For each number, we check:
  - If we can extend an existing subsequence by checking if `ends[num - 1]` (the count of subsequences ending at `num - 1`) is greater than zero.
  - If we cannot extend a subsequence but can start a new valid subsequence of at least length 3 using `num`, `num + 1`, and `num + 2`, we reduce the counts accordingly and increment our count tracking for `ends[num + 2]`.
  - If neither condition is satisfied, it means we cannot form a valid segmentation, and we immediately return `false`.
- Finally, if we process all numbers without issues, we return `true`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`, since we are essentially processing each number once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, mainly for the count and ends dictionaries.

This solution is efficient and fits within the problem constraints.

# 692. Top K Frequent Words

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.


Example 1:
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.

    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.


Example 2:
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.

Input words contain only lowercase letters.
Follow up:
Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the k most frequent words from a given list of words, we can break down our approach into several manageable steps. Here's a structured breakdown along with the complete Python code:

### Approach

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a dictionary (or a `Counter` from the `collections` module) to count the occurrences of each word in the list.
  
2. **Sort the Words**: To retrieve the k most frequent words, we can use a heap structure (specifically a min-heap). This allows us to efficiently maintain the top k words based on their frequency.
   
3. **Return Results**: Extract the words from the heap and format them according to the requirements (high frequency first and lexicographically sorted in case of ties).

### Detailed Explanation
1. **Counting Frequencies**: Using `collections.Counter` allows us to efficiently count words in O(n) time.
   
2. **Using a Heap**: To maintain the k most frequent elements, we can use the `heapq` library in Python. We construct a min-heap where the size will never exceed k. This allows us to easily pop the least frequent word from the heap when we encounter a new word with a higher frequency.

3. **Sorting**: Before returning the result, we need to sort the results based on frequency (in descending order) and then lexicographically for words with the same frequency.

### Python Code
Here is the code formatted to run on LeetCode:



```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each word
        count = Counter(words)
        
        # Step 2: Use a min-heap to keep track of the top k frequent elements
        # The heap will hold pairs of (-frequency, word) to enable sorting by frequency
        heap = []
        
        for word, freq in count.items():
            # Push the tuple with -freq to create a max heap in terms of frequency
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-freq, word))
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        # Step 3: Extract words and sort them
        # Since we want to return the results according to specified order,
        # We can sort the words contained in the heap.
        result = []
        while heap:
            result.append(heapq.heappop(heap))
        
        # Sort by frequency and, in case of tie, by word
        result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by (-frequency, word)
        
        # Return only the words in the correct sorted order
        return [word for freq, word in result][:k]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- `Counter(words)` creates a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the counts of each word.
- We maintain a min-heap by pushing negative frequencies to ensure the most frequent words are on top.
- After constructing the heap, we extract elements and sort them. The sorting is based on two criteria: negative frequency (to sort from highest) and the word (to sort lexicographically).
- Finally, we return the top k words after extracting from the sorted list.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where n is the number of words. Counting frequencies takes O(n), and maintaining the heap takes O(log k) for each of the unique n words.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store the frequencies and the heap.

# 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

### Problem Description 
Design a class to find the `kth` largest element in a stream. Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Implement `KthLargest` class:
`KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of integers `nums`.

`int add(int val)` Returns the element representing the `kth` largest element in the stream.


Example 1:
Input
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
Explanation
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= 104`
`0 <= nums.length <= 104`
`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
`-104 <= val <= 104`
At most `104` calls will be made to `add`.

It is guaranteed that there will be at least `k` elements in the array when you search for the `kth` element.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `kth` largest element in a stream of integers, we can design a class named `KthLargest`. The main components of this problem involve initializing the class with a given list of integers and a value `k`, and defining a method to add new integers to the list while continuing to provide the `kth` largest element.

### Explanation of the Solution

We will use a min-heap to keep track of the largest `k` elements in the stream:
- The min-heap will store the largest `k` elements, such that the smallest of them (which is at the root of the heap) will be the `kth` largest element.
- When we add a new integer:
  - If the size of the heap is less than `k`, we simply add the new integer.
  - If the size of the heap is `k`, we check if the new integer is larger than the smallest element in the heap (the root). If it is, we replace the root with the new integer.
  
### Detailed Implementation

Here’s how the implementation is structured according to the problem specifications:

1. **Class Initialization**: `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)`
   - A `min-heap` is initialized.
   - We add all the integers in `nums` to the heap, ensuring it keeps at most `k` elements.

2. **Adding New Elements**: `int add(int val)`
   - If less than `k` elements are in the heap, the value is added to the heap.
   - If already `k` elements are in the heap, we compare `val` with the smallest element in the heap:
     - If `val` is larger, we remove the smallest and add `val`.
   - We then return the root of the heap which represents the `kth` largest element.

### Python Code

Here’s the Python code following the LeetCode format:



```python
import heapq

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: list[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.min_heap = []
        
        # Add initial numbers to the min-heap
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)  # Use the add method to ensure we maintain the size of the heap

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        # Add the new value to the min-heap
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        
        # If the heap exceeds size k, remove the smallest element
        if len(self.min_heap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
        
        # Return the kth largest element, which is the smallest element in the min-heap
        return self.min_heap[0]

# Example usage
# kthLargest = KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2])
# print(kthLargest.add(3))  # returns 4
# print(kthLargest.add(5))  # returns 5
# print(kthLargest.add(10)) # returns 5
# print(kthLargest.add(9))  # returns 8
# print(kthLargest.add(4))  # returns 8

```

### How This Code Works
- The `__init__` method initializes the `KthLargest` object and populates the min-heap using the `add` method to ensure that it correctly maintains the size of at most `k` elements.
- The `add` method handles inserting new values into the heap while ensuring that the min-heap does not exceed `k` elements. It also maintains efficient retrieval of the `kth` largest element.

### Performance
This solution is efficient because:
- Both adding an element and retrieving the `kth` largest element are done in logarithmic time due to the properties of the heap (O(log k) for insertion and O(1) for retrieving the top element).
- The overall space complexity is O(k) since at most `k` elements are stored in the heap.

# 719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B. 

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1
Output: 0 
Explanation:
Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.

Note:
`2 <= len(nums) <= 10000`.

`0 <= nums[i] < 1000000`.

`1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the k-th smallest distance among all pairs of integers in an array, we can utilize a binary search methodology over the potential minimum distances. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation on how we will achieve this, followed by the code formatted to be run directly on the LeetCode platform.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Distances**:
   The distance between two integers A and B is defined as |A - B|. Given an array of integers, we need to consider all possible pairs (i, j) where i < j to calculate their distances.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   If we sort the array, distances between the numbers become easier to calculate. This is because for any two indices `i < j` after sorting, the distance is simply `nums[j] - nums[i]`.

3. **Binary Search Setup**:
   We will perform a binary search on the possible values of distances from `0` (the minimum possible distance) to `max_dist = max(nums) - min(nums)` (the maximum possible distance). The idea is to determine the smallest distance for which there are at least `k` pairs.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   For each candidate distance during our binary search, we will count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to this candidate. This can be accomplished using a two-pointer technique:
   - For a fixed starting point (`i`), move the second pointer (`j`) until the distance condition is violated.
   - Count valid pairs between these two indices.

5. **Binary Search Execution**:
   If there are at least `k` pairs with the current distance, we lower the maximum distance to search for potentially smaller distances. Otherwise, we increase the minimum distance limit.

6. **Final Output**:
   The process continues until the binary search narrows down to the exact k-th smallest distance.

### Python Code:

Here’s the implementation of the above logic in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        
        # Helper function to count pairs with distance <= mid
        def count_pairs(mid):
            count, left = 0, 0
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                while left < right and nums[right] - nums[left] > mid:
                    left += 1
                count += right - left
            return count
        
        # Step 2: Binary search for the k-th smallest distance
        left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if count_pairs(mid) < k:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
                
        # When left meets right, we have found the k-th smallest distance
        return left


```

### Key Points:

- The `count_pairs` function efficiently counts valid pairs by iterating over the sorted array with a two-pointer approach.
- The main logic implements a binary search over the range of possible distances.
- The solution successfully handles the constraints provided in the problem and is efficient for the maximum input sizes.

You can copy this code directly into the LeetCode platform, and it should work as expected! Make sure to import `List` from `typing` if necessary, depending on the LeetCode environment.

# 743. Network Delay Time

### Problem Description 
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= n <= 100`
`1 <= times.length <= 6000`
`times[i].length == 3`
`1 <= ui, vi <= n`
`ui != vi`
`0 <= wi <= 100`
All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining how long it will take for a signal to reach all nodes in a directed graph, we can utilize Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Graph Representation**: We will represent the directed graph using an adjacency list. Each node will map to a list of tuples representing its neighboring nodes and the associated travel times.
  
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: We will implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue (min-heap) to dynamically get the node with the smallest travel time and propagate the signal through the network. 

3. **Keeping Track of Times**: We will maintain an array to track the shortest time to reach each node. If we reach a node with a shorter time than previously recorded, we update the time and push the corresponding entry into the priority queue.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all reachable nodes, we will check if we were able to reach all `n` nodes. If any of them remain at an initial "infinity" value (indicating they are unreachable), we will return `-1`. Otherwise, we will return the maximum time from the source node to all others.

### LeetCode Solution Format

Here is how the solution looks in the required format:



```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Build the graph
        graph = {}
        for u, v, w in times:
            if u not in graph:
                graph[u] = []
            graph[u].append((v, w))

        # Step 2: Initialize the priority queue and distances
        pq = [(0, k)]  # (time, node)
        distances = {i: float('inf') for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        distances[k] = 0

        # Step 3: Dijkstra's algorithm
        while pq:
            time, node = heapq.heappop(pq)

            if time > distances[node]:
                continue
            
            for neighbor, travel_time in graph.get(node, []):
                new_time = time + travel_time
                if new_time < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = new_time
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_time, neighbor))

        # Step 4: Check if all nodes were reached
        max_time = max(distances.values())
        return max_time if max_time < float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.networkDelayTime([[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], 4, 2))  # Output: 2

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Representation**: We build a directed graph using a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of tuples containing destination nodes and their respective travel times.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: We initialize a priority queue with the starting node `k` and a distance dictionary that holds the shortest distances to each node, initialized to infinity except for the starting node `k`, which is set to `0`.

3. **Heap Operations**: The main loop pops the node with the minimum distance from the queue. It checks all neighboring nodes, updating their distances if a shorter path is found and pushing those neighbors onto the priority queue.

4. **Final Check**: After all reachable nodes have been processed, we collect the maximum distance value. If it remains as infinity, it indicates that not all nodes are reachable, and we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the maximum time taken to reach all nodes.

This algorithm efficiently computes the desired result in O((V + E) log V) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, making it suitable for the given constraints.

# 759. Employee Free Time

### Problem Description 
We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.


Example 1:
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].

We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.


Example 2:
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]

Constraints:
`1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
`0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the common free time intervals for a list of employees, we can utilize a merging technique. Each employee has a schedule of working intervals, and our goal is to identify the gaps (free time intervals) where no employees are working.

The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Flattening the Schedule**: Combine all employee's working intervals into a single list for easier handling.
2. **Sorting**: Sort this list based on the starting times of the intervals. This helps in merging overlapping intervals efficiently.
3. **Merging Intervals**: We can then iterate through the sorted intervals to merge them to find the occupied intervals.
4. **Finding Free Time**: Finally, we calculate the gaps between these merged intervals to determine the free time.

Let’s implement the solution using these steps in Python following the LeetCode format:



```python
# Definition for an interval.
class Interval:
    def __init__(self, start=0, end=0):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end

class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule: List[List[Interval]]) -> List[Interval]:
        # Step 1: Flatten the schedule
        intervals = []
        for employee in schedule:
            for interval in employee:
                intervals.append(interval)

        # Step 2: Sort the intervals based on start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)

        # Step 3: Merge intervals to find occupied time
        merged_intervals = []
        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged_intervals or merged_intervals[-1].end < interval.start:
                merged_intervals.append(interval)
            else:
                merged_intervals[-1].end = max(merged_intervals[-1].end, interval.end)

        # Step 4: Find free time intervals
        free_time = []
        for i in range(1, len(merged_intervals)):
            prev_end = merged_intervals[i - 1].end
            current_start = merged_intervals[i].start
            if prev_end < current_start:  # There is a gap
                free_time.append(Interval(prev_end, current_start))

        return free_time

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Class Definition**:
   - `Interval`: A simple class to define an interval with `start` and `end`.
   - `Solution`: Contains the main function `employeeFreeTime`.

2. **Flattening the Schedule**:
   - We iterate through each employee's schedule and collect all intervals into a single list `intervals`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - We sort the intervals based on their `start` time using a lambda function. This allows us to process them in a chronological order.

4. **Merging Intervals**:
   - We initialize an empty list `merged_intervals`.
   - For each interval in the sorted list:
     - If `merged_intervals` is empty or the last merged interval ends before the current interval starts, it means there's no overlap, so we can safely add the current interval.
     - If there's an overlap, we merge by updating the `end` of the last interval in `merged_intervals`.

5. **Finding Free Time**:
   - We go through the `merged_intervals` to find gaps:
     - For each pair of consecutive merged intervals, we check if there's a free period (`prev_end < current_start`).
     - If so, we create an `Interval` for this free time and append it to `free_time`.

6. **Return the Free Time Intervals**:
   - Finally, we return the list of free time intervals.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to sorting, where N is the total number of intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the merged intervals.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the problem constraints, ensuring that it runs within acceptable limits on LeetCode.

# 767. Reorganize String

### Problem Description 
Given a string `S`, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.

If possible, output any possible result.  If not possible, return the empty string.


Example 1:
Input: S = "aab"
Output: "aba"

Example 2:
Input: S = "aaab"
Output: ""
Note:
`S` will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range `[1, 500]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rearranging a string such that no two adjacent characters are the same, we can take the following approach:

1. **Count Character Frequencies**: First, we need to count the frequency of each character in the string `S`. This will help us understand how many of each character we have.

2. **Use a Max Heap**: We can utilize a max heap (priority queue) to always prioritize the character with the highest remaining frequency. This is because using the most frequent characters first reduces the chances of having adjacent duplicates.

3. **Rearrangement Logic**:
   - We pop the character with the highest frequency from the heap and append it to our result.
   - We keep track of the last used character and its frequency. If we can use it again (i.e., if there are more of that character), we add it back to the heap after we place a different character next.
   - If we ever find ourselves in a situation where we cannot place any characters (e.g., only one character left and its frequency is greater than the remaining spots), then it is impossible to rearrange the string without adjacent duplicates.

4. **Final Check**: After we have constructed the result, we should verify if its length matches the original string `S`. If not, we return an empty string.

Here’s the code that implements the above approach:



```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, S: str) -> str:
        # Count frequencies of characters in S
        freq_map = Counter(S)
        max_heap = []
        
        # Create a max heap based on the frequency of characters
        for char, freq in freq_map.items():
            # Use negative frequency to simulate a max heap
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-freq, char))
        
        result = []
        prev_freq, prev_char = 0, ''
        
        # Arrange the characters in the result list
        while max_heap:
            # Get the most frequent character
            freq, char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result.append(char)  # Add current char to the result
            
            # If there was a previous character stored, push it back into the heap
            if prev_freq < 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (prev_freq, prev_char))
            
            # Update the previous character and its frequency
            prev_freq = freq + 1  # decrease frequency
            prev_char = char
        
        # Join the result and check if it's valid
        result_string = ''.join(result)
        if len(result_string) != len(S):
            return ""  # return empty string if rearrangement is not possible
        return result_string

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Import Statements**:
   - `heapq` is imported for using a heap (priority queue).
   - `Counter` from `collections` is used to count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - We create a frequency map using `Counter(S)` to get the count of each character.

3. **Max Heap Construction**:
   - We push each character with its frequency (as a negative to simulate max heap behavior) into the heap.

4. **Building the Result**:
   - We repeatedly pop the highest frequency character from the heap, append it to the result list, and manage the previous character that was used to ensure no adjacent duplicates occur.
   - If the previous character still has remaining frequency, we push it back into the heap.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After constructing the result string, we check if its length matches the input string `S`.
   - If the length matches, we return the result string; otherwise, we return an empty string indicating that it was impossible to rearrange the characters as required.

This solution runs efficiently and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 778. Swim in Rising Water

### Problem Description 
On an N x N `grid`, each square `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i,j)`.

Now rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square `(0, 0)`. What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square `(N-1, N-1)`?

Example 1:
Input: [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time `0`, you are in grid location `(0, 0)`.

You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point `(1, 1)` until time `3`.

When the depth of water is `3`, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.


Example 2:
Input: [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation:
 0  1  2  3  4
24 23 22 21  5
12 13 14 15 16
11 17 18 19 20
10  9  8  7  6
The final route is marked in bold.

We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

Note:
`2 <= N <= 50`.

grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the least time until you can swim from the top-left square `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right square `(N-1, N-1)` in an N x N grid representing elevations, we can utilize a combination of priority queue (min-heap) and breadth-first search (BFS) techniques.

The main idea is to treat this problem as finding the minimal "maximum elevation" we have to navigate through while reaching the target cell. We can achieve this using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm, where instead of distances, we're looking at elevations as weights.

### Detailed Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We start at position `(0, 0)` and need to reach `(N-1, N-1)`.
   - We can swim to an adjacent cell if the elevation of that cell is less than or equal to the current water depth `t`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum time `t` at which we can reach the destination.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - We'll use a priority queue (min-heap) to always explore the cell with the lowest elevation needed to swim to the next cell.
   - A 2D list to keep track of the visited cells to avoid revisiting.

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Push the starting cell `(0, 0)` with its elevation to the priority queue.
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Extract the cell with the smallest elevation from the queue.
     - If this cell is our target `(N-1, N-1)`, return the elevation (this indicates the minimum time `t` required).
     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check the corresponding cell:
       - If the cell is within bounds and has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and push it into the priority queue with the higher of the current cell’s elevation and the next cell's elevation.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(N^2 log N), where N is the dimension of the grid, due to the priority queue operations.

### Implementation Code:


```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(grid)
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        
        min_heap = []
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (grid[0][0], 0, 0))  # (elevation, x, y)
        visited = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
        visited[0][0] = True
        
        while min_heap:
            elevation, x, y = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # If we reach the bottom-right corner, return the elevation
            if x == N - 1 and y == N - 1:
                return elevation
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                
                if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    # Push the maximum of the current elevation and the next elevation
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (max(elevation, grid[nx][ny]), nx, ny))

```

### Execution:

This code can be pasted directly into the LeetCode interface for the problem "Swim in Rising Water". It should function correctly and outputs the least time `t` needed to swim from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.

# 786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction

### Problem Description 
You are given a sorted integer array `arr` containing `1` and prime numbers, where all the integers of `arr` are unique. You are also given an integer `k`.

For every `i` and `j` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`, we consider the fraction `arr[i] / arr[j]`.

Return the `kth` smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size `2`, where `answer[0] == arr[i]` and `answer[1] == arr[j]`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3
Output: [2,5]
Explanation: The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3.

The third fraction is 2/5.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,7], k = 1
Output: [1,7]

Constraints:
`2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 3 * 104`
`arr[0] == 1`
`arr[i]` is a prime number for `i > 0`.

All the numbers of `arr` are unique and sorted in strictly increasing order.

`1 <= k <= arr.length * (arr.length - 1) / 2`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the k-th smallest fraction from a sorted array containing unique integers consisting of 1 and prime numbers, we can take a systematic approach utilizing a max-heap. This will allow us to efficiently select the k-th smallest fraction without generating all the possible fractions explicitly.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Fractions**:
   - We are interested in fractions of the form `arr[i] / arr[j]` where `i < j`. This means we need to generate fractions using the elements of the input array.

2. **Using a Max-Heap**:
   - We can utilize a max-heap to keep track of the k smallest fractions. The reason we use a max-heap is that it allows us to efficiently remove the largest element when we exceed size k.

3. **Generating Fractions Efficiently**:
   - Instead of generating all fractions first, we can iterate through the array pairs `(arr[i], arr[j])` and maintain the heap with fractions sorted by their value. 
   - We insert the fractions into the heap and only keep the k smallest fractions.

4. **Returning the k-th Fraction**:
   - Once we have processed k fractions in our heap, the largest fraction in the heap will be the k-th smallest fraction.

### Implementation

Here's how the above plan translates into Python code:



```python
import heapq

def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(arr, k):
    # Max heap for storing fractions as (-numerator, denominator, left index)
    max_heap = []
    
    # We iterate through the array and calculate fractions
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n - 1):  # i < j means we go only up to n-2
        for j in range(i + 1, n):  # j starts from i + 1
            # Compute the fraction arr[i] / arr[j]
            fraction = (arr[i], arr[j])  # Store as a tuple (numerator, denominator)
            # Use negative of the divided value for max-heap
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-arr[i] / arr[j], fraction))
            # If we exceed size k, remove largest fraction
            if len(max_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)

    # The top of the max-heap is the kth smallest fraction
    _, result = max_heap[0]
    return list(result)

# Example Usage
print(kthSmallestPrimeFraction([1,2,3,5], 3))  # Output: [2, 5]
print(kthSmallestPrimeFraction([1,7], 1))      # Output: [1, 7]

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Heap Initialization**:
   - We create a max-heap and you'll notice we push the negative of the fraction values into the heap to replicate the max-heap behavior using Python's min-heap.

2. **Iterate through Possible Fractions**:
   - We loop through the array with a nested loop. For each pair `(arr[i], arr[j])`, we calculate the fraction `arr[i] / arr[j]` and push it onto the heap.

3. **Limit the Size of the Heap**:
   - If the heap exceeds size `k`, we pop the largest element (which helps in keeping only the k smallest fractions).

4. **Extracting the Result**:
   - Finally, the smallest fraction in the max-heap corresponds to our k-th smallest fraction, and we return it as a list.

### Conclusion

This approach provides a systematic way to find the k-th smallest fraction in O(k * log k) complexity, as we only keep and manipulate the k smallest fractions in our heap at any given time. The solution efficiently leverages the properties of sorted arrays and heaps to minimize unnecessary computations.

# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

### Problem Description 
There are `n` cities connected by `m` flights. Each flight starts from city `u` and arrives at `v` with a price `w`.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city `src` and the destination `dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with up to `k` stops. If there is no such route, output `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
The cheapest price from city `0` to city `2` with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.


Example 2:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
The cheapest price from city `0` to city `2` with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.


Constraints:
The number of nodes `n` will be in range `[1, 100]`, with nodes labeled from `0` to `n`` - 1`.

The size of `flights` will be in range `[0, n * (n - 1) / 2]`.

The format of each flight will be `(src, ``dst``, price)`.

The price of each flight will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.

`k` is in the range of `[0, n - 1]`.

There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the cheapest price for a flight from city `src` to city `dst` with up to `k` stops, we can employ a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is typically used to find the shortest paths in a graph with weighted edges. Since the problem permits up to `k` stops, we can iterate through the possible stops to ensure we capture all potential prices.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - We use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each flight from city `u` to city `v` with price `w` can be stored as a list of tuples.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We maintain a list `dist` which keeps track of the minimum price required to reach each city. Initially, we set the price to reach all cities as infinity except for the starting city `src`, which is initialized to 0.

3. **Relaxation**:
   - We will perform relaxation `k + 1` times (including the starting point). In each iteration, we go through each flight and try to update the minimum price to reach city `v` from city `u`.

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - After `k + 1` relaxations, the minimum price to get to city `dst` will be stored in `dist[dst]`. If it remains as infinity, it means there is no reachable path within the allowed stops, and we should return -1.

Let's implement this logic in Python, adhering to the LeetCode solution format.

### Python Code



```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Create a graph as an adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for u, v, w in flights:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Distance table, initialized to "infinity"
        dist = [sys.maxsize] * n
        dist[src] = 0
        
        # Relaxing the edges k + 1 times (including the starting point)
        for _ in range(k + 1):
            # Create a temporary copy of distances for this iteration
            temp_dist = dist[:]
            for u in range(n):
                if dist[u] != sys.maxsize:  # Only consider reachable nodes
                    for v, price in graph[u]:
                        temp_dist[v] = min(temp_dist[v], dist[u] + price)
            dist = temp_dist
        
        # If the distance to the destination is still "infinity", return -1
        return dist[dst] if dist[dst] != sys.maxsize else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - We use `defaultdict` to store the adjacency list representation of the flights.
   
2. **Distance Initialization**: 
   - We initialize a list `dist` and set the distance to the source to `0`.
   
3. **Relaxation**: 
   - We perform a loop for `k + 1` iterations. In each iteration, we create a temporary distance array `temp_dist` to hold the updated distances for this round.
   - For each city `u`, if it’s reachable (i.e., distance is not infinity), we explore its flights to `v`.
   - We update the distance to `v` to be the minimum of its current value and the new calculated price through `u`.

4. **Final Output**: 
   - After processing all iterations, we check the distance to the destination city `dst`. If it's still `infinity`, we return `-1`, indicating that it's unreachable within `k` stops.

This solution is efficient given the constraints, and handles the typical cases for flight pricing with stops effectively.

# 818. Race Car

### Problem Description 
Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go into negative positions.)
Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).

When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: `position += speed, speed *= 2`.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then `speed = -1` , otherwise `speed = 1`.  (Your position stays the same.)
For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.

Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.


Example 1:
Input: 
target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".

Your position goes from 0->1->3.


Example 2:
Input: 
target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".

Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.

Note: 
`1 <= target <= 10000`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of navigating your car to a target position using the least number of instructions (`A` for accelerate and `R` for reverse), we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. This involves exploring all possible states of the car as we execute the instructions and keeping track of the position and speed to determine the minimal sequence to reach the target.

Here's how we can break down the problem:

### Key Points:
1. **Initial State**: The car starts at position 0 with a speed of +1.
2. **Instruction Effects**:
   - `A` (Accelerate): Update position and double the speed.
   - `R` (Reverse): Change the direction of the speed.
3. **Goal**: Reach the target position in the minimum number of instructions.

### BFS Approach:
- Use a queue to explore each possible state of the car: (position, speed, steps).
- Maintain a set to track visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.
- At each step, either accelerate (`A`) or reverse (`R`), and push the resulting state onto the queue if it has not been visited.
- Stop when reaching the target position, and output the number of steps taken.

### Implementation:
Below is the Python code encapsulated in a function that can be run directly on LeetCode.



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestInstructionsToTarget(self, target: int) -> int:
        # Use a deque for BFS
        queue = deque()
        # Set to keep track of visited states
        visited = set()
        # Start with the initial state (position 0, speed 1, and 0 steps)
        queue.append((0, 1, 0))  # (position, speed, steps)
        visited.add((0, 1))
        
        while queue:
            position, speed, steps = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if we reached the target
            if position == target:
                return steps
            
            # Possible states to explore
            # Accelerate
            new_position_a = position + speed
            new_speed_a = speed * 2
            
            if (new_position_a, new_speed_a) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_position_a, new_speed_a))
                queue.append((new_position_a, new_speed_a, steps + 1))
            
            # Reverse
            new_speed_r = -1 if speed > 0 else 1

            if (position, new_speed_r) not in visited:
                visited.add((position, new_speed_r))
                queue.append((position, new_speed_r, steps + 1))

        return -1  # In case no solution found (should not happen as target is reachable)

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We import deque from collections for our BFS implementation.
2. We initialize a queue with the starting position and speed, and a variable to count steps.
3. Inside the while loop, we dequeue the front element and check if it matches the target position.
4. We explore both possible actions (`A` and `R`). For `A`, we calculate the new position and speed, then enqueue it if it hasn't been visited. For `R`, we only change the speed.
5. If we reach the target position, we immediately return the number of steps taken.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of unique states we explore, which in the context of this problem is manageable given the constraints \(1 \leq target \leq 10000\).
- Space complexity also remains within similar bounds due to the storage of each unique state in a set and queue.

This BFS approach ensures we find the minimum number of instructions efficiently.

# 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

### Problem Description 
There are `N` workers.  The `i`-th worker has a `quality[i]` and a minimum wage expectation `wage[i]`.

Now we want to hire exactly `K` workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.

Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.

Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.


Example 1:
Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.


Example 2:
Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 
Note:
`1 <= K <= N <= 10000`, where `N = quality.length = wage.length`
`1 <= quality[i] <= 10000`
`1 <= wage[i] <= 10000`
Answers within `10^-5` of the correct answer will be considered correct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of hiring K workers with the minimum total payment while respecting their quality-to-wage ratio, we can follow a clear strategy. The overall idea is to consider the ratio of wage to quality for each worker, and utilize a min-heap to efficiently manage the selection of K workers with the lowest total cost.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Calculate the Ratio**: For each worker, compute the wage-to-quality ratio. This ratio helps to identify the minimum wage we need to pay the workers based on their quality.

2. **Sort Workers by Ratio**: We will sort the workers based on this ratio in ascending order. If we find a suitable ratio, we will then select workers with the lowest total quality.

3. **Use a Min-Heap**: We will maintain a min-heap to keep track of the workers we have selected so far. The total quality of those workers will help us in calculating the total wage payment.

4. **Calculate Minimum Payment**: For each worker, after sorting by ratio, we will check if we can include them in the group of K workers (using the heap to manage their qualities). Whenever we reach a group size of K, we calculate the total cost based on the current ratio.

5. **Return the Minimum Cost**: We will keep track of the minimum cost found during this process, considering all valid K groups.

Here’s the implementation in Python, formatted to run directly on the LeetCode platform:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def mincostToHireWorkers(self, quality: List[int], wage: List[int], K: int) -> float:
        workers = []
        
        # Create tuples of (wage/quality_ratio, quality, wage) for all workers
        for q, w in zip(quality, wage):
            workers.append((w / q, q, w))
        
        # Sort workers by their wage-to-quality ratio
        workers.sort()
        
        min_cost = float('inf')
        total_quality = 0
        heap = []

        # Iterate through each worker in the sorted list
        for ratio, q, w in workers:
            # Add current worker's quality to the min-heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, -q)  # use negative to simulate max-heap
            total_quality += q
            
            # If we have more than K workers, remove the one with the maximum quality
            if len(heap) > K:
                total_quality += heapq.heappop(heap)  # remove max quality (most negative)
            
            # If we have exactly K workers, calculate the cost
            if len(heap) == K:
                # Calculate the total cost at the current ratio
                cost = total_quality * ratio
                min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)

        return min_cost

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: We start by pairing each worker's quality and wage into a list called `workers`, where each entry is a tuple containing the wage-to-quality ratio, the quality, and the wage.

2. **Sorting**: We sort the `workers` list based on the ratio, ensuring that we analyze workers starting with the cheapest cost per quality.

3. **Using a Min-Heap**: We utilize a min-heap (implemented as a max-heap using negative values) to efficiently maintain and retrieve the highest quality worker when necessary.

4. **Looping Through Workers**: As we loop through each worker, we add their quality to our total and check if we can form a group of exactly K workers. If we exceed K workers, the highest quality worker is removed.

5. **Cost Calculation**: Whenever we have exactly K workers, we compute the potential cost and check if it's the cheapest one found so far.

6. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the minimum cost found during the iterations.

This solution is efficient, handling the maximum constraints effectively while providing the correct result within the desired precision.

# 864. Shortest Path to Get All Keys

### Problem Description 
We are given a 2-dimensional `grid`. `"."` is an empty cell, `"#"` is a wall, `"@"` is the starting point, (`"a"`, `"b"`, ...) are keys, and (`"A"`, `"B"`, ...) are locks.

We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions.  We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.  If we walk over a key, we pick it up.  We can't walk over a lock unless we have the corresponding key.

For some 1 <= K <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first `K` letters of the English alphabet in the grid.  This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.

Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys.  If it's impossible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: ["@.a.#","###.#","b.A.B"]
Output: 8

Example 2:
Input: ["@..aA","..B#.","....b"]
Output: 6
Note:
`1 <= grid.length <= 30`
`1 <= grid[0].length <= 30`
`grid[i][j]` contains only` '.'`, `'#'`, `'@'`, `'a'-``'f``'` and `'A'-'F'`
The number of keys is in `[1, 6]`.  Each key has a different letter and opens exactly one lock.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of collecting all keys in a grid while adhering to the movement constraints and lock-key relationships, we will utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This method allows us to explore the grid efficiently while keeping track of the states (i.e., current position and collected keys).

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Representation**: The grid is a 2D list where:
   - `"."` represents an empty cell.
   - `"#"` represents a wall.
   - `"@"` represents the starting point.
   - Lowercase letters (`"a"` to `"f"`) represent keys.
   - Uppercase letters (`"A"` to `"F"`) represent locks.

2. **Keys and Locks**: For every key found, there is a corresponding lock that must be opened to pass through.

3. **State Tracking**: We will keep track of the current position in the grid and the keys collected so far using a bitmask.

4. **BFS Algorithm**: We will explore all possible moves and update our position and key state until we either collect all keys or exhaust our options.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Locate the Starting Point**: Identify the position of the starting point (`"@"`) and store positions for all keys and locks.

2. **Use BFS**: Initialize a queue for BFS that stores tuples of (current position, keys collected, number of moves).

3. **Search Through the Grid**:
   - Move in four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Check if the new position is within bounds and not a wall.
   - If we encounter a key, collect it (update the key state).
   - If we encounter a lock, check if the corresponding key has been collected.

4. **Completion Check**: If all keys are collected, return the number of moves taken.

5. **End Conditions**: If we exhaust our searches without collecting all keys, return `-1`.

### Python Code:
The following code implements the aforementioned logic:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestPathAllKeys(self, grid: list[str]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        total_keys = 0
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        
        # Locate the starting point and count total keys
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '@':
                    start_x, start_y = r, c
                elif 'a' <= grid[r][c] <= 'f':
                    total_keys += 1
        
        # Directions for moving in 4 cardinal directions
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        queue = deque([(start_x, start_y, 0, 0)])  # (x, y, keys collected, steps)
        visited = set([(start_x, start_y, 0)])  # (x, y, keys)
        
        while queue:
            x, y, keys, steps = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if we have collected all keys
            if keys == (1 << total_keys) - 1:
                return steps  # Return the number of steps to collect all keys
            
            # Explore neighbors
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                
                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols:  # Stay within bounds
                    cell = grid[nx][ny]
                    
                    if cell == '#':
                        continue  # Wall, cannot pass
                    
                    if 'A' <= cell <= 'F':  # It's a lock
                        lock_index = ord(cell) - ord('A')
                        if not (keys & (1 << lock_index)):
                            continue  # Need the key to pass through

                    if 'a' <= cell <= 'f':  # It's a key
                        key_index = ord(cell) - ord('a')
                        new_keys = keys | (1 << key_index)  # Collect the key
                    
                    else:
                        new_keys = keys  # No new key collected
                    
                    state = (nx, ny, new_keys)
                    if state not in visited:
                        visited.add(state)
                        queue.append((nx, ny, new_keys, steps + 1))
        
        return -1  # If we exhaust BFS without collecting all keys

```

### Explanation:
- We first parse the grid to find the starting point and count the keys.
- We then use BFS to explore all directions from the current position.
- At each step, we check if we can move to a new position based on whether it's a wall, a key, or a lock.
- If all keys are collected, we return the number of moves. If we finish exploring without collecting all keys, we return `-1`. 

This solution efficiently searches the grid and adheres to constraints, ensuring each state is only processed once.

# 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops

### Problem Description 
A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each `station[i]` represents a gas station that is `station[i][0]` miles east of the starting position, and has `station[i][1]` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.


Example 1:
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.


Example 2:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).


Example 3:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We start with 10 liters of fuel.

We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.

Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.

We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

Note:
`1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9`
`0 <= stations.length <= 500`
`0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] < target`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the least number of refueling stops needed for a car to reach its destination given an array of gas stations, we can leverage a greedy approach combined with a priority queue (max-heap) to prioritize refueling at the most beneficial gas stations.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - We are given the `target` distance, the `startFuel`, and a list of `stations` where each station indicates its position and how much fuel it provides.
   - We need to keep track of the current position (starting at 0), the fuel left, and the number of refueling stops made.

2. **Iterating Through Stations**:
   - We iterate through the array of stations and check if we can reach each station with the current fuel.
   - If we can reach a station, we consider how much fuel we could get if we stopped there. 
   - If we cannot reach the next station, we need to refuel first at previously passed stations (if available).

3. **Using a Max-Heap**:
   - When at a gas station, we push the amount of fuel we could gain from that station into a max-heap.
   - If we run out of fuel and we have no reachable stations left to refuel from, we cannot continue and return `-1`.
   - Each time we refuel, we increment the refueling stops counter.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After trying to reach all stations, we must check if we can reach the `target`. If we can, we return the number of refueling stops, otherwise, `-1`.

### Implementation

Here's how we can implement this step by step in Python:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Add target as a station with 0 fuel
        stations.append([target, 0])
        
        # Initialize a heap for maximum fuel management
        max_heap = []
        
        # Current position, current fuel, and stops counter
        current_pos = 0
        current_fuel = startFuel
        stops = 0
        
        for pos, fuel in stations:
            # Drive to the next station
            current_fuel -= (pos - current_pos)
            
            # While we can't reach the current station and there's fuel in the heap
            while current_fuel < 0 and max_heap:
                # Refuel from the largest available fuel station we passed
                current_fuel += -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # use negative for max heap
                stops += 1
            
            # If we still cannot reach the current station, return -1
            if current_fuel < 0:
                return -1
            
            # We've reached the current station
            current_pos = pos
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -fuel)  # Push negative fuel for max heap
            
        return stops

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Heap Usage**: Using a max-heap helps efficiently manage and retrieve the best fueling options (the maximum fuel from previous stations) allowing us to refuel only when necessary.

2. **Iterate Through Stations**: As we iterate through the stations, we subtract the distance from the current fuel and check when we can no longer proceed.

3. **Greedily Refueling**: Whenever we hit a point where we can't go further, we pop from the max-heap to refuel until we can reach the current station or run out of options.

4. **Final Output**: If we can proceed to the last station (`target`), we return the count of refuels; otherwise, if we are unable to continue, we return `-1`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of stations (due to sorting and heap operations).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the heap storing up to n fuel stocks. 

This ensures a robust, efficient solution for the problem within given constraints.

# 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph

### Problem Description 
You are given an undirected graph (the "original graph") with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You decide to subdivide each edge in the graph into a chain of nodes, with the number of new nodes varying between each edge.

The graph is given as a 2D array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, cnti]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the original graph, and `cnti` is the total number of new nodes that you will subdivide the edge into. Note that `cnti == 0` means you will not subdivide the edge.

To subdivide the edge `[ui, vi]`, replace it with `(cnti + 1)` new edges and `cnti` new nodes. The new nodes are `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xcnti`, and the new edges are `[ui, x1]`, `[x1, x2]`, `[x2, x3]`, ..., `[xcnti+1, xcnti]`, `[xcnti, vi]`.

In this new graph, you want to know how many nodes are reachable from the node `0`, where a node is reachable if the distance is `maxMoves` or less.

Given the original graph and `maxMoves`, return the number of nodes that are reachable from node `0` in the new graph.


Example 1:
Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], maxMoves = 6, n = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: The edge subdivisions are shown in the image above.

The nodes that are reachable are highlighted in yellow.


Example 2:
Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], maxMoves = 10, n = 4
Output: 23

Example 3:
Input: edges = [[1,2,4],[1,4,5],[1,3,1],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]], maxMoves = 17, n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Node 0 is disconnected from the rest of the graph, so only node 0 is reachable.


Constraints:
`0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 104)`
`edges[i].length == 3`
`0 <= ui < vi < n`
There are no multiple edges in the graph.

`0 <= cnti <= 104`
`0 <= maxMoves <= 109`
`1 <= n <= 3000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting how many nodes are reachable from node `0` in a subdivided undirected graph, we can follow the steps below:

1. **Graph Representation**: Since the graph can have edges that are subdivided into several smaller parts with intermediate nodes, we can represent the new graph using an adjacency list.

2. **Traversal**: We will employ a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the graph starting from node `0`. We will keep track of the accumulated "cost" in moves as we traverse along the edges, ensuring that we do not exceed `maxMoves`.

3. **Counting Reachable Nodes**: Each time we reach a new node through valid moves, we will count it as reachable.

Here’s the implementation in Python that follows the LeetCode solution format:



```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def reachableNodes(self, edges: list[list[int]], maxMoves: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Construct the graph with subdivisions
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Adding edges to the graph considering subdivisions
        for u, v, cnt in edges:
            # Each edge [u, v] with count of intermediate nodes `cnt`
            # We have `cnt + 1` segments (u to x1, x1 to x2, ..., x(cnt) to v)
            graph[u].append((v, cnt + 1))  # From u to v there's `cnt + 1` nodes
            graph[v].append((u, cnt + 1))  # Also from v to u
        
        # BFS to count reachable nodes
        queue = deque([(0, 0)])  # (current_node, accumulated_moves)
        visited = set()
        visited.add(0)
        reachable_count = 0
        
        while queue:
            current_node, current_moves = queue.popleft()
            reachable_count += 1  # Count the current node as reachable
            
            for neighbor, total_steps in graph[current_node]:
                # How many additional moves are needed to reach this neighbor
                needed_moves = total_steps
                
                if current_moves + needed_moves <= maxMoves and neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, current_moves + needed_moves))
                    
                # Count the new nodes that are reachable from the edge
                if current_moves + needed_moves <= maxMoves:
                    # This condition means we can reach those new nodes
                    # We can only use the moves we have available
                    # The maximum new nodes we can visit on this edge
                    reachable_from_edge = maxMoves - current_moves - needed_moves
                    reachable_nodes_from_edge = min(reachable_from_edge, total_steps)  # Cannot exceed the total subdivisions
                    
                    if reachable_nodes_from_edge > 0:
                        # Counting already visited nodes
                        # If there are reachable intermediate nodes not counted yet
                        for x in range(1, reachable_nodes_from_edge + 1):
                            if (current_node, neighbor, x) not in visited:
                                reachable_count += 1
            
            # It's important to mark `neighbor` as visited here only after checking for all conditions above
            
        return reachable_count

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We use a `defaultdict` for our adjacency list to store edges and the number of intermediate nodes for each connection.

2. **BFS Setup**:
   - Initialize a queue for BFS starting from node `0` with `0` accumulated moves.
   - A set is used to track visited nodes.

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - For each node dequeued, we add to our reachable count.
   - We check each neighbor to see if it can be reached without exceeding `maxMoves`.
   - The number of intermediate nodes reachable is computed based on remaining moves.

4. **Counting**:
   - Whenever we determine that we can follow an edge and traverse through its intermediates, we count those nodes correctly while avoiding double counting.

### Complexity
- The approach should run efficiently within the limits, as the BFS handles nodes in a straightforward manner and we use direct adjacency checks without nested loops, primarily bounded by the number of edges.

You can directly paste this code in the LeetCode editor and run it to test against various cases.

# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

### Problem Description 
Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).


Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).

The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).

Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.

We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].


Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= points.length <= 104`
`-104 < xi, yi < 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)` in a 2D plane, we can utilize a few approaches. A straightforward method employs calculating the squared distance from the origin for each point and then sorting them based on this distance. However, this could be inefficient when `k` is much smaller than the number of points, as sorting the entire list would take `O(n log n)` time. 

Instead, we can use a max-heap to maintain only the `k` closest points. This approach allows us to find the `k` closest points in `O(n log k)` time complexity, which is more efficient for large inputs.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Calculate the squared distance**: For each point `(xi, yi)`, calculate the squared distance from the origin as `distance = xi^2 + yi^2`. We can skip taking the square root since we only need to compare distances.

2. **Maintain a max-heap**: Use a max-heap of size `k` to store the closest points. The max-heap will store tuples of the squared distance and the point itself.

3. **Push to the heap**: For each point, we push it onto the heap. If the size of the heap exceeds `k`, we pop the point with the maximum distance (furthest point).

4. **Extract the closest points**: Once we process all points, the heap will contain the `k` closest points. We can return these points.

Here's the implementation in Python:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Max-heap to store the closest points
        max_heap = []
        
        for x, y in points:
            # Calculate squared distance from the origin
            distance = x*x + y*y
            
            # Push the negative of the distance because heapq is a min-heap by default
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-distance, [x, y]))
            
            # If we have more than k points, pop the farthest point
            if len(max_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        
        # Extract points from the heap and return them
        return [point for _, point in max_heap]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Heap Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty max-heap (`max_heap`).
  
2. **Iterate through Points**: For each point `(x, y)` in the input `points`:
    - Compute its squared distance from the origin.
    - Push the point (along with its negative distance) onto the max-heap.
  
3. **Maintain Size of Heap**: If the heap size exceeds `k`, we remove the point with the maximum squared distance. This keeps the heap to contain only the `k` closest points.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we construct our result by extracting the points from the max-heap and returning them.

### Time Complexity:
- The overall time complexity is `O(n log k)`, where `n` is the number of points and `k` is the number of closest points we need to find. The space complexity is `O(k)` due to the storage in the heap.

This method ensures efficient retrieval of the `k` closest points while avoiding unnecessary sorting of all points.

# 1046. Last Stone Weight

### Problem Description 
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:
If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

Example 1:
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.

Note:
`1 <= stones.length <= 30`
`1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the weight of the last remaining stone, we can simulate the process of smashing the stones using a max heap data structure. This way, we can efficiently access the two heaviest stones at each step.

### Approach:

1. **Use a Max Heap**: Since we need to repeatedly find the two heaviest stones, a max heap (or priority queue) is a perfect fit. In Python, we can use the `heapq` library which by default provides a min heap, so we will push the negative values of our stones into the heap to simulate a max heap.
   
2. **Smash the Stones**: 
   - At each iteration, we extract the two heaviest stones (the two smallest negative values in our heap).
   - If the stones are of equal weight, they are both destroyed.
   - If they are not equal, we compute the weight of the remaining stone (subtract the smaller from the larger) and push this new weight back into the heap.
   
3. **Stop When Done**: We continue this process until we have zero or one stone left in the heap.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, if no stones are left, we return `0`; otherwise, we return the weight of the last remaining stone.

### Detailed Explanation with Code:

Here’s the Python code that implements the above approach:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones):
        # Create a max heap using negative values
        max_heap = [-stone for stone in stones]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        # While there are at least two stones
        while len(max_heap) > 1:
            # Pop the two heaviest stones
            first = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            second = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            
            # If they are not the same, push the difference back into the heap
            if first != second:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, -(first - second))
        
        # If no stones are left, return 0, otherwise return the weight of the last stone
        return -max_heap[0] if max_heap else 0

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `lastStoneWeight` which takes a list of stones as input.
- We convert the stones into a max heap by storing their negative values.
- The main while loop continues until only one or no stones are left in the heap.
- We pop the two heaviest stones, compare their weights, and if they are not equal, the difference of their weights is pushed back into the heap.
- Finally, if the heap is empty, we return `0`, otherwise we return the weight of the last stone which is the negation of the value at the root of the heap.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: Each insertion and deletion operation in the heap takes \(O(\log n)\). Since we process \(n\) pairs of stones at most, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The additional space used for the heap is \(O(n)\).

This code follows the LeetCode submission format and can be directly tested on the LeetCode platform.

# 1054. Distant Barcodes

### Problem Description 
In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the `ith` barcode is `barcodes[i]`.

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.


Example 1:
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,1,2,1,2]

Constraints:
`1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000`
`1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rearranging barcodes in such a way that no two adjacent barcodes are the same, we can follow a systematic approach:

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   We need to rearrange the barcodes such that no two adjacent elements are the same. The input will consist of a list of integer barcodes, and we will return a new arrangement of them fulfilling the aforementioned condition.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: 
   First, we will count the frequency of each barcode using a dictionary or a `Counter` from the `collections` module. This will help us know how many times each barcode appears.

3. **Max-Heap for Arrangement**:
   We can use a max-heap (or priority queue) to keep track of the barcodes starting from the one that appears the most. This helps prioritize placing the most frequent barcode where it can fit without causing adjacent duplicates.

4. **Rearranging Barcodes**:
   We will pop the most frequent barcode from the heap and place it in the result list. After placing, we should store it temporarily (with reduced frequency) and ensure that we do not place it again consecutively. After placing one barcode, we can attempt to place the next most frequent barcode.

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   We will continue this process until we have rearranged all barcodes. Given the problem guarantees that there is always a valid arrangement, we won't need to handle errors for unreachable arrangements.

### Python Code:

Here's a Python implementation following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def rearrangeBarcodes(self, barcodes):
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each barcode
        count = Counter(barcodes)
        
        # Step 2: Create a max heap based on the barcode frequencies
        max_heap = []
        for barcode, freq in count.items():
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-freq, barcode))  # push negative frequency for max-heap behavior
        
        # Step 3: Prepare to build the result
        result = []
        prev_freq, prev_barcode = 0, None
        
        # Step 4: Arrange the barcodes
        while max_heap:
            # Step 4a: Get the most frequent barcode
            freq, barcode = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result.append(barcode)  # append the barcode to result
            
            # Step 4b: If we had a previously stored barcode, push it back to the heap
            if prev_freq < 0:  # if there's a barcode that we need to put back
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (prev_freq, prev_barcode))
            
            # Step 4c: Update the frequency and store for next iteration
            prev_freq = freq + 1  # decrease the frequency
            prev_barcode = barcode  # store the current barcode
        
        return result

```

### Detailed Steps Breakdown:
1. **Count Frequencies**: We count how many times each barcode appears using `Counter`.
2. **Max Heap Initialization**: We initialize a max heap (using negative values since Python’s `heapq` is a min-heap by default).
3. **Constructing the result**:
   - We keep popping from the heap to get the most abundant barcode to place into the result.
   - We ensure to manage the frequency correctly and avoid placing the same barcode consecutively by using a previously stored (and updated) barcode variable.
4. **Output**: Finally, we return the rearranged list.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this solution is O(n log k), where n is the number of barcodes, and k is the number of unique barcodes, primarily due to heap operations.

This approach guarantees that no two adjacent barcodes will be the same while efficiently building a valid output.

# 1439. Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows

### Problem Description 
You are given an `m * n` matrix, `mat`, and an integer `k`, which has its rows sorted in non-decreasing order.

You are allowed to choose exactly 1 element from each row to form an array. Return the Kth smallest array sum among all possible arrays.


Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are:
[1,2], [1,4], [3,2], [3,4], [1,6]. Where the 5th sum is 7.  

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 9
Output: 17

Example 3:
Input: mat = [[1,10,10],[1,4,5],[2,3,6]], k = 7
Output: 9
Explanation: Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are:
[1,1,2], [1,1,3], [1,4,2], [1,4,3], [1,1,6], [1,5,2], [1,5,3]. Where the 7th sum is 9.  

Example 4:
Input: mat = [[1,1,10],[2,2,9]], k = 7
Output: 12

Constraints:
`m == mat.length`
`n == mat.length[i]`
`1 <= m, n <= 40`
`1 <= k <= min(200, n ^ m)`
`1 <= mat[i][j] <= 5000`
`mat[i]` is a non decreasing array.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the Kth smallest array sum from a given `m * n` matrix `mat`, where each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can utilize a min-heap. The approach works by starting with the smallest sums based on the first row and iteratively generating larger sums by adding one element from each row.

Here's how the method generally proceeds:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial min-heap that holds tuples in the form `(current_sum, row_indices)` where `current_sum` is the sum of elements chosen so far, and `row_indices` is a tuple representing the chosen elements' indices for each row. 

2. **Heap Operations**: 
    - Push the sum of the first elements from all rows into the heap. This is our starting point.
    - Pop the smallest element from the heap each time to find the next smallest sum. 
    - For the popped element, generate new sums by replacing each row's chosen element with the next possible element from that row (if available) and push these new sums back into the heap.

3. **K Iterations**: We perform this process K times. After K pops from the heap, the smallest element popped will be the Kth smallest sum.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python, ready to be copied into the LeetCode environment:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        m = len(mat)
        n = len(mat[0])
        
        # The heap will store tuples of (current_sum, row_indices)
        min_heap = []
        
        # Start with the first row's minimum element
        initial_sum = sum(row[0] for row in mat)
        initial_indices = tuple(0 for _ in range(m))
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (initial_sum, initial_indices))
        
        # A set to track visited combinations of row indices
        visited = {initial_indices}
        
        # We will pop from the heap K times
        for _ in range(k):
            current_sum, indices = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # If we popped for the k-th time, it's our answer
            if _ == k - 1:
                return current_sum
            
            # Generate next possible states by incrementing indices
            for row in range(m):
                if indices[row] + 1 < n:  # Ensure we're not going out of bounds
                    # Create new indices by increasing the current row index
                    new_indices = list(indices)
                    new_indices[row] += 1
                    new_indices = tuple(new_indices)  # Make it a tuple for hashing
                
                    if new_indices not in visited:
                        visited.add(new_indices)
                        new_sum = current_sum - mat[row][indices[row]] + mat[row][new_indices[row]]
                        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_sum, new_indices))
        
        return -1  # Just in case, shouldn't happen with valid inputs

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Imports and Class Definition**: We import `heapq` for the heap operations and define our solution class `Solution` with a method `kthSmallest`.

2. **Heap Initialization**: The initial sum is calculated from the first element of each row, and we push that into the min-heap along with the tuple of indices (which are all 0 initially).

3. **Main Loop**: We repeat the popping process K times. For each popped element, we calculate which new sums can be generated by trying to increase the index of each row's selected element.

4. **Tuple and Set for Tracking**: We use tuples to easily manage row indices and introduce a set `visited` to prevent pushing the same combination of indices into the heap multiple times.

5. **Return the Result**: The Kth smallest sum is returned once we pop from the heap K times.

This approach is efficient given the constraints and leverages the sorted property of the input matrix.

# 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (0-indexed),
If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.

If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or `(h[i+1] - h[i])` bricks.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.


Example 1:
Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.

- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.

- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.

- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.

It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.


Example 2:
Input: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
Output: 7

Example 3:
Input: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0
Output: 3

Constraints:
`1 <= heights.length <= 105`
`1 <= heights[i] <= 106`
`0 <= bricks <= 109`
`0 <= ladders <= heights.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the furthest building index that can be reached using a given number of bricks and ladders, we need to simulate the journey through the buildings while making optimal use of the resources available (bricks and ladders). Here's how we can approach this problem:

### Approach

1. **Data Tracking**: 
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the height differences when moving to a taller building. This will help in efficiently choosing when to use ladders instead of bricks.
  
2. **Iterate Through Buildings**:
   - For each building, compare its height with the next building's height.
   - If the next building is shorter or of the same height, move without using any resources.
   - If the next building is taller, calculate the height difference and decide whether to use a ladder or bricks:
     - Always try to use a ladder for the largest height differences to preserve bricks for smaller differences.
  
3. **Resource Management**:
   - When encountering a height difference, push it onto the min-heap.
   - If at any point the size of the min-heap exceeds the number of ladders, that means we need to use bricks for the smallest height difference recorded. This is done by popping the smallest item from the heap and subtracting its value from the bricks available.
   - If the number of bricks ever drops below zero, we cannot proceed further; hence, we return the index of the last reachable building.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where we might not need any resources or can use all ladders without ever running out of bricks.

### Implementation

The following is the Python implementation encapsulated in a class as per LeetCode format:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:
        # Min-heap to store the height differences
        min_heap = []
        
        # Iterate through each building
        for i in range(len(heights) - 1):
            # Calculate the height difference
            diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i]
            if diff > 0:
                # If the next building is taller
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, diff)
            
            # If we have more climbs than ladders, we need to use bricks for the largest diff.
            if len(min_heap) > ladders:
                # Use bricks for the smallest height difference (because it was the min-heap)
                bricks_needed = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                bricks -= bricks_needed
            
            # If bricks become negative, we cannot proceed further
            if bricks < 0:
                return i
        
        # If we did not run out of resources, return the last building index
        return len(heights) - 1

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We import `heapq` to make use of the min-heap functionality.
- The `furthestBuilding` method takes three arguments: the list of building heights, the number of bricks, and the number of ladders.
- We iterate through `heights` until the second last building (using `range(len(heights) - 1)`) because we compare each building to the next one.
- For each building, if the next one is taller, we calculate the difference and add it to our heap.
- After potentially adding to the heap, if the number of height differences stored exceeds the number of available ladders, we use the smallest difference to decrease our brick count.
- If at any point our brick count goes negative, we return the current index `i` as it indicates we cannot proceed further.
- If we manage to loop through all buildings without running out of resources, we return the last building index, which is `len(heights) - 1`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the use of a heap, making it efficient given the constraints of the problem.

# 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more competitive than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number less than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[1,3,4]` is more competitive than `[1,3,5]` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and `4` is less than `5`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
Output: [2,3,3,4]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
`1 <= k <= nums.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the most competitive subsequence of size `k` from the integer array `nums`, we need an efficient algorithm that can produce the result under the provided constraints.

A subsequence is defined as a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements can be removed without changing the order of the remaining elements. Our task is to generate a subsequence of length `k` such that it is lexicographically smallest.

### Approach

1. **Use a Stack**: We can utilize a stack data structure to build our results. As we traverse `nums`, we'll decide whether to include each number in our subsequence.
  
2. **Condition to Pop from Stack**: When deciding whether to include a number, we can pop from the stack (remove elements) if:
   - The stack is not empty.
   - The current number is smaller than the top of the stack.
   - We still have enough elements left in `nums` to fill the subsequence of size `k`.

   This is because, to maintain the most competitive subsequence, we might want to discard larger elements at the end of our required sequence if smaller elements are available.

3. **Building the Final Subsequence**: Once we've processed all elements, the first `k` elements of our stack will represent the most competitive subsequence.

### Pseudocode Breakdown

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums`.
3. For each number:
   - While the stack has elements and the top of the stack is greater than the current number:
     - Check if popping the top of the stack would allow us to still be able to fill the subsequence to size `k`. If so, pop the stack.
   - Append the current number to the stack.
4. Once done iterating through `nums`, the first `k` elements of the stack are our answer.

### Implementation

Let's implement this logic in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def mostCompetitive(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        n = len(nums)
        
        for i in range(n):
            # While stack is not empty and conditions are met, pop the last element
            while (stack and 
                   stack[-1] > nums[i] and 
                   len(stack) - 1 + (n - i) >= k):
                stack.pop()
            # Add the current number to the stack if we haven't filled k elements yet
            if len(stack) < k:
                stack.append(nums[i])
        
        return stack[:k]  # Return only the first k elements of the stack

```

### Explanation of Code

- **Class Definition**: This code follows the LeetCode format with a `Solution` class containing a method `mostCompetitive`.
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `nums`: the list of integers.
  - `k`: the required size of the subsequence.

- **Stack Logic**: 
  - We iterate through `nums` and use a stack to manage our resulting subsequence.
  - By popping from the stack, we can discard less competitive numbers while ensuring we can still fill up to `k` items.

- **Final Return**: Lastly, we return the first `k` elements of our stack, which represent the most competitive subsequence. 

This solution efficiently constructs the result in linear time, O(n), and uses a stack to ensure that we have the smallest lexicographical order possible by the conditions we set.

# 1675. Minimize Deviation in Array

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
If the element is even, divide it by `2`.

	
For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2].`
If the element is odd, multiply it by `2`.

	
For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4].`
The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,10,8]
Output: 3

Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`2 <= n <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of minimizing the deviation of an array after performing allowed operations on its elements, we can take advantage of the operations available for odd and even integers. Our main goal is to find the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the transformed array.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Operations**:
   - If an element is even, we can continue dividing it by 2 until it becomes odd.
   - If an element is odd, we can multiply it by 2 any number of times.
   - Thus, we can think of our operations as being able to turn even numbers into their lower odd forms and odd numbers into higher even forms.

2. **Strategy**:
   - Start by converting all even numbers in the array to the maximum odd number they can reach by continually dividing by 2.
   - We aim to track the maximum value among the even numbers and deal with odd numbers as they get multiplied.
   - Use a max-heap (or priority queue) to efficiently get the current maximum value of the array and to reduce the complexity when we switch from an even number downwards.
   - While the current maximum number is even, we continuously halve it. After that, we compute the current deviation and update our minimum deviation if the new deviation is smaller.

3. **Using a Max-Heap for Efficiency**:
   - A max-heap allows us to always access the largest element efficiently.
   - For each iteration, we check the maximum element, reduce it if it's even, and if not, calculate the deviation with the min element we recorded so far.

### Python Code

Here’s the code implemented in accordance with the LeetCode solution format:



```python
from typing import List
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumDeviation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Convert all odd numbers to even by multiplying by 2
        max_heap = []
        for num in nums:
            if num % 2 == 1:
                num *= 2  # make it even
            max_heap.append(-num)  # use negative for max-heap with min-heap functionality
        
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)  # Create the max-heap
        
        # Initialize the minimum value as the smallest original number (after making odds even)
        min_value = -max(max_heap)  # This is our initial minimum (the max of the evens we pushed in)
        min_deviation = float('inf')  # Initially our minimum deviation is Infinity
        
        # Step 2: Continue until we can reduce the maximum
        while True:
            max_value = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Get current max (in negated form)
            min_deviation = min(min_deviation, max_value - min_value)  # Calculate current deviation
            
            # If the maximum value is odd, break out of loop (we can't reduce it further)
            if max_value % 2 == 1:
                break
            
            # Step 3: Divide max_value by 2 and push it back to heap
            new_value = max_value // 2
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_value)  # Push the new max back (negated)
            min_value = min(min_value, new_value)  # Update min_value if necessary
        
        return min_deviation

```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array:
  - Heap operations (push and pop) take O(log n), and since we potentially process each number a limited number of times, we achieve this overall complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing elements in the max heap.

This approach effectively minimizes the deviation by leveraging the operations allowed in an optimal manner, ensuring we always operate on the current maximum efficiently while keeping track of the smallest element.

# 1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples

### Problem Description 
There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for `n` days. On the `ith` day, the tree grows `apples[i]` apples that will rot after `days[i]` days, that is on day `i + days[i]` the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by `apples[i] == 0` and `days[i] == 0`.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first `n` days.

Given two integer arrays `days` and `apples` of length `n`, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.


Example 1:
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.

- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.

- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.

- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.


Example 2:
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.

- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.

- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.


Constraints:
`apples.length == n`
`days.length == n`
`1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
`0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104`
`days[i] = 0` if and only if `apples[i] = 0`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the maximum number of apples you can eat from the special apple tree, we need to account for the apples grown each day and their corresponding rotting times. The approach we'll take involves simulating the process day by day while using a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently manage the apples that we can consume.

### Solution Explanation

1. **Heap Structure**: We will utilize a max-heap to keep track of the apples that can be eaten. Each entry in the heap will be a tuple consisting of the number of apples and the expiration day, allowing us to always choose the apple batch that has the most apples available up until its expiration.

2. **Iterate Through Days**: We will iterate over a range of days (up to `n + max(days)`) since we might continue to eat the apples even after the tree stops producing new ones.

3. **Daily Actions**:
   - On a given day, if we have apples produced on that particular day, we push them into the max-heap along with their corresponding expiration day.
   - At the beginning of each day, we will first check if we can eat an apple:
     - We pop from the heap (to get the batch of apples with the highest count) if available.
     - Check if the apples in the heap have expired (i.e., the current day is greater than their expiration day). If they have, we discard them.

4. **Consume Apples**: We eat one apple from the current batch of available apples, reducing its count and, if still more remain, pushing it back into the heap.

5. **Count the Apples**: Maintain a counter of the total apples eaten throughout the process.

### Implementation

Here's how this can be implemented in Python, in the format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def eatenApples(self, apples: List[int], days: List[int]) -> int:
        max_heap = []
        total_apples_eaten = 0
        n = len(apples)
        
        for today in range(max(n, max(days)) + 1):  # check up to the max possible days
            if today < n and apples[today] > 0:  # Add today's apples if available
                # We push into the heap as (-count, expiration day) to turn it into a max heap
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-apples[today], today + days[today]))

            # Remove expired apples from the top of the heap
            while max_heap and max_heap[0][1] <= today:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)

            # If we have any apples to eat, eat one
            if max_heap:
                count, expiration = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                total_apples_eaten += 1  # Eat one apple
                count = -count - 1  # Reduce the count of remaining apples
                if count > 0:
                    heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-count, expiration))  # Push back if there are any left

        return total_apples_eaten

```

### Key Points:
- **Heap Operations**: The use of a max-heap ensures that each time we want to eat an apple, we can always access the batch with the highest amount available efficiently.
- **Complexity**: The overall time complexity is O(n log n) in the worst-case scenario due to heap operations occurring for each day.
- **Edge Cases**: The code accounts for days on which no apples are grown and handles the scenario where apples may surpass the time limit through efficient management of the heap.

This direct and efficient method ensures that we can maximize the number of apples consumed over the days the tree produces them.

# 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones

### Problem Description 
You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes `a`​​​​​​, `b`,​​​​​​ and `c`​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add `1` point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers `a`​​​​​, `b`,​​​​​ and `c`​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.


Example 1:
Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.


Example 2:
Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.


Example 3:
Input: a = 1, b = 8, c = 8
Output: 8
Explanation: One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.

After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.


Constraints:
`1 <= a, b, c <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the score in the solitaire game with three piles of stones, we can utilize a straightforward but effective strategy. The idea is to keep pairing stones from the two largest piles until we can no longer do so.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Pairing**: When we can choose stones from two different non-empty piles, we should always try to take from the two largest piles available. This is because we can extract the maximum score this way, as it allows us to maintain more piles that can continue to contribute to our score.

2. **Using the Max Method**: To find the solution, we can sort the three piles (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and identify the two largest piles to repeatedly take stones from. By continuing this process, we ensure that we are always optimizing the score.

3. **Conditions of the Game Ending**: The game ends when there are fewer than two non-empty piles. Thus, our task is to count how many stones we can take (pairing from the largest until we run out).

4. **Implementation Strategy**: We can follow this algorithm:
   - Sort the three piles.
   - Continuously decrement the top two piles and keep count of the points scored.
   - Stop when one of the piles becomes empty, i.e., when less than two piles are non-empty.

### Python Code:

Now we will implement this logic in Python as per the LeetCode format.



```python
class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        # Create a list of the piles and sort it
        piles = [a, b, c]
        piles.sort()
        
        # While there are at least two non-empty piles
        score = 0
        while piles[1] > 0 and piles[2] > 0:  # second pile and third pile are the two largest
            # Take one stone from both of the largest piles
            piles[1] -= 1  # remove stone from the second largest
            piles[2] -= 1  # remove stone from the largest
            score += 1  # increment score
        
            # Re-sort piles after each operation
            piles.sort()

        return score

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: We start by creating a list called `piles` to hold the sizes of the three piles (`a`, `b`, `c`) and sort it.

2. **Looping Condition**: The `while` loop checks that both the second largest (`piles[1]`) and the largest pile (`piles[2]`) are greater than zero. If they are, we can continue making moves.

3. **Decrement and Score**: Inside the loop, we decrement both the second largest and the largest piles, and increment our score.

4. **Sorting Again**: After each move, we re-sort the piles to ensure that they remain in the correct order for the next iteration.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total `score` which represents the maximum points achieved.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) in terms of the number of operations needed to sort the piles each time, but since we only have three elements, this is effectively constant time O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are only storing a fixed number of variables regardless of the input values.

The code provided should work efficiently within the constraints given in the problem statement, ensuring correctness for all valid inputs.

# 1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums` where the `ith` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:
Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

	
For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.

Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].

- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].

The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].

- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].

- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].

- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].

The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2
Output: 7

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of minimizing the penalty after performing division operations on bags of balls, we can use a binary search strategy combined with a greedy approach. Here's a detailed explanation of how to approach this problem step by step.

### Problem Explanation

We need to perform at most `maxOperations` to divide the bags of balls into new bags while aiming to minimize the maximum number of balls in any bag after the operations.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Penalty Definition:** The penalty is defined as the maximum number of balls in any bag after applying the allowed operations.
2. **Operations on a Bag:** When we split a bag with `x` balls into two bags, the maximum size of the resultant bags will be at most \( \lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil \). 
3. **Binary Search on Penalty:** We can search for the minimum possible penalty (`max balls in a bag`) using binary search. The range for our search will be between 1 and the maximum number of balls in the given bags.
4. **Feasibility Check:** For a candidate penalty `mid`, check how many operations would be required to ensure that no bag has more than `mid` balls.

### Detailed Steps

1. Define a function to check if it's possible to reduce the penalty to a certain value `penalty` with `maxOperations`.
2. Use binary search to hone in on the smallest achievable penalty.
3. Each iteration of the binary search involves checking if we can split the bags to not exceed the current `mid` value.

### Implementation

Here’s the Python code that implements this approach:



```python
def minimumPenalty(nums, maxOperations):
    def canAchievePenalty(penalty):
        operations_required = 0
        for balls in nums:
            # If the current number of balls is greater than the penalty
            if balls > penalty:
                # Calculate how many extra balls we need to split off
                operations_required += (balls - 1) // penalty
        return operations_required <= maxOperations

    left, right = 1, max(nums)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canAchievePenalty(mid):
            right = mid  # We can achieve the penalty, try for a smaller one
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # We cannot achieve this penalty, try a larger one

    return left  # Here, left == right and is the minimum penalty possible

# Example Usage
# Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
# Output: 3
print(minimumPenalty([9], 2))  # Output: 3

# Input: nums = [2, 4, 8, 2], maxOperations = 4
# Output: 2
print(minimumPenalty([2, 4, 8, 2], 4))  # Output: 2

# Input: nums = [7, 17], maxOperations = 2
# Output: 7
print(minimumPenalty([7, 17], 2))  # Output: 7

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function `canAchievePenalty`:** This function computes how many operations are necessary to ensure that no bag exceeds the `penalty` value. It does this by calculating how many times each bag needs to be divided to reduce its count to `penalty` or less.
2. **Binary Search:** We perform binary search between `1` and the maximum number of balls in the input list. In each iteration, we check if dividing the bags can achieve the current midpoint `mid` as the maximum number of balls in a bag.
3. **Final Result:** Once the binary search completes, `left` will hold the smallest penalty possible.

This solution efficiently finds the required minimum penalty in \( O(n \log m) \), where \( n \) is the number of bags and \( m \) is the maximum number of balls in a single bag. This is efficient enough given the constraints of the problem.

# 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio

### Problem Description 
There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`. You know beforehand that in the `ith` class, there are `totali` total students, but only `passi` number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that maximizes the average pass ratio across all the classes.

The pass ratio of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the `extraStudents` students. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.


Example 1:
Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], `extraStudents` = 2
Output: 0.78333
Explanation: You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.


Example 2:
Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], `extraStudents` = 4
Output: 0.53485

Constraints:
`1 <= classes.length <= 105`
`classes[i].length == 2`
`1 <= passi <= totali <= 105`
`1 <= extraStudents <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the average pass ratio of classes by optimally assigning extra students, we can adopt a strategy based on a priority queue (or max heap) to always select the class that will benefit the most from additional students when aiming for an increase in their pass ratio.

### Key Insights:

1. **Pass Ratio Calculation**:
   - For each class, the current pass ratio can be calculated as `passi / totali`.
   - When an extra student is assigned to the class, the new pass ratio becomes `(passi + 1) / (totali + 1)`.
   - The increase in pass ratio can be determined by calculating how much the pass ratio changes when we allocate an extra student to a class.

2. **Using a Max Heap**:
   - To continually allocate extra students to the class that will yield the highest increase in pass ratio, we can use a max heap. Each class will be pushed onto the heap based on the potential benefit of assigning one more student to it.

3. **Greedy Algorithm**:
   - We will loop over our available `extraStudents` and repeatedly assign them to the class that currently offers the highest increase in average pass ratio until we run out of extra students.

### Implementation Steps:

1. Define a max heap to keep track of the classes and their potential increases in pass ratio.
2. Calculate the initial pass ratio for each class and push its potential increment upon receiving an extra student onto the heap.
3. Allocate the extra students one-by-one, always choosing the class that has the highest potential improvement in pass ratio.
4. Finally, compute the final average pass ratio after all extra students have been allocated.

### Python Code:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxAverageRatio(self, classes: List[List[int]], extraStudents: int) -> float:
        # Max heap (using negation to simulate max heap in Python)
        max_heap = []
        
        # Calculate initial ratios and push to the heap
        for passi, totali in classes:
            # Calculate the current increase in pass ratio if one extra student is added
            increment = (passi + 1) / (totali + 1) - passi / totali
            # Push the tuple: negative increment (for max heap), passi, totali
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-increment, passi, totali))
        
        # Distribute the extra students
        for _ in range(extraStudents):
            # Pop the class with the maximum potential gain in pass ratio
            neg_increment, passi, totali = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            # Add an extra student
            passi += 1
            totali += 1
            # Recalculate the new increment and push it back to the heap
            new_increment = (passi + 1) / (totali + 1) - passi / totali
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-new_increment, passi, totali))
        
        # Calculate the total average pass ratio
        total_pass_ratio = 0.0
        for _, passi, totali in max_heap:
            total_pass_ratio += passi / totali
        
        # Average pass ratio
        average_pass_ratio = total_pass_ratio / len(classes)
        return average_pass_ratio

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We import the necessary library `heapq` to utilize heaps.
   - We create a class `Solution` and define the method `maxAverageRatio` which takes `classes` and `extraStudents` as input.

2. **Heap Construction**:
   - We compute the initial potential gain for adding an extra student to each class and store these in a max heap.

3. **Extra Students Allocation**:
   - For each extra student available, we pop the class that currently has the maximum increment in pass ratio from the heap, allocate the student, recalculate the increment, and push the updated class back into the heap.

4. **Final Computation**:
   - Once all students are allocated, we compute the sum of the final pass ratios of all classes and return the average.

This approach ensures we maximize the average pass ratio efficiently and can handle the upper limits of the input size within acceptable time complexity.

# 1801. Number of Orders in the Backlog

### Problem Description 
You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei]` denotes that `amounti` orders have been placed of type `orderTypei` at the price `pricei`. The `orderTypei` is:
`0` if it is a batch of `buy` orders, or
`1` if it is a batch of `sell` orders.

Note that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amounti` independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:
If the order is a `buy` order, you look at the `sell` order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that `sell` order's price is smaller than or equal to the current `buy` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `sell` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `buy` order is added to the backlog.

Vice versa, if the order is a `sell` order, you look at the `buy` order with the largest price in the backlog. If that `buy` order's price is larger than or equal to the current `sell` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `buy` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `sell` order is added to the backlog.

Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.

- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.

- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.

Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.


Example 2:
Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.

- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.

- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.

Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).


Constraints:
`1 <= orders.length <= 105`
`orders[i].length == 3`
`1 <= pricei, amounti <= 109`
`orderTypei` is either `0` or `1`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of managing buy and sell orders in a stock exchange-like scenario, we can effectively use two heaps (priority queues) to manage our buy and sell orders efficiently. Here's a detailed breakdown of how we can implement the solution in Python:

### Approach

1. **Two Heaps**: 
   - A max heap for the buy orders, where we will store buy prices. Python provides only a min heap by default, so we will store the negative values of the prices to simulate a max heap.
   - A min heap for the sell orders, which will naturally work as a min heap.

2. **Processing Orders**: 
   - When we receive a buy order, we check the sell heap for the lowest sell price. If that price is less than or equal to the buy price, execute the order by removing that sell order from the heap and reducing the quantity.
   - When we receive a sell order, we check the buy heap for the highest buy price. If that price is greater than or equal to the sell price, execute the order by removing that buy order from the heap and reducing the quantity.
   - If an order cannot be executed, it gets added to its respective heap.

3. **Backlog Calculation**: 
   - At the end, we will sum the remaining amounts in both heaps and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Implementation

Here’s how you could implement this in Python:



```python
import heapq

def getNumberOfBackloggedOrders(orders):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    buy_heap = []  # Max heap for buy orders (using negative prices)
    sell_heap = []  # Min heap for sell orders
    backlog = 0

    for price, amount, order_type in orders:
        if order_type == 0:  # Buy order
            while amount > 0 and sell_heap and sell_heap[0][0] <= price:
                sell_price, sell_amount = heapq.heappop(sell_heap)
                if sell_amount > amount:
                    backlog += amount
                    sell_amount -= amount
                    backlog %= MOD
                    heapq.heappush(sell_heap, (sell_price, sell_amount))
                    amount = 0
                else:
                    amount -= sell_amount
                    backlog += sell_amount
                    backlog %= MOD
            if amount > 0:
                heapq.heappush(buy_heap, (-price, amount))
        else:  # Sell order
            while amount > 0 and buy_heap and -buy_heap[0][0] >= price:
                buy_price, buy_amount = heapq.heappop(buy_heap)
                buy_amount = -buy_price  # converting back to positive
                if buy_amount > amount:
                    backlog += amount
                    buy_amount -= amount
                    backlog %= MOD
                    heapq.heappush(buy_heap, (-buy_amount, buy_amount))
                    amount = 0
                else:
                    amount -= buy_amount
                    backlog += buy_amount
                    backlog %= MOD
            if amount > 0:
                heapq.heappush(sell_heap, (price, amount))

    # Calculate the total number of orders in the backlog
    while buy_heap:
        price, amount = heapq.heappop(buy_heap)
        backlog += -price * amount
        backlog %= MOD
    while sell_heap:
        price, amount = heapq.heappop(sell_heap)
        backlog += price * amount
        backlog %= MOD

    return backlog

# Example Usage
orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
print(getNumberOfBackloggedOrders(orders))  # Output: 6

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Heap Structures**: The max heap (`buy_heap`) contains the buy prices as negative for max functionality, while `sell_heap` operates normally to retrieve the lowest sell price.
   
2. **Order Processing**: Each order type is checked:
   - For buy orders, we check against the minimum sell order using a loop that runs as long as there are amounts left and compatible orders in the sell heap.
   - For sell orders, we use a similar strategy to check against the maximum buy order.

3. **Final Backlog Calculation**: After processing all orders, we extract remaining values from both heaps to get the final count of backlogged orders. The total is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This implementation is efficient, working in logarithmic time for each insertion and extraction from heaps, resulting in an overall complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

# 1810. Minimum Path Cost in a Hidden Grid

### Problem Description 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.

Each cell has a cost that you need to pay each time you move to the cell. The starting cell's cost is not applied before the robot moves.

You want to find the minimum total cost to move the robot to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the `GridMaster` object.

The `GridMaster` class has the following functions:
`boolean canMove(char direction)` Returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

`int move(char direction)` Moves the robot in that direction and returns the cost of moving to that cell. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, the robot will remain in the same position, and the function will return `-1`.

`boolean isTarget()` Returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'U','D','L','R'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return the minimum total cost to get the robot from its initial starting cell to the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`.

Custom testing:
The test input is read as a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` and four integers `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, and `c2` where:
`grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked.

`grid[i][j] >= 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty and `grid[i][j]` is the cost to move to that cell.

`(r1, c1)` is the starting cell of the robot.

`(r2, c2)` is the target cell of the robot.

Remember that you will not have this information in your code.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2,3],[1,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 1, r2 = 1, c2 = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (0, 1), denoted by the 3.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns true.

- master.canMove('R') returns false.

- master.move('L') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0) and returns 2.

- master.isTarget() returns false.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns false.

- master.canMove('R') returns true.

- master.move('D') moves the robot to the cell (1, 0) and returns 1.

- master.isTarget() returns true.

- master.move('L') doesn't move the robot and returns -1.

- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (1, 1) and returns 1.

We now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the minimum total cost to reach it is 2. 

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,3,1],[3,4,2],[1,2,0]], r1 = 2, c1 = 0, r2 = 0, c2 = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: The minimum cost path is (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2).


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 0, r2 = 1, c2 = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no path from the robot to the target cell.


Constraints:
`1 <= n, m <= 100`
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

### Solution 
 Certainly! To solve the given problem of navigating a robot through a grid while minimizing the cost of movement, we will utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS) due to the constraints and the nature of moving through the grid. In this interactive scenario, the robot has to interact with the `GridMaster` class to determine its movements.

The main components of our solution can be outlined in detail below, following the LeetCode solution format.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, master):
        from collections import deque

        # Directions for movement: Up, Down, Left, Right
        directions = ['U', 'D', 'L', 'R']
        cost = 0
        visited = set()  # To keep track of visited positions
        queue = deque([(0, 0, cost)])  # (x, y, total_cost), start at (0, 0)
        
        visited.add((0, 0))
        
        while queue:
            x, y, total_cost = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if the current cell is the target
            if master.isTarget():
                return total_cost
            
            # Try to move in all four directions
            for i, direction in enumerate(directions):
                if master.canMove(direction):
                    move_cost = master.move(direction)  # Move and get the cost
                    if move_cost != -1:  # Valid move
                        # Calculate the new coordinates based on direction
                        if direction == 'U':
                            new_x, new_y = x - 1, y
                        elif direction == 'D':
                            new_x, new_y = x + 1, y
                        elif direction == 'L':
                            new_x, new_y = x, y - 1
                        elif direction == 'R':
                            new_x, new_y = x, y + 1
                        
                        if (new_x, new_y) not in visited:
                            visited.add((new_x, new_y))
                            queue.append((new_x, new_y, total_cost + move_cost))
                            # Move back to the previous position
                            master.move({'U': 'D', 'D': 'U', 'L': 'R', 'R': 'L'}[direction])  
        
        return -1  # If the target was not reached

```

### Explanation

1. **Data Structures**:
   - **`deque`**: We use a double-ended queue to facilitate efficient popping from the front.
   - **`set`**: Used to track visited cells, preventing cycles and repeated calculations.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The queue starts with the initial position (0, 0) and a cost of 0.
   - The robot’s starting position is assumed to be (0, 0) but it could be adjusted based on movement calls.

3. **BFS Loop**:
   - We use a while loop to process the queue until it’s empty.
   - For each position, we check if the robot is on the target cell using `master.isTarget()`. If it is, we return the current cost.
   - We then attempt to move in the four possible directions (up, down, left, right). The `canMove` method determines if a move is feasible.

4. **Handling Movements**:
   - If a move is successful (`master.move(direction)` returns a cost):
     - Calculate the new (x, y) position based on the direction.
     - If this new position hasn’t been visited, we mark it and add it to the queue with the updated cost.
   - To ensure the robot returns to its previous position after a move, we reverse the direction using a mapping of directions.

5. **Termination**:
   - If the queue is exhausted and the target has not been reached, we return `-1`.

This algorithm effectively explores all possible paths from the starting position to the target using minimal cost, following the interaction rules provided by the `GridMaster` interface. The BFS ensures that we explore all reachable positions layer by layer, making sure we find the minimal cost to reach the target if a path exists.

# 1825. Finding MK Average

### Problem Description 
You are given two integers, `m` and `k`, and a stream of integers. You are tasked to implement a data structure that calculates the MKAverage for the stream.

The MKAverage can be calculated using these steps:
If the number of the elements in the stream is less than `m` you should consider the MKAverage to be `-1`. Otherwise, copy the last `m` elements of the stream to a separate container.

Remove the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements from the container.

Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the nearest integer.

Implement the `MKAverage` class:
`MKAverage(int m, int k)` Initializes the MKAverage object with an empty stream and the two integers `m` and `k`.

`void addElement(int num)` Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.

`int calculateMKAverage()` Calculates and returns the MKAverage for the current stream rounded down to the nearest integer.


Example 1:
Input
["MKAverage", "addElement", "addElement", "calculateMKAverage", "addElement", "calculateMKAverage", "addElement", "addElement", "addElement", "calculateMKAverage"]
[[3, 1], [3], [1], [], [10], [], [5], [5], [5], []]
Output
[null, null, null, -1, null, 3, null, null, null, 5]
Explanation
MKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1); 
obj.addElement(3);        // current elements are [3]
obj.addElement(1);        // current elements are [3,1]
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // return -1, because m = 3 and only 2 elements exist.

obj.addElement(10);       // current elements are [3,1,10]
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [3,1,10].

                          // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be `[3].

                          // The average of [3] equals 3/1 = 3, return 3
obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5]
obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5,5]
obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5,5,5]
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [5,5,5].

                          // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be `[5].

                          // The average of [5] equals 5/1 = 5, return 5
``

Constraints:
`3 <= m <= 105`
`1 <= k*2 < m`
`1 <= num <= 105`
At most `105` calls will be made to `addElement` and `calculateMKAverage`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the MKAverage from a stream of integers, we will implement a class `MKAverage` with the following key attributes and methods:

1. **Attributes**:
   - `m`: The number of elements we consider for the average calculation.
   - `k`: The number of smallest and largest elements to exclude.
   - `stream`: A list to keep track of the integers added to the stream.
  
2. **Methods**:
   - `addElement(num)`: This method will add a new integer to the stream.
   - `calculateMKAverage()`: This method will compute the MKAverage according to the specification. 

### Implementation Strategy
1. If the length of the stream is less than `m`, return `-1`.
2. If there are at least `m` elements, we will take the last `m` elements from the stream.
3. Sort these `m` elements to easily remove the smallest `k` and largest `k`.
4. Compute the average of the remaining elements (after removing the smallest and largest).
5. Return the average rounded down to the nearest integer.

Python provides easy-to-use list and sorting operations, which we will leverage to efficiently implement the logic.

### Python Code



```python
class MKAverage:

    def __init__(self, m: int, k: int):
        self.m = m
        self.k = k
        self.stream = []

    def addElement(self, num: int) -> None:
        self.stream.append(num)

    def calculateMKAverage(self) -> int:
        if len(self.stream) < self.m:
            return -1
        
        # Get the last m elements
        last_m_elements = self.stream[-self.m:]
        
        # Sort these elements to find the smallest k and largest k
        last_m_elements.sort()

        # Remove the smallest k and largest k elements
        relevant_elements = last_m_elements[self.k:self.m - self.k]

        # Calculate the average
        if not relevant_elements:
            return 0  # if there are no elements left after removing k smallest and k largest
        
        mk_average = sum(relevant_elements) // len(relevant_elements)
        return mk_average

```

### Explanation
1. **Constructor `__init__(self, m: int, k: int)`**:
   - It initializes the class with given `m` and `k`.
   - It also initializes an empty list `stream` to store the incoming numbers.

2. **Method `addElement(self, num: int)`**:
   - This method appends `num` to the `stream` list.

3. **Method `calculateMKAverage(self)`**:
   - First, it checks if the number of elements in the `stream` is less than `m`. If it is, the method returns `-1`.
   - It copies the last `m` elements from `stream`, sorts them, and then removes the `k` smallest and `k` largest elements.
   - The remaining elements are used to calculate the average, which is computed as the floor division of the total sum by the count of those elements.
   - Finally, the calculated average is returned.

### Usage
This implementation can be tested with the provided sample input and should yield the expected output. It adheres to the constraints and efficiently handles the operations required, with the sorting step being the most computationally intensive part.
