# 968. Binary Tree Cameras

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.


Example 1:
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.


Example 2:
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:
The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

Every node has value 0.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of placing the minimum number of cameras in a binary tree to ensure every node is monitored, we can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach with a post-order traversal. The key insight here is to define a state for each node based on its camera coverage status.

### Plan
1. **Define States**:
   - `0`: The node is not monitored and doesn't have a camera.
   - `1`: The node has a camera.
   - `2`: The node is monitored but does not have a camera.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - For each node, recursively check its left and right children.
   - Determine whether each child is covered or needs a camera.
   - Based on the states of the children, decide on the state of the current node.

3. **Count Cameras**:
   - Whenever we decide to place a camera, we increment a counter.

4. **Handle Leaf Nodes**:
   - Leaf nodes directly fall into the monitoring logic where they do not have children.

5. **Return the total camera count** after evaluating the whole tree.

### Python Code
The following Python code mimics the LeetCode function structure and can be directly run on the platform:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # Initialize camera count
        self.camera_count = 0
        
        # Define the recursive DFS function
        def dfs(node):
            # If the node is None, it's considered monitored (no camera needed)
            if not node:
                return 2
            
            # Recursively check left and right children
            left = dfs(node.left)
            right = dfs(node.right)
            
            # If either child is not monitored, we need to place a camera.
            if left == 0 or right == 0:
                self.camera_count += 1
                return 1  # This node has a camera
            
            # If either child has a camera, this node is monitored
            if left == 1 or right == 1:
                return 2  # This node is monitored by children’s cameras
            
            # If both children are monitored but do not have cameras, this node is not covered
            return 0
        
        # Start DFS from the root
        if dfs(root) == 0:  # If the root is not monitored, we need an additional camera
            self.camera_count += 1
        
        return self.camera_count

# Example of how to use the class
# Construct a binary tree e.g. [0,0,null,0,0]
root = TreeNode(0)
root.left = TreeNode(0)
root.left.left = TreeNode(0)
root.right = TreeNode(0)

solution = Solution()
print(solution.minCameraCover(root))  # Output should be 1

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:
- **TreeNode Class**: This class represents a node in the tree.
- **Solution Class**: Contains the `minCameraCover` method.
  - We declare a counter (`self.camera_count`) to keep track of the number of cameras placed.
  - The `dfs` function uses recursion to traverse the tree and determine the camera coverage state for each node.
  - Different return values (0, 1, 2) indicate whether a node is unmonitored, has a camera, or is monitored. 
  - Finally, we start our DFS on the root and check if the root needs a camera; if it does, we increment the count accordingly.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, for the recursion stack.

This structured approach ensures efficient monitoring while minimizing the number of cameras used.

# 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal

### Problem Description 
You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given a sequence of `n` values `voyage`, which is the desired pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

Any node in the binary tree can be flipped by swapping its left and right subtrees. For example, flipping node 1 will have the following effect:
Flip the smallest number of nodes so that the pre-order traversal of the tree matches `voyage`.

Return a list of the values of all flipped nodes. You may return the answer in any order. If it is impossible to flip the nodes in the tree to make the pre-order traversal match `voyage`, return the list `[-1]`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: It is impossible to flip the nodes such that the pre-order traversal matches voyage.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]
Output: [1]
Explanation: Flipping node 1 swaps nodes 2 and 3, so the pre-order traversal matches voyage.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The tree's pre-order traversal already matches voyage, so no nodes need to be flipped.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.

`n == voyage.length`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= Node.val, voyage[i] <= n`
All the values in the tree are unique.

All the values in `voyage` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of flipping nodes in a binary tree to match a given pre-order traversal, we can utilize a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main idea is to traverse the tree while checking if the current node matches the expected value from the `voyage` list, and if there's a mismatch, we need to track that we should flip the left and right subtrees.

Here's a detailed plan:

1. **Tree Traversal:** Utilize recursion to traverse the tree in a pre-order manner (visit the root, then the left subtree, and then the right subtree).
  
2. **Matching Voyage:** For each node visited, check if its value matches the current position in the `voyage`. If it doesn't match, return `[-1]` indicating it’s impossible to achieve the desired traversal.

3. **Flips:** If the value matches but does not match what we expect for the left child in the `voyage`, this indicates that we would need to flip the tree. We will record the node value that we flipped.

4. **Return Values:** If we successfully match the `voyage`, return all flipped node values. If at any point we encounter a mismatch with the expected node values in the `voyage`, we return `[-1]`.

Here is the implementation based on the above approach:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def flipMatchVoyage(self, root: TreeNode, voyage: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Result list to keep track of flipped nodes
        flipped = []
        
        # Current index we are checking in voyage
        self.index = 0
        
        # DFS function to traverse the tree
        def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> bool:
            if not node:
                return True
            if node.val != voyage[self.index]:
                return False
            
            # Move to the next index in voyage
            self.index += 1
            
            # Check left child value in voyage to know if we need a flip
            if (node.left and self.index < len(voyage) 
                and node.left.val != voyage[self.index]):
                # It's needed to flip the node
                flipped.append(node.val)
                # We must visit the right child first due to the flip
                return dfs(node.right) and dfs(node.left)
            
            # No flip needed, simply go left first
            return dfs(node.left) and dfs(node.right)
        
        if not dfs(root):
            return [-1]
        
        return flipped

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), None)
# voyage = [2, 1]
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.flipMatchVoyage(root, voyage))  # Output: [-1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **TreeNode Class:** A simple class to represent each node in the binary tree.

2. **Solution Class:** Contains the main method `flipMatchVoyage`, which initiates the solution process.

3. **Flipped List:** A list to hold the values of nodes that we flip.

4. **dfs Function:** This is the recursive function that ensures the tree is traversed in a pre-order manner. It:
   - Checks for `None` nodes, returning `True`.
   - Checks if the current node value matches the `voyage` at the current index.
   - If there’s a mismatch, it returns `False`.
   - If the left child value and the expected next in `voyage` don’t match, it appends the current node’s value to `flipped` and processes the right child first.

5. **Result Handling:** The initial call to `dfs` will return `False` if a mismatch is encountered, and in that case, the output will be `[-1]`. If the traversal completes successfully, we return the list of flipped nodes.

This solution follows the format expected in a LeetCode submission, and it can be run directly on their platform.

# 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes where each `node` in the tree has `node.val` coins and there are `n` coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. (A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)
Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.


Example 2:
Input: root = [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,0,2]
Output: 2

Example 4:
Input: root = [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.

`1 <= n <= 100`
`0 <= Node.val <= n`
The sum of `Node.val` is `n`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of moving coins in a binary tree such that each node ends up with exactly one coin, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS). The idea is to traverse the tree, calculate deviations (i.e., excess or deficit of coins) for each node, and aggregate the moves required to balance these deviations.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: Each node in the tree can have children (left and right). Given that we want every node to end up with exactly one coin, we need to ensure that if a node has more coins than its children need, we move the excess down to them, and if it has fewer, we need to pull the coins from its children.

2. **Calculating Moves**: As we traverse each node:
   - If a node has more than one coin, we can potentially move the excess down to its children.
   - Conversely, if it has fewer coins, it needs to pull coins from its children.
   - We will count the moves required to balance the coins at each node and accumulate the counts as we return up the recursive stack.

3. **Recursion**: We will write a recursive function that returns the "net balance" of coins for each node while also keeping track of the "moves" needed to balance coins.

Here is how we would implement this solution:

### Python Code:
The following code is designed to run directly on the LeetCode platform:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def distributeCoins(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.moves = 0
        
        def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> int:
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            # Get the imbalance from left and right children
            left_balance = dfs(node.left)
            right_balance = dfs(node.right)
            
            # Calculate the balance at this node
            total_balance = node.val + left_balance + right_balance - 1
            
            # The number of moves is how much we need to shift to balance
            self.moves += abs(left_balance) + abs(right_balance)
            
            return total_balance
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.moves

```

### Code Explanation:

- **TreeNode Class**: This is the definition of the tree node. Each node has a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).

- **Solution class**: We define a `Solution` class with the `distributeCoins` method.
  
- **distributeCoins Method**: It initializes a counter for moves (`self.moves`) and then defines a nested helper function `dfs` to perform a depth-first traversal.

- **DFS Function**:
    - If the node is `None`, it returns `0` (no coins, no excess/deficit).
    - It recursively computes the balances of the left and right subtrees.
    - The balance at the current node is calculated as `node.val + left_balance + right_balance - 1`. Here, we subtract `1` because we want each node to have exactly one coin.
    - The total number of moves is updated by adding the absolute values of left and right balances, as they represent moves needed to bring coins up to or down from the node.
    
- Finally, the `dfs` function is called with the root, and the number of moves is returned.

This code provides an efficient and clear method to solve the problem of distributing coins within a binary tree.

# 980. Unique Paths III

### Problem Description 
On a 2-dimensional `grid`, there are 4 types of squares:
`1` represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.

`2` represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.

`0` represents empty squares we can walk over.

`-1` represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.


Example 1:
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)

Example 2:
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)

Example 3:
Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.

Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.

Note:
`1 <= grid.length * grid[0].length <= 20`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of distinct walks from a starting square to an ending square while visiting every non-obstacle square exactly once on a 2D grid, we can utilize a backtracking approach. Here's a detailed solution that you can directly run on LeetCode.

### Explanation:

1. **Identify Key Points**: First, we need to identify the starting point (denoted by `1`), the ending point (denoted by `2`), and count all non-obstacle squares (denoted by `0` or `1`).

2. **Backtracking Function**: We will create a recursive function that attempts to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current position. This function will check if the next position is valid (i.e., within bounds, not an obstacle, and not previously visited).

3. **Base Case**: The recursion will terminate when we reach the ending point. At this point, we check if we have visited the total number of non-obstacle squares.

4. **Marking Visited Squares**: We will keep track of visited squares with a set (or modify the grid temporarily) to ensure we don't visit them more than once during a single path exploration.

5. **Return Count**: For each valid path found that satisfies all conditions, we will increment our path count.

### Implementation:

Here’s how we can implement this in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsIII(self, grid):
        # Directions for movement: right, left, down, up
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        
        # Initialize variables
        start_x = start_y = end_x = end_y = 0
        empty_count = 0
        
        # Find the start, end points and count the empty squares
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    start_x, start_y = i, j
                elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                    end_x, end_y = i, j
                if grid[i][j] != -1:  # Count all non-obstacle squares
                    empty_count += 1
        
        # Backtracking function
        def backtrack(x, y, count):
            # If we reach the ending square
            if (x, y) == (end_x, end_y):
                # Check if we visited all non-obstacle cells
                return 1 if count == empty_count else 0
            
            # Temporarily mark the cell as visited
            temp = grid[x][y]
            grid[x][y] = -1  # Mark as visited
            paths = 0
            
            # Explore all four directions
            for dx, dy in directions:
                new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]) and grid[new_x][new_y] != -1:
                    paths += backtrack(new_x, new_y, count + 1)
            
            # Backtrack: unmark the cell
            grid[x][y] = temp
            return paths
        
        # Start backtracking from the starting point with count as 1 (for the starting square)
        return backtrack(start_x, start_y, 1)

```

### How the Code Works:

1. **Initialization**: We parse the grid to locate the starting and ending squares and count empty squares.

2. **Backtracking Logic**: 
   - If we reach the end square, we check if we counted all non-obstacle squares.
   - We temporarily mark squares as visited to avoid cycles during exploration and backtrack afterward.

3. **Returning the Result**: The number of valid paths is returned based on the recursive exploration.

This implementation should efficiently solve the problem by systematically exploring all possible valid paths while adhering to the constraints of visiting every non-obstacle square exactly once. The time complexity is generally manageable due to the constraints given that the maximum grid size can be \(20\), allowing for exhaustive searching strategies like backtracking.

# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position `(row, col)`, its left and right children will be at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` respectively. The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.

Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.

Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.

Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.

Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.

Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.

          1 is at the top, so it comes first.

          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.

Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.

Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.

Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can leverage a breadth-first search (BFS) approach while using a dictionary to keep track of nodes at each column. We will also consider the row indices to ensure a top-to-bottom ordering where necessary.

Here is a detailed explanation followed by the implementation:

### Explanation

1. **Data Structure**: 
   - We will use a dictionary `column_table` where the key is the column index and the value is a list of tuples containing the row index and the node value.
   - We will also use a queue to perform BFS, which helps us traverse the tree level by level.

2. **Column and Row Tracking**:
   - We define the position of the root node as `(0, 0)`, where `0` is the column index, and `0` is the row index.
   - For each node:
     - The left child will be at `(row + 1, col - 1)`.
     - The right child will be at `(row + 1, col + 1)`.

3. **BFS Implementation**:
   - We start with the root node at position `(0, 0)`.
   - For each node processed, we add its value and position (row and value) to `column_table`.
   - Finally, after BFS is complete, we need to sort the entries by their column indices, and within the same column, we sort by row index and then value.

4. **Result Formatting**:
   - We will extract the values from the column_table, ensuring the final output adheres to the specified vertical order.

### Python Code
Here is how the solution would look in Python following the LeetCode format:



```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        column_table = defaultdict(list)
        queue = deque([(root, 0, 0)])  # (node, row, column)

        while queue:
            node, row, column = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                column_table[column].append((row, node.val))  # store (row, value)
                queue.append((node.left, row + 1, column - 1))  # left child
                queue.append((node.right, row + 1, column + 1))  # right child
        
        # Sort the column_table and prepare final result
        sorted_columns = sorted(column_table.keys())
        result = []
        
        for col in sorted_columns:
            # Sort by row first, then by the node values
            column_nodes = sorted(column_table[col], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
            result.append([val for row, val in column_nodes])

        return result

```

### How to Run on LeetCode
1. **TreeNode Definition**: The `TreeNode` class is defined to create instances of tree nodes.
2. **Solution Class**: The `verticalTraversal` method of the `Solution` class implements the logic described.
3. **Input Data**: LeetCode provides the `root` of the binary tree in the prescribed format, so you can directly run this function as part of their testing interface.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes. This is due to the sorting of nodes within each column.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), required for the queue and column table storage.

This solution effectively gathers nodes in vertical order, sorts them accordingly, and yields the desired output format.

# 988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node has a value from `0` to `25` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`: a value of `0` represents `'a'`, a value of `1` represents `'b'`, and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, `"ab"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aba"`.  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)

Example 1:
Input: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
Output: "dba"

Example 2:
Input: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
Output: "adz"

Example 3:
Input: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
Output: "abc"
Note:
The number of nodes in the given tree will be between `1` and `8500`.

Each node in the tree will have a value between `0` and `25`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest string from leaves to the root of a binary tree where each node's value corresponds to a letter (0 being 'a' and 25 being 'z'), we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The DFS will allow us to traverse all paths from leaves to the root, collecting characters along the way and then comparing the formed strings to determine the smallest one.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Tree Representation**: The binary tree is represented as a collection of nodes where each node has a value (0-25). This can be represented using a class structure in Python.

2. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a DFS from the root node, traversing down to each leaf node. While traversing, we will construct the string in reverse (from leaf to root) since we need the string to start at the leaf and end at the root.

3. **Storing Results**: We need to store the strings formed from each leaf to the root, and at each leaf, we will check if the current string is lexicographically smaller than the previously stored smallest string.

4. **Output**: After the traversal is completed, we will return the smallest string found.

Here's the code that implements this logic:



```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def smallestFromLeaf(self, root: TreeNode) -> str:
        # This variable will store the smallest string found
        self.smallest_string = None
        
        # Function to do the DFS
        def dfs(node, current_string):
            if node is None:
                return
            
            # Prepend the current character to the path
            current_string = chr(node.val + ord('a')) + current_string
            
            # Check if it's a leaf node
            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                if self.smallest_string is None or current_string < self.smallest_string:
                    self.smallest_string = current_string
            
            # Recur for left and right children
            dfs(node.left, current_string)
            dfs(node.right, current_string)
        
        # Start DFS with an empty string from the root
        dfs(root, "")
        
        return self.smallest_string if self.smallest_string is not None else ""

# Sample usage:
# To use this solution, create an instance of TreeNode to represent the tree structure 
# and pass the root to the Solution().smallestFromLeaf method.


```

### Explanation of the Code: 
- We define a `TreeNode` class that has three attributes: `val`, `left`, and `right`.
- The `Solution` class contains the main method `smallestFromLeaf`, which initializes `self.smallest_string` to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string found during traversal.
- The `dfs` function is a recursive function that builds the string as it traverses down the tree. When it reaches a leaf (a node without left and right children), it checks whether the formed string is smaller than the previously stored string and updates `self.smallest_string` accordingly.
- Finally, if the smallest string is found, it's returned; otherwise, an empty string is returned.

The above code provides a clear and efficient method to solve the problem using the DFS technique. The code is ready to be run on LeetCode or other similar platforms.

# 1020. Number of Enclaves

### Problem Description 
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where `0` represents a sea cell and `1` represents a land cell.

A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the `grid`.

Return the number of land cells in `grid` for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.


Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 500`
`grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of land cells (`1`s) in a binary matrix that cannot reach the boundary, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to mark the land cells that are connected to the boundary. This will allow us to subsequently count the remaining land cells that are enclosed by water (`0`s).

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Input Representation**: The input matrix is represented as a list of lists where `0` indicates sea and `1` indicates land.

2. **Boundary Cells**: The cells on the boundary (first and last rows, and first and last columns) can directly connect to the outside. Thus, we need to initiate our DFS from these boundary cells.

3. **DFS Approach**:
   - We will first create a function that performs DFS starting from the boundary land cells, marking them as visited (by changing their value from `1` to `0`).
   - When we encounter a `1`, we explore its neighbors 4-directionally.
   - We will mark all reachable land cells (which can connect to boundary) by changing their value to `0`.

4. **Counting Enclosed Land Cells**: After running DFS from boundary cells, the remaining `1`s in the matrix will be the cells that cannot reach the boundary. Simply count these cells at the end.

### The Code:

Here is the implementation of this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def numEnclaves(self, grid):
        if not grid:
            return 0

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def dfs(x, y):
            if x < 0 or x >= m or y < 0 or y >= n or grid[x][y] == 0:
                return
            # Mark the cell as visited (as sea)
            grid[x][y] = 0
            # Explore all four directions
            dfs(x + 1, y)  # Down
            dfs(x - 1, y)  # Up
            dfs(x, y + 1)  # Right
            dfs(x, y - 1)  # Left

        # Start DFS from the boundary land cells
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i == 0 or i == m - 1 or j == 0 or j == n - 1) and grid[i][j] == 1:
                    dfs(i, j)

        # Count the number of land cells (1s) that are left
        count = sum(row.count(1) for row in grid)
        
        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We determine the dimensions of the grid and define a helper function for DFS.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - It takes coordinates `x` and `y`, checks if it's out of bounds or if it's a `0`.
   - If it's a `1`, it marks it as visited by changing it to `0` and calls itself recursively on its four adjacent cells.

3. **Marking Boundary Cells**: We loop through every cell in the first and last rows or columns to invoke DFS on `1`s.

4. **Counting Remaining `1`s**: After marking all reachable land cells, we count the remaining `1`s in the grid, which represents the enclosed land cells.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the count of land cells that cannot reach the boundary.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns, because in the worst case, we might need to examine every cell.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case for the recursion stack in DFS, although the in-place marking reduces the need for extra space. 

This code can be run directly on the LeetCode website as it follows the required format.

# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `V` for which there exist different nodes `A` and `B` where `V = |A.val - B.val|` and `A` is an ancestor of `B`.

A node `A` is an ancestor of `B` if either: any child of `A` is equal to `B`, or any child of `A` is an ancestor of `B`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 5000]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum value `V` where `V = |A.val - B.val|` for different nodes `A` and `B` in a binary tree where `A` is an ancestor of `B`, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. Here’s the detailed explanation of the method we will employed:

### Approach:

1. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a DFS starting from the root node while keeping track of the minimum and maximum values encountered along the path from the root to the current node.

2. **Update the Maximum Difference**: At each node, we will calculate the potential maximum difference with its value against the tracked minimum and maximum values from the path. We will update our result accordingly.

3. **Continue the Traversal**: We will recursively call the DFS on the left and right children of the current node, passing in the updated minimum and maximum values.

4. **Base Cases**: The function will return when we reach a leaf node (i.e., there are no further children), ensuring that we cover all paths in the tree.

### Implementation:

Here’s the Python code following the LeetCode format, which can be directly run on the LeetCode website:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # Initial call to the DFS helper function
        return self.dfs(root, root.val, root.val)

    def dfs(self, node: TreeNode, min_val: int, max_val: int) -> int:
        if not node:
            # Return the difference between the max and min we found
            return max_val - min_val
        
        # Update the max and min for the path
        min_val = min(min_val, node.val)
        max_val = max(max_val, node.val)
        
        # Recursive calls for left and right children
        left_diff = self.dfs(node.left, min_val, max_val)
        right_diff = self.dfs(node.right, min_val, max_val)
        
        # Return the maximum difference found in this path
        return max(left_diff, right_diff)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **TreeNode Class**: This defines the structure of a node in the binary tree. It has three attributes: `val`, `left`, and `right`.

- **Solution Class**: This contains the main logic. The function `maxAncestorDiff` initializes the DFS process by starting from the root node and passing its value as both the initial minimum and maximum.

- **DFS Function**:
  - **Parameters**:
    - `node`: The current node being processed.
    - `min_val`: The minimum value seen on the current path from the root to this node.
    - `max_val`: The maximum value seen on the current path from the root to this node.
  - **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, it returns the difference between `max_val` and `min_val`, which gives the maximum difference for the current branch of the tree.
  - **Value Updates**: For each node, it updates `min_val` and `max_val` based on the current node’s value.
  - **Recursive Calls**: It processes the left and right children of the node.
  - **Return Maximum Difference**: Finally, it returns the larger difference found either from the left or the right subtree.

### Why This Works:
This approach explores all possible paths in the tree starting from the root to its leaves, and calculates the maximum ancestor-node difference efficiently in a single traversal of the tree with O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of nodes in the tree, and O(H) space complexity for the call stack, where H is the height of the tree.

This code is optimal and satisfies the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal

### Problem Description 
We run a preorder depth-first search (DFS) on the `root` of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output `D` dashes (where `D` is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  If the depth of a node is `D`, the depth of its immediate child is `D + 1`.  The depth of the `root` node is `0`.

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.

Given the output `S` of this traversal, recover the tree and return its `root`.


Example 1:
Input: S = "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
Output: [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]

Example 2:
Input: S = "1-2--3---4-5--6---7"
Output: [1,2,5,3,null,6,null,4,null,7]

Example 3:
Input: S = "1-401--349---90--88"
Output: [1,401,null,349,88,90]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the original tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.

`1 <= Node.val <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of reconstructing a binary tree from its preorder depth-first search (DFS) traversal output with specified dashes indicating depth, we can follow the LeetCode solution format. Below is the Python code, complete with a detailed explanation of the approach used.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Input Format**: 
   - The string `S` represents the preorder traversal of the binary tree where each node's depth is represented by dashes (`-`). For example, `--` indicates a depth of 2.
   - The first character is the value of the root node, and subsequent characters follow the depth structure format.

2. **Recursive Tree Construction**:
   - We will maintain an index while parsing the string and a stack that tracks the nodes we have added to the tree.
   - We will also track the current depth of the node we are constructing.
   - The root is found at the starting position and we’ll recursively find its children based on the depth indicated by the dashes.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If we have traversed all characters in the string, we stop the recursion.
   - We create a new tree node whenever we find a non-dash character and update our stack accordingly.

### Implementation

Here is the code that reflects the above logic:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def recoverFromPreorder(self, S: str) -> TreeNode:
        stack = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(S):
            depth = 0
            
            # Calculate the depth
            while i < len(S) and S[i] == '-':
                depth += 1
                i += 1
            
            # Now, find the value
            start = i
            while i < len(S) and S[i].isdigit():
                i += 1
            
            value = int(S[start:i])  # Extract the number
            node = TreeNode(value)  # Create the new node
            
            # If depth is greater than stack size, it goes deeper
            if depth == len(stack):
                if stack:
                    # Attach to the last node in the stack as the left child
                    stack[-1].left = node
                # Push the current node onto the stack
                stack.append(node)
            else:
                # If we are going back up, we pop stack until we find the right depth
                while len(stack) > depth:
                    stack.pop()
                # Attach as the right child of the last node at the correct depth
                stack[-1].right = node
                # Push the current node onto the stack
                stack.append(node)
        
        # The bottom-most node in the stack is the root
        return stack[0]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first define a `TreeNode` class to represent each node of the tree.
- The main function `recoverFromPreorder` reads the string `S`, calculates the depth, and constructs the tree:
  - We loop through the string while counting the dashes to determine the depth of the current node.
  - After dashes, we read the value of the node and create a new `TreeNode`.
  - We manage the `stack` to ensure nodes are added in the correct hierarchical structure.
  - Finally, we return the root node which will be at the bottom of the stack after processing is complete.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the string S, as we go through each character in the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case due to the potential storage of all nodes in the stack.

This solution should work efficiently within the given constraints of the problem (up to 1000 nodes). You can directly paste this code into the LeetCode environment, ensuring the tree node class is defined to test the inputs as demonstrated in the examples.

# 1034. Coloring A Border

### Problem Description 
Given a 2-dimensional `grid` of integers, each value in the grid represents the color of the grid square at that location.

Two squares belong to the same connected component if and only if they have the same color and are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.

The border of a connected component is all the squares in the connected component that are either 4-directionally adjacent to a square not in the component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).

Given a square at location `(r0, c0)` in the grid and a `color`, color the border of the connected component of that square with the given `color`, and return the final `grid`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 0, color = 3
Output: [[3, 3], [3, 2]]

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,2,2],[2,3,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 1, color = 3
Output: [[1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 3]]

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], r0 = 1, c0 = 1, color = 2
Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
Note:
`1 <= grid.length <= 50`
`1 <= grid[0].length <= 50`
`1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
`0 <= r0 < grid.length`
`0 <= c0 < grid[0].length`
`1 <= color <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of coloring the border of a connected component in a 2D grid, we need to identify the connected component starting from the given `(r0, c0)` location. After identifying the component, we will change the border squares to the specified new color while leaving the rest of the component unchanged.

Here's how we can approach the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the connected component**: We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find all the squares connected to the starting square `(r0, c0)` that have the same initial color.

2. **Mark the borders**: A border square is defined as either being adjacent to a different color or being on the edge of the grid. We'll go through the identified component and check the conditions for each square to determine if it is a border square.

3. **Update the grid**: Finally, we change the border squares' colors to the given `color` while ensuring the inner squares of the connected component retain their original color.

Here's the implementation of this approach in Python, formatted to run on the LeetCode platform:



```python
class Solution:
    def colorBorder(self, grid: List[List[int]], r0: int, c0: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        original_color = grid[r0][c0]
        visited = set()
        border = set()
        
        # Directions for 4-directional movement
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

        def is_border(r, c):
            if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols:
                return True
            return grid[r][c] != original_color
        
        def dfs(r, c):
            visited.add((r, c))
            is_current_border = False
            
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if is_border(nr, nc):
                    is_current_border = True
                elif (nr, nc) not in visited and 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == original_color:
                    dfs(nr, nc)
                    
            if is_current_border:
                border.add((r, c))

        dfs(r0, c0)
        
        # Color the border
        for r, c in border:
            grid[r][c] = color
        
        # Return the modified grid
        return grid

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We get the number of rows and columns from the grid.
   - We store the original color of the square at `(r0, c0)`.
   - Two sets `visited` and `border` are initialized to keep track of visited squares and border squares, respectively.

2. **Direction Vectors**: 
   - We define the possible moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) using a list of tuples.

3. **is_border Function**:
   - This function checks whether a square is a border square, considering edges of the grid and adjacent different colors.

4. **dfs Function**:
   - The depth-first search function explores all connected squares that share the original color.
   - While exploring, it checks if a square is a border.
   - If it's adjacent to a different color or to the edge of the grid, it marks it as a border.

5. **Color the Border**:
   - After identifying all the border squares, we iterate through the `border` set and set those squares in the grid to the given `color`.

6. **Output**: 
   - Finally, we return the modified grid.

This approach is efficient given the constraints and keeps the code clear and understandable. It uses DFS to explore and marks the grid properly.

# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Note: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

Example 2:
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,0,2]
Output: [3,3,2]

Example 4:
Input: root = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [7,9,4,10]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 100`
All the values in the tree are unique.

`root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of converting a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a Greater Tree, we need to modify the value of each node in such a way that it becomes the sum of its original value plus the values of all nodes that contain values greater than its original value.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   In a Binary Search Tree, for any given node:
   - All the values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
   - All the values in the left subtree are lesser.
   
   To convert the BST to a Greater Tree, we need to perform a reverse in-order traversal (visit right subtree, then current node, then left subtree) because we want to first access the larger values (on the right) before processing the current node.

2. **In-order Traversal Approach**:
   - We will maintain a running sum (`total`) that adds up the values as we traverse the tree.
   - When we visit a node, we will update its value to the running total, and then add its original value to this total to ensure the next nodes that we visit will include it in their sum.

3. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement a recursive function that does this traversal and updating of the nodes.

Here is the Python code that follows the LeetCode solution format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def convertBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # Variable to keep track of the cumulative sum
        self.total = 0

        def traverse(node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Traverse the right subtree first (greater values)
            traverse(node.right)

            # Update the current node's value
            self.total += node.val
            node.val = self.total

            # Traverse the left subtree (smaller values)
            traverse(node.left)

        traverse(root)
        return root

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:

1. **TreeNode Class**: 
   - This is the definition of the TreeNode class, which represents each node in the BST with attributes for the value (`val`), left child (`left`), and right child (`right`).

2. **Solution Class**:
   - Contains the method `convertBST`, which takes the root of the BST as input.
   - Initializes a class variable `self.total` to keep track of the running total of node values.

3. **Traverse Function**:
   - This function is defined within `convertBST` and performs the traversal:
     - If the current node is `None`, it returns (base case of recursion).
     - First, it recursively traverses the right child to process all greater values.
     - Then, it adds the current node's value to `self.total`, and assigns the updated total to the node's value.
     - Finally, it recursively traverses the left child to process all smaller values.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - After completing the traversal and modifications, it returns the modified root of the tree.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H) for the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (skewed tree), this can go up to O(N), but in a balanced tree it would be O(log N).

### Conclusion:
This method efficiently converts a Binary Search Tree to a Greater Tree using a simple reverse in-order traversal while maintaining a running total of node values.

# 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination

### Problem Description 
Given the `edges` of a directed graph where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`, and two nodes `source` and `destination` of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`, that is:
At least one path exists from the `source` node to the `destination` node
If a path exists from the `source` node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to `destination`.

The number of possible paths from `source` to `destination` is a finite number.

Return `true` if and only if all roads from `source` lead to `destination`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.


Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: All paths from the source node end at the destination node, but there are an infinite number of paths, such as 0-1-2, 0-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-1-2, and so on.


Example 5:
Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1],[1,1]], source = 0, destination = 1
Output: false
Explanation: There is infinite self-loop at destination node.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 104`
`0 <= edges.length <= 104`
`edges.length == 2`
`0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
`0 <= source <= n - 1`
`0 <= destination <= n - 1`
The given graph may have self-loops and parallel edges.

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem, we need to determine if all paths from a source node in a directed graph lead to a destination node. We can approach this problem by using Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the paths from the `source` node. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, followed by the code in LeetCode format.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each node points to a list of nodes it can reach via directed edges.

2. **DFS for Path Exploration**:
   - Implement a DFS function that will traverse the graph. During the traversal, we need to consider the following:
     - If we reach the destination node, we can safely return as one valid path has been found.
     - If we encounter a node that has outgoing edges, we need to traverse its neighbors recursively.
     - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and ensure we don’t get stuck.

3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - If we reach any node that has outgoing edges and is not the destination, then this means we have paths that do not end at the destination.
   - If we reach a node with no outgoing edges and it is not the destination, then we cannot satisfy the problem's conditions.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If, after exploring all paths from the source, we find paths that can terminate and do not fulfill our condition, we return False. Otherwise, we return True.

### Implementation:

Here is the Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def leadsToDestination(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
        
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Step 1: Build the adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
        
        # Visited states
        visited = [0] * n  # 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited
        
        def dfs(node):
            if visited[node] == 1:  # Node is currently being visited - cycle detected
                return False
            if visited[node] == 2:  # Node has already been fully visited
                return True
            
            visited[node] = 1  # Mark the node as visiting
            
            if node == destination:
                # We reached the destination, we need to check if it has outgoing edges
                if len(graph[node]) > 0:
                    # Destination shouldn't have any outgoing edges; otherwise, it'll fail
                    return False
                visited[node] = 2
                return True
            
            # Check all the connected nodes
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not dfs(neighbor):
                    return False
            
            visited[node] = 2  # Mark the node as fully visited
            return True
        
        # Run DFS from the source node
        return dfs(source)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Graph Creation**:
   - We create an adjacency list using `defaultdict` where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes it can reach.

2. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The `dfs` function explores nodes recursively and uses a `visited` list to track the state of each node:
     - **0** for unvisited,
     - **1** for visiting,
     - **2** for fully visited.
   - When we reach the destination, we check if it has any outgoing edges; if yes, we return `False`.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - During our exploration (`dfs`), if we revisit a node that is marked as currently visiting, then we have detected a cycle, and we return `False`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - The function returns `True` if all paths from the `source` lead to the `destination`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The provided solution efficiently handles the constraints and checks all necessary conditions to determine if the paths from the source node lead to the destination node as specified in the problem statement.

# 1080. Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, consider all root to leaf paths: paths from the root to any leaf.  (A leaf is a node with no children.)
A `node` is insufficient if every such root to leaf path intersecting this `node` has sum strictly less than `limit`.

Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,-99,-99,7,8,9,-99,-99,12,13,-99,14], limit = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,null,null,7,8,9,null,14]

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,1,null,null,5,3], limit = 22
Output: [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,null,null,null,5]

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,-3,-5,null,4,null], limit = -1
Output: [1,null,-3,4]
Note:
The given tree will have between `1` and `5000` nodes.

`-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5`
`-10^9 <= limit <= 10^9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of deleting insufficient nodes from a binary tree based on root-to-leaf paths and their sums, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of each root-to-leaf path, checking if the sums meet a specified limit. If a node is deemed insufficient (i.e., every path through that node has a sum that is less than the limit), we will remove it.

Here’s how we can approach the solution:

1. **Define a Recursive Function**: We'll write a helper function that will traverse the tree and calculate the path sums. This function will return the sum of the paths and help us to determine if a node is insufficient.

2. **Checking Leaf Nodes**: If we reach a leaf node (i.e., a node without children), we will compare the current path sum to the limit. If this leaf node results in a path sum that meets or exceeds the limit, we will ensure that this information propagates back up the tree.

3. **Nullifying Insufficient Nodes**: If a node does not satisfy the requirement of having any paths that meet the limit, we want it to be removed (or turned into `None`).

4. **Return of the Updated Tree**: Finally, we start from the root and return the modified tree where insufficient nodes have been removed.

Here's how this logic is implemented in Python:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sufficientSubset(self, root: TreeNode, limit: int) -> TreeNode:
        """
        This function will delete insufficient nodes from the binary tree.
        :param root: The root of the binary tree.
        :param limit: The limit to compare path sums against.
        :return: The root of the modified tree.
        """
        
        def dfs(node: TreeNode, current_sum: int) -> int:
            if not node:
                return current_sum
            
            current_sum += node.val
            
            # If we are at a leaf node, determine if its path is sufficient
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return current_sum
            
            # Recursively calculate sums for left and right children
            left_sum = dfs(node.left, current_sum)
            right_sum = dfs(node.right, current_sum)
            
            # If both left and right paths are insufficient, return None for this node
            if left_sum < limit and right_sum < limit:
                return float('-inf')  # node is insufficient
            
            # If the current node is insufficient, it should be nullified
            if left_sum < limit:
                node.left = None  # Remove the left child
            
            if right_sum < limit:
                node.right = None  # Remove the right child
            
            # Return the maximum sum obtained through this node
            return max(left_sum, right_sum)
        
        # Start the recursion with the root and an initial sum of 0
        return root if dfs(root, 0) >= limit else None

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **TreeNode Class**: This is a typical class definition for a binary tree node with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.

2. **sufficientSubset Method**: This is the main method that will be called to find and remove insufficient nodes. It initializes the recursive method `dfs` with the root node and a starting sum of 0.

3. **dfs Function**:
   - The function takes a node and the cumulative sum of the path leading to it.
   - It adjusts the `current_sum` by adding the current node's value.
   - If a leaf node is reached, it returns the current path sum.
   - It recursively calls itself on the left and right children to get their path sums.
   - It checks if both children are insufficient and returns a marker (`-inf`) to indicate that the current node is also insufficient.
   - It conditionally nullifies the children if they are deemed insufficient.
   - It returns the maximum path sum that can be formed through this node to its parent.

### Edge Cases:
- If the entire tree needs to be removed (i.e., when the root itself is insufficient), the return is `None`.

This solution runs efficiently and meets the problem constraints, allowing for a quick validation of path sums and modification of the binary tree in place.

# 1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value

### Problem Description 
Given a matrix of integers `A` with R rows and C columns, find the maximum score of a path starting at `[0,0]` and ending at `[R-1,C-1]`.

The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.  For example, the value of the path 8 →  4 →  5 →  9 is 4.

A path moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west, south).


Example 1:
Input: [[5,4,5],[1,2,6],[7,4,6]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The path with the maximum score is highlighted in yellow. 

Example 2:
Input: [[2,2,1,2,2,2],[1,2,2,2,1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: [[3,4,6,3,4],[0,2,1,1,7],[8,8,3,2,7],[3,2,4,9,8],[4,1,2,0,0],[4,6,5,4,3]]
Output: 3
Note:
`1 <= R, C <= 100`
`0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum score of a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a matrix, we need to determine the path which has the highest minimum value among all the values in that path. This problem can effectively be solved using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm or Binary Search with Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Thought Process

1. **Understanding Path Score**: The score of a path is defined as the minimum value along that path. Therefore, our goal is to maximize this minimum value.

2. **Binary Search**: Since the values in the matrix can range from 0 to \(10^9\), we can use binary search to efficiently find the maximum score. The idea here is to search for the possible scores between 0 and \(10^9\).

3. **Feasibility Check (BFS)**: For each potential score \(x\) during the binary search, we need to determine if there exists a valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the matrix where all values along the path are greater than or equal to \(x\). This can be checked using BFS or DFS.

### Implementation

Here's the Python solution using the above approach:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maximumMinimumPath(self, A: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        R, C = len(A), len(A[0])
        
        # Directions for moving in the matrix (up, down, left, right)
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        # BFS function to check if a path exists with minimum value >= mid
        def canReachPath(mid):
            if A[0][0] < mid or A[R-1][C-1] < mid:
                return False
            
            visited = [[False] * C for _ in range(R)]
            queue = deque([(0, 0)])
            visited[0][0] = True
            
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                if (x, y) == (R-1, C-1):
                    return True
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < R and 0 <= ny < C and not visited[nx][ny] and A[nx][ny] >= mid:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
            
            return False
        
        # Binary search for the maximum minimum value
        left, right = 0, 10**9
        answer = 0
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if canReachPath(mid):
                answer = mid  # mid is valid; try for a larger value
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
                
        return answer

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes a matrix `A` as input.

2. **Initialization**: We compute the dimensions of the matrix `R` (rows) and `C` (columns). We set up the possible movements in the matrix and define our BFS function.

3. **BFS Function**: The BFS checks if we can reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner with all values greater than or equal to `mid`. It keeps track of visited cells to avoid cycles.

4. **Binary Search**: We use binary search on the range between 0 and \(10^9\) to find the maximum score. For each midpoint, we check if there exists a path that satisfies the constraints (i.e., all values on the path are \(\geq \text{mid}\)).

5. **Returning the Result**: The maximum valid score found is returned as the result of the function.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently narrows down the possible scores using binary search combined with BFS to validate paths, ensuring that the solution runs well within the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
Output: [[1,2,4]]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.

Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.

`to_delete.length <= 1000`
`to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of deleting nodes from a binary tree and returning the remaining trees, we will implement a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree. The main steps of the approach are:

1. **DFS Traversal**: We will traverse the tree and check whether each node needs to be deleted based on the `to_delete` set. If a node should be deleted, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that its children are handled correctly.
  
2. **Handling Deleted Nodes**: If a node is deleted, we check its left and right children. If those children are not marked as deleted, we add them to the resulting forest (the list of remaining trees). 

3. **Building the Forest**: We will use a list to collect the roots of the trees that remain after deletions.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list of roots of the remaining trees.

Here's the LeetCode solution format for the problem:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root: TreeNode, to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        to_delete_set = set(to_delete)  # Convert to a set for quicker access
        remaining_forest = []
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return None
            
            # Recursively delete nodes in the left and right subtrees
            node.left = dfs(node.left)
            node.right = dfs(node.right)
            
            # If current node needs to be deleted
            if node.val in to_delete_set:
                # If left child is not None and not in to_delete, add to remaining forest
                if node.left:
                    remaining_forest.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    remaining_forest.append(node.right)
                return None  # Return None to signify the current node is deleted
            
            return node  # Return the current node since we're keeping it
        
        # Start DFS from the root
        if dfs(root):
            remaining_forest.append(root)  # If root is not deleted, add it to the forest
        
        return remaining_forest

```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This class defines the nodes of the binary tree. Each node contains a value, a left child, and a right child.

2. **delNodes Function**:
   - We initialize the `to_delete_set` from the `to_delete` list for O(1) lookup times.
   - We create an empty list `remaining_forest` to store the roots of the remaining trees.
  
3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function takes a node as input, and if it's None, it returns None.
   - It recursively calls itself for both left and right children to continue checking for nodes to delete.
   - If the current node is in the `to_delete_set`, we check its children:
     - If the left child exists and is not deleted, we add it to the `remaining_forest`.
     - The same goes for the right child.
   - If the node is deleted, we return None to signify that it shouldn't be added to the forest.
   - If the node should not be deleted, we return the node itself.

4. **Final Step**: After calling `dfs` on the root, we check if the root itself was not deleted, and if so, add it to the `remaining_forest`.

This implementation effectively traverses the entire tree, handles the deletions and constructs the resulting forest in an efficient manner.

# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:
The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is `0`. if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d + 1`.

The lowest common ancestor of a set `S` of nodes, is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in `S` is in the subtree with root `A`.

Note: This question is the same as 865: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.

The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.

Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lowest common ancestor of the deepest leaves in a binary tree, we will utilize a depth-first search (DFS) strategy. The idea is to traverse the tree, keeping track of the depth of each node, and at the same time identifying the deepest nodes and their common ancestor:

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Depth Calculation**: As we traverse the tree, we will calculate the depth of each node.
2. **Tracking Deepest Leaves**: We will keep track of the deepest leaves we've encountered during the traversal.
3. **Common Ancestor Identification**: During the traversal, whenever we find a level of leaves that is deeper than any previously found, we update our lowest common ancestor.

We'll use a recursive DFS function that will return the current depth of the node and will also update the lowest common ancestor when necessary.

### Python Code
Here is the implementation following the LeetCode solution format.



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        self.lca = None   # Initialize lowest common ancestor
        max_depth = self._dfs(root, 0)   # Start DFS with the root and depth 0
        return self.lca   # Return the found lowest common ancestor
    
    def _dfs(self, node: TreeNode, depth: int) -> int:
        if not node:
            return depth  # If we reach a null node, we return the current depth
        
        # Perform DFS on left and right children
        left_depth = self._dfs(node.left, depth + 1)
        right_depth = self._dfs(node.right, depth + 1)
        
        # Check if we found a new max_depth
        if left_depth == right_depth:  # If both sides are equal, we have a candidate for LCA
            self.lca = node     # The current node could be the lca of deepest leaves
            return left_depth   # Return the depth (as both sides are equal)
        else:
            return max(left_depth, right_depth)  # Return the maximum of the two depths

# Example for testing the function can be added as below:
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     # Construct your TreeNode structure to test
#     root = TreeNode(3)
#     root.left = TreeNode(5)
#     root.right = TreeNode(1)
#     root.left.left = TreeNode(6)
#     root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
#     root.left.right.left = TreeNode(7)
#     root.left.right.right = TreeNode(4)
#     root.right.left = TreeNode(0)
#     root.right.right = TreeNode(8)
#
#     solution = Solution()
#     lca = solution.lcaDeepestLeaves(root)
#     print(lca.val)  # This should print 2 for the above example

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **TreeNode Class**: This class defines the structure for a tree node, including its value and pointers to its left and right children.
2. **Solution Class**: This contains the method `lcaDeepestLeaves`.
   - `lca`: A variable to store the lowest common ancestor found during the traversal.
   - `max_depth`: We don't explicitly store it, but we use the recursive return value to compare depths.
3. **DFS Method**: 
   - **Base Condition**: If the node is null, we return the current depth.
   - We recursively obtain depths from left and right children.
   - If both depths are equal, it implies that we are at a common ancestor of the deepest leaves, and we update our `lca`.
   - We return the maximum of the left and right depths for the parent nodes.
   
By following the above steps, this solution effectively finds the lowest common ancestor of the deepest leaves in linear time O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

# 1136. Parallel Courses

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer `n` which indicates that we have `n` courses, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [a, b]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `a` and course `b`: course `a` has to be studied before course `b`.

In one semester, you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses. If there is no way to study all the courses, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: In the first semester, courses 1 and 2 are studied. In the second semester, course 3 is studied.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No course can be studied because they depend on each other.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 5000`
`1 <= relations.length <= 5000`
`1 <= a, b <= n`
`a != b`
All the pairs `[a, b]` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of semesters needed to complete all courses given the prerequistes, we can model this scenario as a graph and specifically utilize concepts from topological sorting. We treat each course as a node and each prerequisite relationship as a directed edge from course `a` (the prerequisite) to course `b` (the dependent course).

### Key Concepts:

1. **Graph Representation**: We can represent the courses and their relationships using an adjacency list. Each course will point to the courses that depend on it.

2. **In-Degree Array**: This is used to keep track of how many prerequisites each course has. If a course has an in-degree of zero, it means it can be taken in the current semester.

3. **Topological Sort**: We will perform a modified version of Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting using a queue to determine the order of course completion and count the semesters required.

4. **Cycle Detection**: If we can't complete all courses (i.e., if there are still courses left with prerequisites after processing), that means there is a cycle in the graph, which means it's impossible to complete all courses.

### Implementation Steps:

1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph and an in-degree list for the courses.
2. Initialize a queue and count the number of courses that can be taken in the first semester (those with an in-degree of zero).
3. Process courses in the queue, decrementing the in-degree of their dependent courses and adding new courses to the queue when their in-degree becomes zero.
4. Count the number of semesters until all courses have been processed.
5. If all courses can be processed, return the semester count; otherwise, return -1.

Here's how the implementation looks in a format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumSemesters(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)  # in-degree for courses 1 to n
        
        # Fill the graph and in-degree list
        for a, b in relations:
            graph[a].append(b)
            in_degree[b] += 1
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the queue and the count for semesters
        queue = deque()
        # Step 3: Add all courses with no prerequisites to the queue
        for course in range(1, n + 1):
            if in_degree[course] == 0:
                queue.append(course)

        semesters = 0  # Number of semesters required
        courses_taken = 0  # Count of courses taken
        
        # Step 4: Process the courses in the queue
        while queue:
            # At this point, we have a set of courses we can take
            size = len(queue)
            for _ in range(size):
                current_course = queue.popleft()
                courses_taken += 1  # Taking this course
                
                # Reduce the in-degree of dependent courses
                for neighbor in graph[current_course]:
                    in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
                    # If in-degree becomes 0, add to the queue
                    if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            
            semesters += 1  # Increment the semester count after taking courses
        
        # Step 5: Check if all courses have been taken
        return semesters if courses_taken == n else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We start by initializing the graph and in-degree tracking structures.
- We populate the graph based on the relations defined in the input.
- We then find all starting courses (in-degree 0) and place them in a queue.
- Using a loop, we process the courses semester by semester until the queue is empty.
- In each semester iteration, we process all courses available to be taken (those in the queue). After processing, we reduce the in-degree of each dependent course and add any that become available to the queue.
- Finally, we check if we have taken all courses. If yes, we return the number of semesters; if no, we return -1 indicating that not all courses can be completed due to cyclic dependencies. 

This approach is efficient, running in O(n + m) time where n is the number of courses and m is the number of relations, making it suitable for the input limits specified.

# 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game

### Problem Description 
Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the `root` of this binary tree, and the number of nodes `n` in the tree.  `n` is odd, and each node has a distinct value from `1` to `n`.

Initially, the first player names a value `x` with `1 <= x <= n`, and the second player names a value `y` with `1 <= y <= n` and `y != x`.  The first player colors the node with value `x` red, and the second player colors the node with value `y` blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a `y` to ensure you win the game, return `true`.  If it is not possible, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.


Constraints:
`root` is the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes and distinct node values from `1` to `n`.

`n` is odd.

`1 <= x <= n <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether the second player can guarantee a win in the turn-based game on a binary tree, we will follow several steps. Let's break down the process and write the code in a format suitable for submission to LeetCode.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Understand the Game Setup**: The game allows the first player to select a node and color it red. The second player must respond by selecting a different node to color it blue. Each player can color adjacent uncolored nodes on their respective turns.

2. **Identify the Winning Condition**: The second player wins if they can color more nodes than the first player by the end of the game. Since `n` is odd, if both players color nodes optimally, the player who has the opportunity to color more starting nodes wins.

3. **Tree Traversal**: We will traverse the binary tree to count the total number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the node chosen by the first player (`x`). This is done using a Depth-First Search (DFS).

4. **Determine Possible Outcomes**: After counting nodes, we compare the counts of the remaining nodes left for the second player. If the nodes colored by the second player (after choosing optimally) can exceed half of the total by taking advantage of the leftover nodes, the second player can ensure a win.

5. **Implementation**: Finally, the Python function will be defined that does the above analysis based on the given binary tree.

### Python Code:



```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def btreeGameWinningMove(self, root: TreeNode, n: int, x: int) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Count the size of left and right subtree of node `x`.
        def count_nodes(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            return 1 + count_nodes(node.left) + count_nodes(node.right)

        # Step 2: Find the node `x`
        def find_node_and_count(node):
            if not node:
                return None, 0
            if node.val == x:
                left_subtree_count = count_nodes(node.left)
                right_subtree_count = count_nodes(node.right)
                return node, (left_subtree_count, right_subtree_count)
            left_result = find_node_and_count(node.left)
            if left_result[0]:
                return left_result
            right_result = find_node_and_count(node.right)
            return right_result

        # Step 3: Fetch the subtree size counts and the total count
        x_node, (left_count, right_count) = find_node_and_count(root)
        
        # Total nodes colored by player 1 = 1 (x) + left_count + right_count
        player1_count = 1 + left_count + right_count
        
        # Remaining nodes are `n - player1_count`
        player2_count = n - player1_count
        
        # Step 4: The second player can win if they can color strictly more than half
        # Since n is odd, player1_count + player2_count = n, player2_count needs to be greater than (n // 2)
        if left_count > n // 2 or right_count > n // 2 or player2_count > n // 2:
            return True
        
        return False

```

### Explanation:
- We define a class `TreeNode` to represent nodes in the binary tree.
- The primary function `btreeGameWinningMove` is implemented within the `Solution` class. It first counts the nodes in the left and right subtree of the specified node `x`.
- Second, we check the remaining nodes available for the second player and determine if they can get more than half by leveraging the sizes of the two subtree counts and the uncolored nodes.
- The strategy effectively allows the second player to respond optimally to the first player's moves, ensuring that they have a winning strategy whenever possible.

This complete implementation should run directly on the LeetCode platform, respecting both the problem constraints and structure!

# 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

### Problem Description 
There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^5`
`n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
`connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
There are no repeated connections.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding critical connections in a network of servers, we can use Tarjan's Algorithm, which is designed to find bridges in a graph. A bridge is an edge which, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph, thus making it a critical connection.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the solution:

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Representation**: We'll represent the server connections using an adjacency list. Each server will have a list of other servers connected to it.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We'll perform a DFS to explore the graph. During the traversal, we'll maintain two arrays:
    - `disc[]`: To store the discovery times of visited vertices.
    - `low[]`: To store the lowest discovery time reachable from the subtree rooted with that vertex.

3. **Bridge Condition**: For every edge (u, v):
   - If `low[v] > disc[u]`, then (u, v) is a critical connection (or bridge) because the only way to reach `v` is through `u`, so removing this edge will disconnect `v` from the rest of the graph.

4. **Visited Tracking**: A visited list will be used to keep track of which servers have already been explored to avoid cycles.

5. **Return the Results**: Finally, we will return a list of the edges that are considered critical connections.

### Code Implementation:

Here is the full Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Create graph from connections
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in connections:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        # To store the discovery times of visited vertices
        disc = [-1] * n
        # To store the lowest points reachable
        low = [-1] * n
        # To store the result bridges
        bridges = []
        # To keep track of the parent vertices in the DFS tree
        parent = [-1] * n
        
        # Time variable to keep track of discovery times
        time = [0]  # Using a list so it's mutable
        
        def dfs(u):
            nonlocal graph, disc, low, bridges, parent, time
            
            # Initialize discovery time and low value
            disc[u] = low[u] = time[0]
            time[0] += 1
            
            # Explore adjacent vertices
            for v in graph[u]:
                if disc[v] == -1:  # If v is not visited
                    parent[v] = u
                    dfs(v)
                    
                    # Check if the subtree rooted at v has a connection back to one of the ancestors of u
                    low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                    # If the lowest vertex reachable from subtree under v is 
                    # below u in the DFS tree, then u-v is a bridge
                    if low[v] > disc[u]:
                        bridges.append([u, v])
                elif v != parent[u]:  # Update low value of u for parent function calls
                    low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

        # Start DFS from the first node
        for i in range(n):
            if disc[i] == -1:
                dfs(i)
        
        return bridges

```

### Steps to Run on LeetCode:

1. Import relevant libraries and define the `Solution` class.

3. Use the provided graph representation and traversal logic.
4. Return the list of critical connections.

This solution performs efficiently within the constraints provided, with a time complexity of O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (servers) and E is the number of edges (connections). It is designed to handle the maximum constraints of the problem.

# 1203. Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies

### Problem Description 
There are `n` items each belonging to zero or one of `m` groups where `group[i]` is the group that the `i`-th item belongs to and it's equal to `-1` if the `i`-th item belongs to no group. The items and the groups are zero indexed. A group can have no item belonging to it.

Return a sorted list of the items such that:
The items that belong to the same group are next to each other in the sorted list.

There are some relations between these items where `beforeItems[i]` is a list containing all the items that should come before the `i`-th item in the sorted array (to the left of the `i`-th item).

Return any solution if there is more than one solution and return an empty list if there is no solution.


Example 1:
Input: n = 8, m = 2, group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3,6],[],[],[]]
Output: [6,3,4,1,5,2,0,7]

Example 2:
Input: n = 8, m = 2, group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3],[],[4],[]]
Output: []
Explanation: This is the same as example 1 except that 4 needs to be before 6 in the sorted list.


Constraints:
`1 <= m <= n <= 3 * 104`
`group.length == beforeItems.length == n`
`-1 <= group[i] <= m - 1`
`0 <= beforeItems[i].length <= n - 1`
`0 <= beforeItems[i][j] <= n - 1`
`i != beforeItems[i][j]`
`beforeItems[i] `does not contain duplicates elements.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of sorting items based on their groups and given ordering constraints, we will approach it step by step. We will follow these actions to reach the solution:

1. **Group Items**: First, we will collect the items belonging to each group.
2. **Topological Sort**: Next, we will build a directed graph based on the `beforeItems` relationships and perform a topological sort for each group.
3. **Combine Results**: Finally, we will concatenate the sorted groups' results while ensuring that items within the same group are next to each other.

The detailed solution uses Kahn's Algorithm for topological sorting, which is effective in determining the order of the items while respecting the constraints given in `beforeItems`. 

Here's the implementation of the solution according to the LeetCode format:



```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def sortItems(self, n: int, m: int, group: List[int], beforeItems: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Assign new group IDs for items without a group
        group_id = max(group) + 1  # New group ID for items without groups
        for i in range(n):
            if group[i] == -1:
                group[i] = group_id
                group_id += 1
        
        # Step 2: Create graph for items and groups
        item_graph = defaultdict(list)
        group_graph = defaultdict(list)
        item_indegree = [0] * n
        group_indegree = [0] * (group_id)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for before in beforeItems[i]:
                item_graph[before].append(i)
                item_indegree[i] += 1
                
                if group[i] != group[before]:
                    group_graph[group[before]].append(group[i])
                    group_indegree[group[i]] += 1
        
        # Step 3: Topological Sort for items
        item_order = []
        item_queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if item_indegree[i] == 0])
        
        while item_queue:
            curr_item = item_queue.popleft()
            item_order.append(curr_item)
            for neighbor in item_graph[curr_item]:
                item_indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if item_indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    item_queue.append(neighbor)
        
        if len(item_order) != n:  # If there is a cycle
            return []
        
        # Step 4: Topological Sort for groups
        group_order = []
        group_queue = deque([g for g in range(group_id) if group_indegree[g] == 0])
        
        while group_queue:
            curr_group = group_queue.popleft()
            group_order.append(curr_group)
            for neighbor in group_graph[curr_group]:
                group_indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if group_indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    group_queue.append(neighbor)
        
        if len(group_order) != len(set(group)):  # If there is a cycle in groups
            return []
        
        # Step 5: Sort items within each group and heaping them in order
        group_to_items = defaultdict(list)
        for item in item_order:
            group_to_items[group[item]].append(item)
        
        result = []
        for g in group_order:
            result.extend(group_to_items[g])
        
        return result

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.sortItems(8, 2, [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], [[],[6],[5],[6],[3,6],[],[],[]]))
# print(sol.sortItems(8, 2, [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], [[],[6],[5],[6],[3],[],[4],[]]))

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Group Assignment**: The first part assigns new group IDs to items that don’t belong to any group, ensuring every item has a valid group.
2. **Graph Preparation**: Two graphs (for items and groups) are constructed to track dependencies, alongside in-degree counts to facilitate topological sorting.
3. **Topological Sorting**: We perform topological sorting for both items and groups. If we cannot sort all items or groups (indicating a cycle), we return an empty list.
4. **Result Construction**: Finally, we aggregate items from each group in the order determined by the group sorting.

This implementation adheres to the LeetCode problem format and will run properly on the site, providing the expected output while handling edge cases effectively.

# 1236. Web Crawler

### Problem Description 
Given a url `startUrl` and an interface `HtmlParser`, implement a web crawler to crawl all links that are under the same hostname as `startUrl`. 
Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.

Your crawler should:
Start from the page: `startUrl`
Call `HtmlParser.getUrls(url)` to get all urls from a webpage of given url.

Do not crawl the same link twice.

Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as `startUrl`.

As shown in the example url above, the hostname is `example.org`. For simplicity sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port specified. For example, the urls `http://leetcode.com/problems` and `http://leetcode.com/contest` are under the same hostname, while urls `http://example.org/test` and `http://example.com/abc` are not under the same hostname.

The `HtmlParser` interface is defined as such: 
interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.

  public List<String> getUrls(String url);
}
Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing purposes you'll have three variables urls`, edges` and startUrl`. Notice that you will only have access to startUrl` in your code, while urls` and edges` are not directly accessible to you in code.


Example 1:
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"
Output: [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]

Example 2:
Input: 
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"
]
edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
startUrl = "http://news.google.com"
Output: ["http://news.google.com"]
Explanation: The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.


Constraints:
`1 <= urls.length <= 1000`
`1 <= urls[i].length <= 300`
`startUrl` is one of the `urls`.

Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may contain only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits  from '0' to '9' and the hyphen-minus character ('-').

The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-'). 
See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames
You may assume there're no duplicates in url library.

### Solution 
 To solve the web crawler problem as specified, we will create a Python class that implements the crawling functionality using the provided `HtmlParser` interface. The fundamental approach involves the following steps:

1. **Extract the Hostname**: We need to extract the hostname from the given `startUrl` to ensure we only crawl URLs that share the same hostname.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We will employ a BFS approach to explore all reachable URLs starting from `startUrl`. This will allow us to traverse various links while maintaining a record of those we've already visited, preventing duplicate crawls.

3. **Filtering URLs**: While crawling, each URL will be filtered to ensure it belongs to the same hostname as `startUrl`.

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

### Implementation



```python
from collections import deque
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class Solution:
    def crawl(self, startUrl: str, htmlParser: 'HtmlParser') -> List[str]:
        # Extract the hostname from the startUrl
        parsed_url = urlparse(startUrl)
        hostname = parsed_url.hostname
        
        # Initialize a queue for BFS and a set to keep track of visited URLs
        queue = deque([startUrl])
        visited = set([startUrl])
        result = []

        while queue:
            # Get the next URL to process
            current_url = queue.popleft()
            result.append(current_url)
            
            # Get all URLs from the current webpage
            for url in htmlParser.getUrls(current_url):
                if url not in visited:
                    # Check if the URL's hostname matches the startUrl's hostname
                    if urlparse(url).hostname == hostname:
                        visited.add(url)
                        queue.append(url)

        return result

```

### Explanation:

1. **Extracting the Hostname**:
   - We utilize the `urlparse` function to break down the `startUrl` and easily access its hostname.

2. **Initialization**:
   - A deque (`queue`) is used for performing our BFS. We start by adding `startUrl` to this queue.
   - A set (`visited`) is initialized to keep track of URLs that we've already crawled to prevent revisiting them.
   - A list (`result`) is used to collect all URLs we visit during the crawl.

3. **BFS Loop**:
   - While there are URLs in the queue:
     - We dequeue an element (the current URL).
     - Add the current URL to the result list.
     - We call `htmlParser.getUrls(current_url)` to get all URLs linked from this page.
     
4. **Filtering URLs**:
   - For each URL retrieved, we check:
     - If it hasn't already been visited.
     - If it belongs to the same hostname as the `startUrl`.
   - If both checks pass, we add the URL to the `visited` set and enqueue it for further exploration.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, we return the `result` list which contains all the crawled URLs.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (URLs) and E is the number of edges (connections) as we potentially visit each URL and examine all its links.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for storing the visited set and the queue.

This implementation adheres to the constraints and requirements stated in the problem, and correctly formats the solution for direct use in the LeetCode environment.

# 1242. Web Crawler Multithreaded

### Problem Description 
Given a url `startUrl` and an interface `HtmlParser`, implement a Multi-threaded web crawler to crawl all links that are under the same hostname as `startUrl`. 
Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.

Your crawler should:
Start from the page: `startUrl`
Call `HtmlParser.getUrls(url)` to get all urls from a webpage of given url.

Do not crawl the same link twice.

Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as `startUrl`.

As shown in the example url above, the hostname is `example.org`. For simplicity sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port specified. For example, the urls `http://leetcode.com/problems` and `http://leetcode.com/contest` are under the same hostname, while urls `http://example.org/test` and `http://example.com/abc` are not under the same hostname.

The `HtmlParser` interface is defined as such: 
interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.

  // This is a blocking call, that means it will do HTTP request and return when this request is finished.

  public List<String> getUrls(String url);
}
Note that `getUrls(String url)` simulates performing a HTTP request. You can treat it as a blocking function call which waits for a HTTP request to finish. It is guaranteed that `getUrls(String url)` will return the urls within 15ms.  Single-threaded solutions will exceed the time limit so, can your multi-threaded web crawler do better?
Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing purposes you'll have three variables urls`, edges` and startUrl`. Notice that you will only have access to startUrl` in your code, while urls` and edges` are not directly accessible to you in code.

Follow up:
Assume we have 10,000 nodes and 1 billion URLs to crawl. We will deploy the same software onto each node. The software can know about all the nodes. We have to minimize communication between machines and make sure each node does equal amount of work. How would your web crawler design change?
What if one node fails or does not work?
How do you know when the crawler is done?

Example 1:
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"
Output: [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]

Example 2:
Input: 
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"
]
edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
startUrl = "http://news.google.com"
Output: ["http://news.google.com"]
Explanation: The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.


Constraints:
`1 <= urls.length <= 1000`
`1 <= urls[i].length <= 300`
`startUrl` is one of the `urls`.

Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may contain only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits from '0' to '9' and the hyphen-minus character ('-').

The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-'). 
See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames
You may assume there're no duplicates in url library.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of building a multi-threaded web crawler that collects URLs under the same hostname from a given start URL using the `HtmlParser` interface, we can follow these steps:

### Explanation

1. **Extract the Hostname**: 
   We first need to parse the `startUrl` to get its hostname. This can be done using Python's `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module.

2. **Set up Data Structures**:
   We will use a set to keep track of crawled URLs to prevent duplicates. Additionally, we can use a queue to manage URLs that need to be crawled.

3. **Threading**:
   Since the crawler needs to be multi-threaded, we can use Python's `threading` library. We will create a pool of threads that will crawl URLs concurrently.

4. **Crawling Logic**:
   Each thread will take a URL from the queue, call `HtmlParser.getUrls(url)` to get new URLs, and if they belong to the same hostname and haven't been crawled yet, they will be added to the queue and the set.

5. **Joining Threads**:
   We need to wait for all threads to finish their work before returning the crawled URLs.

6. **Function Signature**:
   We will implement the `crawl` function following LeetCode's expectations, which takes `startUrl` as input and utilizes the `HtmlParser` instance to perform the crawling.

### Python Code

Here is how the above logic can be implemented in Python:



```python
from threading import Thread, Lock
from queue import Queue
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import time

class HtmlParser:
    def getUrls(self, url: str):
        # Simulated method; to be provided by the environment.
        pass

class Solution:
    def crawl(self, startUrl: str, htmlParser: HtmlParser):
        # Parse the hostname from the startUrl
        hostname = urlparse(startUrl).hostname
        
        # Data structures for crawling
        crawled = set()
        url_queue = Queue()
        url_queue.put(startUrl)
        crawled.add(startUrl)
        
        # Lock to synchronize output (if necessary)
        lock = Lock()
        
        def crawl_urls():
            while not url_queue.empty():
                url = url_queue.get()
                # Fetch URLs from the current page
                for new_url in htmlParser.getUrls(url):
                    # Check if the URL is from the same hostname and not crawled yet
                    if new_url not in crawled and urlparse(new_url).hostname == hostname:
                        with lock:
                            crawled.add(new_url)
                        url_queue.put(new_url)
                url_queue.task_done()
        
        # Create thread pool
        threads = []
        for _ in range(5):  # Number of threads
            thread = Thread(target=crawl_urls)
            threads.append(thread)
            thread.start()
        
        # Wait for all threads to finish
        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()
        
        # Return the crawled URLs as a list
        return list(crawled)

# Note: When running the code in the LeetCode environment, HtmlParser and its methods will be provided.

```

### Implementation Details

- **Hostname Extraction**: We used `urlparse` to get the hostname from the `startUrl`.
- **Queue for URLs**: A queue is used to facilitate thread-safe URL management, allowing multiple threads to fetch URLs for crawling.
- **Multi-threading**: We create a fixed number of threads (5 in this case), which can be adjusted based on performance metrics.
- **Synchronization Using Lock**: Although Python's `set()` is thread-safe, we use a lock when modifying shared data structures to avoid potential race conditions.

### Follow-up Questions (Design Considerations)

1. **Minimizing Communication Across Nodes**: Each node could have a portion of URLs assigned to it beforehand. This way, communication overhead between nodes would be minimized, with each node working on its own subsection.
  
2. **Handling Node Failures**: Implement retries for failed nodes, allowing others to take over the workload. Monitoring systems could detect failures and redistribute tasks dynamically.

3. **Crawling Completion**: Each node can signal completion using a shared system (like a distributed database or message queue) that tracks the URLs processed. Once all nodes confirm completion, the crawlers can terminate.

The above implementation can be directly run in the LeetCode environment given that the `HtmlParser` interface is provided as specified.

# 1245. Tree Diameter

### Problem Description 
Given an undirected tree, return its diameter: the number of edges in a longest path in that tree.

The tree is given as an array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v]` is a bidirectional edge between nodes `u` and `v`.  Each node has labels in the set `{0, 1, ..., edges.length}`.


Example 1:
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
A longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.


Example 2:
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
A longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.


Constraints:
`0 <= edges.length < 10^4`
`edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]`
`0 <= edges[i][j] <= edges.length`
The given edges form an undirected tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the diameter of an undirected tree defined by edges, we can use a Depth First Search (DFS) approach. The diameter of a tree can be found using the following steps:

1. **Build the Graph**: Represent the tree structure as an adjacency list from the given edge pairs.
2. **Perform DFS**: Start from any arbitrary node and use DFS to find the farthest node from this starting node. 
3. **Second DFS**: Use the farthest node found in the previous step as the new starting node, and perform another DFS to determine the longest distance to any other node in the tree. This distance is the diameter of the tree.

### Python Code Implementation

Here's the complete Python code following the LeetCode format:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def treeDiameter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Build the adjacency list representation of the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # Step 2: Function to perform DFS and return the farthest node and its distance
        def dfs(node: int, parent: int) -> (int, int):
            max_distance = 0
            farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:  # Avoid going back to the parent node
                    distance, target_node = dfs(neighbor, node)
                    distance += 1  # Add edge between current node and the neighbor
                    if distance > max_distance:  # Update max distance and farthest node
                        max_distance = distance
                        farthest_node = target_node
            
            return max_distance, farthest_node
        
        # Step 3: Perform the first DFS to find one endpoint of the longest path
        _, farthest_node_from_arbitrary = dfs(0, -1)  # Start from arbitrary node (0)
        
        # Step 4: Perform the second DFS from the farthest node found to get the diameter
        diameter, _ = dfs(farthest_node_from_arbitrary, -1)
        
        return diameter

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Imports and Class Definition**: We import the necessary modules and define the `Solution` class.
2. **Graph Representation**: We use a `defaultdict` to create an adjacency list `graph`, which stores each node's connections.
3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function explores the tree recursively:
   - It takes the current node and its parent node as arguments to avoid traversing back.
   - For each neighbor, we call the DFS recursively, accumulating the distances.
   - It returns the maximum distance found and the farthest node.
4. **Finding Diameter**:
   - We first invoke `dfs` starting from node `0` (or any arbitrary node) to find a farthest node.
   - Then, we invoke `dfs` again starting from this farthest node to find the maximum distance, which gives us the tree's diameter.
5. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the calculated diameter.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the tree, since we visit each node and each edge exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for storing the graph and for the recursive call stack.

This code can be directly run on the LeetCode platform to solve the problem accordingly.

# 1254. Number of Closed Islands

### Problem Description 
Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s` and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s.`
Return the number of closed islands.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
`1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100`
`0 <= grid[i][j] <=1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting closed islands in a grid of `0s` and `1s`, we will use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. A closed island is defined as a region of land (`0s`) completely surrounded by water (`1s`). 

The idea is to iterate over each cell in the grid and, whenever we encounter a `0`, we will use DFS to explore the entire island. As we do this, we will also check if any part of the island touches the edge of the grid. If it does touch the edge, then it cannot be a closed island. We will also keep track of the count of closed islands we find.

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of our approach:

1. **Initialize the Count**: Begin with a count of zero for closed islands.
  
2. **DFS Implementation**: Create a recursive function called `dfs` that will take the current coordinates and mark all connected land cells (`0s`) as visited by changing them to `1s`.

3. **Boundary and Edge Checking**: In the DFS function, check if the current cell is out of bounds or if it's water (`1`). If either condition is satisfied, return.

4. **Edge Touching Check**: If the DFS goes out of the grid boundaries at any point, then the island is not closed.

5. **Counting Closed Islands**: If we finish our DFS without touching the edge of the grid and we’ve visited land (`0s`), we found a closed island. We increment the count.

6. **Iterate the Grid**: Loop through each cell in the grid; if a `0` is found, trigger the DFS.

Here's the code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def closedIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0

        self.rows = len(grid)
        self.cols = len(grid[0])
        self.count = 0

        def dfs(x, y):
            # If we go out of bounds, we return True to indicate it touches the edge.
            if x < 0 or x >= self.rows or y < 0 or y >= self.cols:
                return False
            
            # If we encounter water, just return true as it's not the edge.
            if grid[x][y] == 1:
                return True
            
            # Mark the cell as visited
            grid[x][y] = 1
            
            # Check all four directions
            up = dfs(x - 1, y)
            down = dfs(x + 1, y)
            left = dfs(x, y - 1)
            right = dfs(x, y + 1)

            # The island is closed if all four directions return True
            return up and down and left and right

        # Loop through all cells in the grid
        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                # Start DFS if we find a closed island
                if grid[r][c] == 0:
                    if dfs(r, c):  # Only increment if it’s a closed island
                        self.count += 1
        
        return self.count

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:
- `closedIsland` method is the main driver function that interacts with the grid. 
- We check the validity of the grid and initialize dimensions and count.
- The `dfs` function handles the depth-first search; it alters grid values to prevent revisiting the same cell.
- We check for boundaries while exploring; if we return `False`, it indicates that the island is touching the edge of the grid.
- Inside our nested loops, when we find an unvisited land cell (`0`), we call `dfs`. If it returns `True`, indicating a closed island, we increment our count.
- Finally, we return the total count of closed islands.

With this approach, we efficiently traverse the grid, marking visited cells and counting closed islands without revisiting cells, ensuring the solution is optimal.

# 1273. Delete Tree Nodes

### Problem Description 
A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:
The number of nodes is `nodes`;
The value of the `i`-th node is `value[i]`;
The parent of the `i`-th node is `parent[i]`.

Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.


Example 1:
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-2]
Output: 6

Example 3:
Input: nodes = 5, parent = [-1,0,1,0,0], value = [-672,441,18,728,378]
Output: 5

Example 4:
Input: nodes = 5, parent = [-1,0,0,1,1], value = [-686,-842,616,-739,-746]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= nodes <= 10^4`
`parent.length == nodes`
`0 <= parent[i] <= nodes - 1`
`parent[0] == -1` which indicates that `0` is the root.

`value.length == nodes`
`-10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5`
The given input is guaranteed to represent a valid tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of removing subtrees from a tree whose nodes sum to zero, we can employ a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. Here's the detailed explanation followed by a complete solution in the LeetCode format.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a tree represented by an array of parent indices and a corresponding array of node values.
   - The aim is to traverse the tree and remove any subtrees whose total sum of node values is zero.
   - Finally, we need to count the number of remaining nodes.

2. **Tree Representation**:
   - The `parent` array allows us to understand the tree structure. Each index represents a node and its value is its parent.
   - We will build an adjacency list to represent the tree, which will be helpful for our DFS traversal.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - Using a recursive DFS function, we will compute the sum of values for each subtree.
   - If we find that the sum of any subtree is zero, we will return zero (indicating it should be removed).
   - If the sum is non-zero, we include it in our count of remaining nodes.

4. **Counting Remaining Nodes**:
   - We can maintain a counter to keep track of nodes that are not part of zero-sum subtrees.

### Implementation:

Below is the Python implementation in the format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countNodesAfterRemoval(self, nodes: int, parent: List[int], value: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Build the tree from parent relationships
        tree = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(nodes):
            if parent[i] != -1:  # Skip the root
                tree[parent[i]].append(i)
        
        # DFS function to compute subtree sums
        def dfs(node: int) -> int:
            total_sum = value[node]
            for child in tree[node]:
                child_sum = dfs(child)
                total_sum += child_sum
            
            # If total_sum is 0, we treat this node as having been removed
            return total_sum
        
        remaining_nodes = 0
        total_nodes = dfs(0)  # Start DFS from the root
        
        # Count remaining nodes by checking if the root itself is part of a zero-sum removal
        if total_nodes != 0:
            remaining_nodes += 1  # The root remains
            for child in tree[0]:  # Check children of root
                if dfs(child) != 0:
                    remaining_nodes += 1  # Count child subtrees that do not sum to zero
        
        return remaining_nodes

# This class can now be used on LeetCode directly.

```

# 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 19

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`1 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the sum of values of the deepest leaves in a binary tree, we can utilize a level-order traversal approach (also known as breadth-first search). This allows us to traverse the tree level by level and identify the deepest leaves efficiently. 

## Problem Breakdown
1. We will perform a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree.
2. At each level of the tree, we will keep track of the sum of the node values.
3. Once we complete the traversal, the last sum we recorded will represent the sum of the deepest leaves.

## Steps
1. Initialize a queue to facilitate level-order traversal.
2. Keep a variable to store the sum of the current level's node values.
3. Use a loop to process nodes level by level until all nodes are processed.
4. After processing all levels, the sum of the deepest leaves will be the last recorded sum.

## TreeNode Definition
The TreeNode class needs to be defined as follows for the LeetCode structure:



```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

```

## Python Code
Here's the code that implements the approach described:



```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def deepestLeavesSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        queue = deque([root])
        current_level_sum = 0
        
        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)
            current_level_sum = 0  # Reset sum for this level
            
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.popleft()
                current_level_sum += node.val
                
                # Add child nodes to the queue
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
        
        return current_level_sum

```

## Explanation of the Code
1. **TreeNode Definition**: A simple class that models a binary tree node with a constructor for value and left/right children.
2. **Solution Class**: Contains the method `deepestLeavesSum` which performs the main logic.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - A deque is initialized with the root node.
   - The outer loop processes each level of the tree.
   - The inner loop iterates over all nodes at the current level, calculates their sum, and enqueues their children.
   - The `current_level_sum` variable is updated during each level, ensuring that once the loop ends, it holds the value of the last processed level (deepest level).
4. **Returning Result**: Finally, we return `current_level_sum`, which contains the sum of the deepest leaves.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree, which determines the maximum size of the queue at any level.

This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.

# 1306. Jump Game III

### Problem Description 
Given an array of non-negative integers `arr`, you are initially positioned at `start` index of the array. When you are at index `i`, you can jump to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]`, check if you can reach to any index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: 
index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 

Example 2:
Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0
Output: true 
Explanation: 
One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is: 
index 0 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

Example 3:
Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104`
`0 <= arr[i] < arr.length`
`0 <= start < arr.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to determine if we can reach any index in the given array `arr` that contains the value `0`, starting from the given `start` index. We can reach an index from `i` by jumping either to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]`. Our approach will involve using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy to explore all reachable indices.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **BFS / Queue Initialization**: Use a queue to explore the reachable indices starting from the `start` index. Initialize the queue with the `start` index.

2. **Visited Set**: Maintain a set to keep track of visited indices to prevent re-processing the same index and create an infinite loop.

3. **Processing the Queue**:
   - Dequeue an index and check if it contains the value `0`. If yes, return `True`.
   - Calculate the indices for the two possible jumps: `i + arr[i]` and `i - arr[i]`.
   - If the jumped indices are valid (i.e., within bounds and not yet visited), add them to the queue and mark them as visited.

4. **Final Check**: If we exhaust the queue without finding a zero, return `False`.

The overall time complexity of this approach is O(n) in the worst case because each index could be processed once.

### Implementation in Python

Below is the implementation formatted according to LeetCode standards:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def canReach(self, arr: List[int], start: int) -> bool:
        # Initialize the queue and a set for visited nodes
        queue = deque([start])
        visited = set([start])
        
        while queue:
            # Dequeue an index to process
            index = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if the current index has value 0
            if arr[index] == 0:
                return True
            
            # Calculate the two new indices to jump to
            jump_forward = index + arr[index]
            jump_backward = index - arr[index]
            
            # If jump forward is within bounds and not yet visited, enqueue it
            if 0 <= jump_forward < len(arr) and jump_forward not in visited:
                visited.add(jump_forward)
                queue.append(jump_forward)
            
            # If jump backward is within bounds and not yet visited, enqueue it
            if 0 <= jump_backward < len(arr) and jump_backward not in visited:
                visited.add(jump_backward)
                queue.append(jump_backward)
        
        # If we exhausted all options and didn't find a zero
        return False

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by importing the `deque` from the `collections` module, which allows for efficient popping from the front of the queue.
- The `canReach` method defines the main logic. It initializes a queue with the starting index and a visited set to track which indices have been processed.
- We enter a loop that continues until the queue is empty. For each index processed, we check if the value at that index is zero.
- We then calculate the potential jump indices. If these indices are valid and have not been visited, we add them to the queue and mark them as visited.
- If the loop finishes without finding a zero, we return `False`.

This solution is efficient and aligns well with the problem constraints, ensuring it runs in a reasonable time frame for the input limits provided.

# 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)
If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return `0`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `10^4`.

The value of nodes is between `1` and `100`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of summing the values of nodes with even-valued grandparents in a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach to traverse the tree. Here’s a structured solution in the format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sumEvenGrandparent(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # Helper function for DFS traversal
        def dfs(node, parent_val, grandparent_val):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            sum_val = 0
            
            # Check if the grandparent's value is even
            if grandparent_val % 2 == 0:
                sum_val += node.val
            
            # Recursively calculate the sum for left and right subtrees
            sum_val += dfs(node.left, node.val, parent_val)
            sum_val += dfs(node.right, node.val, parent_val)
            
            return sum_val
        
        # Start DFS with initial parent and grandparent values as 0
        return dfs(root, 0, 0)


```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class**: 
   - A simple class representing a node in a binary tree. It has `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.

2. **Solution Class**: 
   - This class contains the main method `sumEvenGrandparent`.

3. **sumEvenGrandparent Method**:
   - This method initializes the depth-first search (DFS) by calling the inner function `dfs`, passing the root of the tree and initial values for the parent and grandparent, which are both set to `0`.

4. **dfs Function**:
   - **Parameters**: The `dfs` function takes three parameters: 
     - `node`: the current node being processed,
     - `parent_val`: the value of the parent of the current node,
     - `grandparent_val`: the value of the grandparent of the current node.
   - **Base Case**: If the `node` is `None`, it returns `0`, indicating no contribution to the sum from this path.
   - **Sum Calculation**: It checks if `grandparent_val` is even. If so, it adds the value of the current node (`node.val`) to `sum_val`.
   - **Recursive Calls**: The function makes recursive calls to the left and right children of the current node while updating the parent and grandparent values.
   - Finally, it returns the computed `sum_val`.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The main method returns the result of the `dfs` function starting with the root node.

### Efficiency:
- The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.
- The space complexity is O(H) due to the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this can be O(N).

You can run this code directly on LeetCode after defining your tree structure using `TreeNode` instances. The provided code will efficiently compute the required sum based on the problem statement.

# 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected

### Problem Description 
There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between computers `a` and `b`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

Given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected. Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it's not possible, return -1. 

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.


Example 2:
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough cables.


Example 4:
Input: n = 5, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^5`
`1 <= connections.length <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)`
`connections[i].length == 2`
`0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] < n`
`connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
There are no repeated connections.

No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of connecting all computers in a network with a minimum number of cable reconnections, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements**: We need to make sure that all the computers become connected. To do this, we can think of the computers as nodes in a graph, and the connections as edges. A fully connected graph with `n` nodes requires exactly `n-1` edges.

2. **Analyze the Input**:
   - If the number of connections is less than `n-1`, it’s impossible to connect all computers, so we return -1.
   - Otherwise, we need to determine how many disconnected components (groups of computers that are directly or indirectly connected) exist in the graph.

3. **Counting Components**: We can use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to explore the graph and count the number of connected components.

4. **Calculate the Minimum Moves**: Once we know the number of disconnected components, let’s say `k`, we need at least `k-1` reconnections to make all components connected because each additional connection can reduce the number of components by one.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, the result is either `k-1` if it’s possible to connect all computers or -1 if the connections provided are insufficient.

Here's the Python code implementing the above logic, formatted for submission on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def makeConnected(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(connections) < n - 1:
            return -1
        
        # Create an adjacency list for the graph
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for a, b in connections:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)

        # A function to perform DFS
        def dfs(node: int):
            stack = [node]
            while stack:
                current = stack.pop()
                for neighbor in adj[current]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        stack.append(neighbor)

        visited = set()
        components = 0
        
        # Count connected components using DFS
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                components += 1
                visited.add(i)
                dfs(i)

        # Minimum number of moves necessary to connect all components
        return components - 1

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Check**: 
   - The first condition checks if the number of connections is less than `n-1`. If true, it returns -1 immediately since we can't connect all computers.

2. **Adjacency List**:
   - An adjacency list `adj` is created where `adj[i]` contains a list of all computers directly connected to computer `i`.

3. **DFS Implementation**:
   - We define a `dfs` function that visits all reachable computers from a starting computer. It uses an iterative approach with a stack to avoid recursion stack overflow for large inputs.

4. **Component Counting**:
   - A loop iterates through all computers. If a computer hasn't been visited, it indicates the start of a new component, and we perform a DFS from that computer to mark all connected computers.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The number of connected components is counted, and since we need `components - 1` reconnections to connect them all, we return that value.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of cable reconnections required, and it runs in O(n + m) time complexity, where `n` is the number of computers and `m` is the number of connections, making it suitable for the input limits provided.

# 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree `root`. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
Explanation:  Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)

Example 3:
Input: root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
Output: 1025

Example 4:
Input: root = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
Each tree has at most `50000` nodes and at least `2` nodes.

Each node's value is between `[1, 10000]`.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of maximizing the product of the sums of two subtrees obtained by removing one edge from a binary tree, we can follow these steps:

### Explanation
1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: 
   - A binary tree has nodes containing values. When we cut an edge (removing a connection between a parent and a child), we essentially break the tree into two separate trees.

2. **Calculating Tree Sums**: 
   - First, we need to compute the total sum of all nodes in the tree. This helps in determining the sum of one of the trees once we cut an edge.

3. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - We can perform a depth-first traversal of the tree to calculate the sum of each subtree rooted at each node.
   - During this traversal, we will simultaneously compute the product of the sum of the subtree formed by the current node and the remainder of the tree (total sum - subtree sum). The product will only be computed when we are not at the root since cutting the edge is only allowed when it's not the full tree.

4. **Maintaining Maximum Product**: 
   - We will maintain a variable to store the maximum product found during the traversal.

5. **Modulo Operation**: 
   - Since the result can be very large, we will return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Implementation in Python
Here's how we can implement the algorithm in Python to run on LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

MOD = 10**9 + 7

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # Step 1: Calculate the total sum of the tree
        self.total_sum = self.calculate_total_sum(root)
        self.max_product = 0
        
        # Step 2: Find maximum product of the sums of the subtrees
        self.calculate_max_product(root)
        
        return self.max_product % MOD
    
    def calculate_total_sum(self, node: TreeNode) -> int:
        """This function will return the total sum of the tree."""
        if not node:
            return 0
        return node.val + self.calculate_total_sum(node.left) + self.calculate_total_sum(node.right)
    
    def calculate_max_product(self, node: TreeNode) -> int:
        """This function will calculate the maximum product possible."""
        if not node:
            return 0
        
        left_sum = self.calculate_max_product(node.left)
        right_sum = self.calculate_max_product(node.right)
        
        # Calculate current subtree sum
        current_sum = node.val + left_sum + right_sum
        
        # Only compute product if it's not the root (if we cut this edge)
        if left_sum > 0:  # Only consider if left subtree exists
            product1 = left_sum * (self.total_sum - left_sum)
            self.max_product = max(self.max_product, product1)
        if right_sum > 0:  # Only consider if right subtree exists
            product2 = right_sum * (self.total_sum - right_sum)
            self.max_product = max(self.max_product, product2)
        
        return current_sum

```

### Explanation of the Code
- **TreeNode class**: Defines the structure of a binary tree node with `val`, `left`, and `right`.
- **Solution class**: Contains methods to solve the problem.
  - `maxProduct`: This method initializes the required total sum and maximum product variables, then calls the helper function to compute the product.
  - `calculate_total_sum`: A recursive function to compute the total sum of tree nodes.
  - `calculate_max_product`: A recursive function that computes the sums of subtrees, determines their products when edges are cut, and keeps track of the maximum product encountered.

**Time Complexity**: The solution runs in \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes because each node is visited once.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

Now, this code can be directly run on the LeetCode platform, and it should work correctly for the problem described.

# 1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees

### Problem Description 
A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company is the one with `headID`.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the `manager` array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, headID = 0, manager = [-1], informTime = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: The head of the company is the only employee in the company.


Example 2:
Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.

The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown.


Example 3:
Input: n = 7, headID = 6, manager = [1,2,3,4,5,6,-1], informTime = [0,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 21
Explanation: The head has id = 6. He will inform employee with id = 5 in 1 minute.

The employee with id = 5 will inform the employee with id = 4 in 2 minutes.

The employee with id = 4 will inform the employee with id = 3 in 3 minutes.

The employee with id = 3 will inform the employee with id = 2 in 4 minutes.

The employee with id = 2 will inform the employee with id = 1 in 5 minutes.

The employee with id = 1 will inform the employee with id = 0 in 6 minutes.

Needed time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.


Example 4:
Input: n = 15, headID = 0, manager = [-1,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6], informTime = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first minute the head will inform employees 1 and 2.

The second minute they will inform employees 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The third minute they will inform the rest of employees.


Example 5:
Input: n = 4, headID = 2, manager = [3,3,-1,2], informTime = [0,0,162,914]
Output: 1076

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 105`
`0 <= headID < n`
`manager.length == n`
`0 <= manager[i] < n`
`manager[headID] == -1`
`informTime.length == n`
`0 <= informTime[i] <= 1000`
`informTime[i] == 0` if employee `i` has no subordinates.

It is guaranteed that all the employees can be informed.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the total time taken to inform all employees in a company hierarchy, we can treat the problem as a tree traversal task. Each employee can be represented as a node in the tree, where each node has directed edges to its subordinates. The goal is to calculate the total time it takes for the head of the company (the root of the tree) to inform all employees, taking into account the time each employee takes to inform their subordinates.

### Approach

1. **Building the Tree Structure**: We need to create an adjacency list representation of the organization based on the `manager` input array, where each employee points to their direct subordinates.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Starting from the `headID`, we will perform a DFS to propagate the inform time down the hierarchy. As we traverse the tree, we will sum up the inform times, accounting for the time taken by each employee to inform their respective subordinates.

### Steps
- Parse the input data to build an adjacency list for the employee hierarchy.
- Define a recursive DFS function to calculate the maximum time taken to inform all subordinates for each employee.
- Start the DFS from the `headID` and return the total time.

### Python Solution

Here’s the Python code that implements the above approach:



```python
def numOfMinutes(n: int, headID: int, manager: list[int], informTime: list[int]) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Build the tree using an adjacency list
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for employee in range(n):
        if manager[employee] != -1:  # Ignore the head of the company
            tree[manager[employee]].append(employee)
    
    # Step 2: Define a DFS function to compute the total inform time
    def dfs(employee: int) -> int:
        # Base case: If the employee has no subordinates
        if employee not in tree:
            return 0
        
        max_time = 0
        # Visit all subordinates and get the max inform time
        for subordinate in tree[employee]:
            time_taken = dfs(subordinate)  # recursive call to inform this subordinate
            max_time = max(max_time, time_taken)
        
        return informTime[employee] + max_time  # add current employee's inform time
    
    # Start DFS from the head of the company
    return dfs(headID)

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Tree Construction**: 
   - We create a `defaultdict` of lists called `tree` to store which employees report to which managers. This is built by iterating through the `manager` list.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function takes an `employee` as input and checks if they have any subordinates.
   - If they have no subordinates (not in `tree`), it returns 0.
   - For each subordinate, we recursively call `dfs` and track the maximum time taken to inform their subordinates.
   - Finally, we return the time taken for the current employee plus the maximum time for all their subordinates.

3. **Execution**:
   - We call `dfs` with `headID` to initiate the process and return the total time required to inform all employees.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the total time required while respecting the constraints, effectively managing the depth and breadth of the employee hierarchy. The time complexity is O(n) due to the traversal of each employee once. 

This solution is directly runnable on the LeetCode platform with the provided format.

# 1377. Frog Position After T Seconds

### Problem Description 
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`. A frog starts jumping from vertex 1. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another unvisited vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`.

Return the probability that after `t` seconds the frog is on the vertex `target`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4
Output: 0.16666666666666666 
Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666. 

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7
Output: 0.3333333333333333
Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 = 0.3333333333333333 probability to the vertex 7 after second 1. 

Example 3:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 20, target = 6
Output: 0.16666666666666666

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 100`
`edges.length == n - 1`
`edges[i].length == 2`
`1 <= ai, bi <= n`
`1 <= t <= 50`
`1 <= target <= n`
Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the probability that a frog is on a specific target vertex after a given number of seconds in an undirected tree, we can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization. Here's a structured breakdown and implementation:

### Approach

1. **Graph Representation**: The tree can be represented using an adjacency list, built from the given edges. Each node will have a list of its directly connected (neighboring) nodes.

2. **DFS Function**: We will define a recursive function `dfs(node, time_remaining)` where:
   - `node`: the current vertex of the frog.
   - `time_remaining`: how many seconds the frog can still jump.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If `time_remaining` is 0, check if the current node is the target. If yes, return a probability of 1 (since we are at the target), otherwise return 0.
   - If the frog is at a node with no remaining time and it isn't the target, it stays in place.

4. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - When jumping, calculate the number of unvisited neighbors the frog can jump to.
   - If there are no unvisited neighbors, the frog stays at the current node, and we return the probability of being there.
   - If there are neighbors, calculate the probability of jumping to each neighbor and sum these probabilities to get the overall probability of being on the target after the designated time.

5. **Memoization**: To optimize the function calls, we store the results for `dfs(node, time_remaining)`, ensuring we do not recompute the probabilities for the same state.

### Implementation

Here's how the above logic translates into Python code in the LeetCode format.



```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def frogProbability(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], t: int, target: int) -> float:
        # Build the graph as an adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in edges:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        # Memoization dictionary to store probabilities
        memo = {}

        def dfs(node, time_remaining, visited):
            # If we run out of time, check if we're at target
            if time_remaining == 0:
                return 1.0 if node == target else 0.0
            
            state_key = (node, time_remaining, visited)
            if state_key in memo:
                return memo[state_key]
            
            # Calculate the probability of jumping to neighbors
            unvisited_neighbors = [neigh for neigh in graph[node] if not (visited & (1 << (neigh - 1)))]
            num_neighbors = len(unvisited_neighbors)
            
            if num_neighbors == 0:
                # No where to jump, probability stays the same
                return 1.0 if node == target else 0.0
            
            probability = 0.0
            for neighbor in unvisited_neighbors:
                probability += (1 / num_neighbors) * dfs(neighbor, time_remaining - 1, visited | (1 << (neighbor - 1)))

            memo[state_key] = probability
            return probability
        
        # Start DFS from vertex 1 (convert target and nodes to 0-based)
        initial_visited = (1 << 0)  # only vertex 1 is visited
        return dfs(1, t, initial_visited)


```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first create a graph using the adjacency list from the edges.
- The `dfs` function explores the probabilities recursively by keeping track of visited nodes using bit masking.
- We check base cases for time and whether the current position is the target.
- We finally initiate the DFS starting from vertex 1 with all nodes initially unvisited except for the starting point.

This implementation adheres to the constraints and efficiently computes the desired probabilities. After placing the code in a LeetCode problem structure, it can be tested directly on that platform.

# 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

### Problem Description 
Given two binary trees `original` and `cloned` and given a reference to a node `target` in the original tree.

The `cloned` tree is a copy of the `original` tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the `cloned` tree.

Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the `target` node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the `cloned` tree.

Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.


Example 1:
Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.


Example 2:
Input: tree = [7], target =  7
Output: 7

Example 3:
Input: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
Output: 4

Example 4:
Input: tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output: 5

Example 5:
Input: tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output: 2

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.

The values of the nodes of the `tree` are unique.

`target` node is a node from the `original` tree and is not `null`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding a reference to a node in the cloned binary tree that corresponds to a given target node in the original binary tree, we'll use a recursive approach. The strategy will be to traverse both the original and the cloned trees simultaneously until we find the target node in the original tree and return the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Node Structure**: We'll assume a `TreeNode` class is provided which represents each node in the binary tree, containing `val`, `left`, and `right`.

2. **Recursive Search**: We can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the original tree. For each node, we check if it matches the `target` node. If it does, we return the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

3. **Traversal**: We will recurse through the left and right children of the current node, maintaining a reference to the corresponding cloned node.

4. **Base Case**: If the current node in the original tree is `None`, we should return `None`. If the `target` is found, return the corresponding node in the `cloned` tree.

5. **Handling Repeated Values**: Since values are unique as per the problem statement, we do not need to handle the case of repeated values.

Let’s implement the solution in Python and format it for LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original: TreeNode, cloned: TreeNode, target: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # Helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(orig_node, cloned_node):
            if orig_node is None:
                return None  # Base case: if we reach the end of the tree
            
            if orig_node is target:
                return cloned_node  # If found the target, return the corresponding cloned node
            
            # Explore left subtree
            left_result = dfs(orig_node.left, cloned_node.left)
            if left_result:  # If found in the left subtree, return the result
                return left_result
            
            # Explore right subtree
            return dfs(orig_node.right, cloned_node.right)  # Search in the right subtree
        
        # Start DFS from the root of both trees
        return dfs(original, cloned)

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **TreeNode Class**: We define a simple `TreeNode` class with an initializer that sets the node's value and pointers to its left and right children.

- **Solution Class**: We define the `Solution` class that contains the method `getTargetCopy`.

- **getTargetCopy Method**: This is the main method where the logic resides. It defines a helper function `dfs` that performs the depth-first search.

- **dfs Helper Function**: 
  - It first checks if `orig_node` is `None`. If so, it returns `None`.
  - It then checks if the current node in the original tree is equal to the `target`. If they are the same, it returns the corresponding node in the cloned tree.
  - It recursively searches in the left subtree and checks if the target was found there.
  - If not found in the left subtree, it continues searching in the right subtree and returns that result.

- **Initial Call to dfs**: We start our search from the roots of both trees.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, since in the worst case, we may need to visit all nodes.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, accounting for the recursive stack.

This solution adheres to the problem constraints and efficiently finds the corresponding node in the cloned tree for the given target node in the original tree.

# 1391. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid

### Problem Description 
Given a m x n `grid`. Each cell of the `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:
1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.

2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.

3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.

4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.

5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.

6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. The path should only follow the streets.

Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.

Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).


Example 4:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]
Output: true

Example 5:
Input: grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]
Output: true

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 300`
`1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether there is a valid path from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)` in the given `grid`, we can model the grid as a graph where each cell connects to its neighbors based on the type of street present. Each street type specifies which neighboring cells you can travel to.

### Solution Explanation
1. **Understanding Movement**: Each cell in the grid has a value from 1 to 6 that determines which directions you can move to from that cell:
   - `1`: can move left and right
   - `2`: can move up and down
   - `3`: can move left and down
   - `4`: can move right and down
   - `5`: can move left and up
   - `6`: can move right and up

2. **Graph Traversal**: We'll use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the grid starting from `(0, 0)`. We'll make sure to visit a cell only once to avoid cycles and redundant checks.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: While traversing, we need to ensure that we don't go out of bounds of the grid.

4. **Visited Cells**: We'll maintain a set of visited cells to track which cells have already been checked.

5. **Valid Path Criteria**: The movement between cells is valid based on the connection types. For example, if moving from cell `(i, j)` to `(i, j+1)`, we need to ensure that:
   - The street in `(i, j)` allows movement right (type `1` or `4`) and
   - The street in `(i, j+1)` allows movement left (type `1` or `5`)

### Implementation

Here’s how we can implement the solution in Python while adhering to the LeetCode submission format:



```python
class Solution:
    def hasValidPath(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Directions and corresponding valid connections
        directions = {
            1: [(0, 1), (0, -1)],   # right, left
            2: [(1, 0), (-1, 0)],   # down, up
            3: [(0, 1), (1, 0)],     # right, down
            4: [(0, -1), (1, 0)],    # left, down
            5: [(0, 1), (-1, 0)],    # right, up
            6: [(0, -1), (-1, 0)]    # left, up
        }
        
        # Function to specify if we can go from 'from_pos' to 'to_pos'
        def can_move(from_cell, to_cell, direction):
            # from_cell street type defines outgoing
            outgoing_directions = directions[from_cell]
            # to_cell street type defines incoming
            incoming_directions = directions[to_cell]
            return (direction in outgoing_directions) and ((-direction[0], -direction[1]) in incoming_directions)

        # DFS function to find a valid path
        def dfs(x, y):
            if (x, y) == (m - 1, n - 1):
                return True
            
            visited.add((x, y))
            for i, j in directions[grid[x][y]]:
                nx, ny = x + i, y + j
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                    if can_move(grid[x][y], grid[nx][ny], (i, j)):
                        if dfs(nx, ny):
                            return True
            
            return False

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        
        return dfs(0, 0)


```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Function Structure**: The implementation defines the main method `hasValidPath`, where we initialize the direction mapping. The movement from one cell to another is checked by the helper function `can_move`, which checks whether a move is valid based on street types.
  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The DFS function recursively attempts to reach the target cell. If it successfully finds a path to `(m-1, n-1)`, it returns true.

- **Visitation Tracking**: A set named `visited` is used to track cells that have already been explored, preventing infinite loops and redundant searches.

This algorithm efficiently explores all possible valid paths through the grid and ensures all movement restrictions are respected. It should work within the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree

### Problem Description 
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
Output: 8 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  

Example 3:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^5`
`edges.length == n - 1`
`edges[i].length == 2`
`0 <= ai < bi <= n - 1`
`fromi < toi`
`hasApple.length == n`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time required to collect all apples in a tree-like structure defined by vertices and edges. The main idea is to traverse the tree using Depth First Search (DFS) to find all paths to vertices that contain apples and calculate the total distance traveled.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Tree Representation**:
   The tree is represented using an adjacency list. Each vertex points to a list of its neighbors (connected vertices).

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   We will perform a DFS starting from the root (vertex 0). The traversal will check if any child node has an apple. If any of the child nodes of a vertex has an apple, we will consider the edge to that child in our result since we need to go to that child and come back.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   Each edge traversal will take 1 second. If we need to visit a vertex with an apple, we will count both the forward and return travel time, which is 2 seconds for each valid edge.

### Implementation Steps

1. Build an adjacency list from the edges to represent the tree.
2. Implement the DFS function that will check if any child has apples and accumulate the time accordingly.
3. Return the total time calculated.

Here’s the full Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToCollectApples(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], hasApple: List[bool]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Build the adjacency list for the tree representation
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        # Step 2: Define the DFS function
        def dfs(node, parent):
            total_time = 0
            
            # Explore all neighbors
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                # Avoid going back to parent
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                # Perform DFS on the child node
                child_time = dfs(neighbor, node)
                
                # If the child subtree has apples, we need to visit this edge
                if child_time > 0 or hasApple[neighbor]:
                    total_time += child_time + 2  # 1 for going and 1 for coming back
            
            return total_time
        
        # Step 3: Start DFS from the root node (0)
        return dfs(0, -1)


```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `n` is the number of vertices.
   - `edges` is a list of edges that connect the vertices.
   - `hasApple` is a boolean list indicating which vertices have apples.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   We create an adjacency list `graph` where each index corresponds to a vertex, and each vertex contains a list of its neighbors.

3. **DFS Function**:
   The `dfs` function takes the current node and its parent as arguments. It recursively checks all the neighboring vertices. If any node within a subtree has an apple, it adds to the total time required (with the consideration of traveling back).

4. **Final Output**:
   The function returns the total time required to collect all apples by starting from vertex 0, traversing the necessary edges, and returning.

This algorithm operates in O(n) time complexity since we visit each vertex and edge only once, making it efficient and suitable for the input constraints.

# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree `root`, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.

Root Node (3) is always a good node.

Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.

Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting "good" nodes in a binary tree, we will traverse the tree using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. A node is considered "good" if, along the path from the root to this node, there are no nodes with a value greater than the value of the node in question.

The main steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Tree Traversal**: We will use DFS to explore each node in the tree.
2. **Tracking Maximum Value**: While traversing, we will keep track of the maximum value encountered along the path from the root to the current node.
3. **Counting Good Nodes**: For each node, we check if its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value encountered so far. If it is, we count it as a good node and update the maximum.
4. **Recursive Function**: We will implement a recursive helper function that will take the current node and the maximum value encountered so far.

### Implementation

Below is the Python code that implements the above approach:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node: TreeNode, max_val: int) -> int:
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            # Check if the current node is "good"
            good_node_count = 1 if node.val >= max_val else 0
            
            # Update the maximum value seen so far on this path
            new_max_val = max(max_val, node.val)
            
            # Recur for left and right children
            good_node_count += dfs(node.left, new_max_val)
            good_node_count += dfs(node.right, new_max_val)
            
            return good_node_count
            
        # Start the DFS with the root node and its value as the initial max value
        return dfs(root, root.val)


```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **TreeNode Class**: A basic definition of the binary tree node.
2. **Solution Class**: Contains the main method `goodNodes`.
   - `goodNodes` initializes the DFS call. It begins with the root node and the root's value as the initial maximum value.
3. **DFS Function**:
   - **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, it returns 0 (no good nodes).
   - **Counting Good Nodes**: It checks if the current node is good by comparing its value with the maximum value along the path. 
   - **Update Maximum**: It calculates the new maximum value as the maximum of the current node value and the previous maximum.
   - **Recursive Calls**: It calls itself for left and right children and sums the counts of good nodes from both subtrees.
4. **Return Value**: The total count of good nodes is returned.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this can go up to O(N).

This implementation works effectively for the given constraints and efficiently counts good nodes in the binary tree.

# 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.


Example 1:
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).


Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).


Example 3:
Input: root = [9]
Output: 1

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.

`1 <= Node.val <= 9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the number of pseudo-palindromic paths in a binary tree, we'll need to traverse the tree and track the counts of node values from the root to each leaf node. A path can be considered pseudo-palindromic if at most one digit appears an odd number of times, as this allows for the possibility of rearranging the path values into a palindrome.

### Solution Approach

1. **Tree Traversal**: We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain a count of each digit (1 through 9) encountered along the path.
   
2. **Odd Counts**: Use a counter (or an array with size 10, indexed from 0 to 9) to track how many times each digit has appeared on the current path. At any point, if more than one digit has an odd count, that path cannot produce a pseudo-palindrome.

3. **Leaf Node Check**: When we reach a leaf node (a node with no children), we will check our counts; if there is at most one digit with an odd count, we will count that path as a pseudo-palindrome.

4. **Backtracking**: After exploring a node's paths, we will backtrack by decrementing the count of the current node's value before returning up the tree.

5. **Complexity Consideration**: The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes, since each node is processed once.

Here is the structured implementation of the above approach in Python according to the LeetCode style:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, count):
            if not node:
                return 0

            # Increment the count of the current node's value
            count[node.val] += 1
            
            # If we're at a leaf node, check the condition
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                # Count how many digits have an odd count
                odd_count = sum(1 for c in count if c % 2 == 1)
                # If there's at most one digit with an odd count, it's pseudo-palindromic
                result = 1 if odd_count <= 1 else 0
            else:
                # Continue DFS down the tree
                result = dfs(node.left, count) + dfs(node.right, count)

            # Backtrack: Decrement the count of the current node's value
            count[node.val] -= 1
            
            return result

        # Initialize a count array for digits 1 to 9 (index 0 is unused)
        count = [0] * 10
        return dfs(root, count)

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TreeNode Class**: A simple representation of a tree node containing a value and pointers to left and right children.

2. **Solution Class**: This encapsulates our solution and has the method `pseudoPalindromicPaths`. 

3. **DFS Function**:
   - It takes the current node and the count array as parameters.
   - It increments the count for the current node's value.
   - If we've reached a leaf node, it checks how many values have odd counts.
   - It sums the results from each path (recursive calls to left and right children).
   - After exploring a path, it decrements the current node's count to backtrack.
   
4. **Main Functionality**: The count array tracks occurrences of each digit from 1 to 9, and we start the DFS from the root of the tree.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the problem constraints while handling up to 100,000 nodes.

# 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero

### Problem Description 
There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a road from city `a` to `b`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

It's guaranteed that each city can reach the city 0 after reorder.


Example 1:
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).


Example 2:
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).


Example 3:
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
`connections.length == n-1`
`connections[i].length == 2`
`0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= n-1`
`connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of reorienting the roads in such a way that all cities can reach the capital city (city 0), we can approach the problem using Depth-First Search (DFS). The idea is to traverse the tree and count how many edges need to be reversed in order for all cities to have a way to reach the capital. 

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Graph Structure**:
   - The cities and roads form a tree. In a tree structure with `n` cities, there will always be `n-1` edges. Since there is only one path between any two nodes, the graph is fully connected.

2. **Direction of Roads**:
   - Each road (or edge) can be oriented in a direction. If an edge is from city `a` to city `b`, it means you can travel from `a` to `b`, but not from `b` to `a` unless explicitly reversed.

3. **The Goal**:
   - We need to ensure that every city can reach city 0. To achieve this, we need to traverse the graph and count the edges that point away from city 0 because those are the ones that will need to be reversed.

4. **Graph Representation**:
   - We'll use an adjacency list to represent our graph. In addition, we will prepare a count of how many roads are currently directed towards and away from the capital.

5. **DFS Traversal**:
   - We'll perform a DFS starting from city 0. During this traversal, we will visit each connected city and check the direction of the connecting edge. If the edge is oriented away from city 0 (i.e., pointing to a child node), we need to increment our counter since we'll need to reverse that edge.

### Python Code Using DFS:

Here is the code which implements the above logic:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Create a graph with adjacency list representation
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for a, b in connections:
            graph[a].append((b, 1))  # b is a neighbor of a and the initial direction
            graph[b].append((a, 0))  # a is a neighbor of b and the inverse direction
        
        def dfs(city: int, parent: int) -> int:
            changes = 0
            for neighbor, direction in graph[city]:
                if neighbor != parent:  # Avoid going back to the parent
                    changes += direction  # Count if we need to reverse this edge
                    changes += dfs(neighbor, city)  # Continue DFS
            return changes
        
        # Start DFS from capital city 0 with no parent (-1)
        return dfs(0, -1)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Graph Construction**:
  - We build the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists where each city can point to its connected neighbors along with a flag indicating the direction of the edge (1 if it needs to be changed, 0 if it does not).

- **DFS Function**:
  - The `dfs` function takes the current city and its parent city to avoid cycling back. It counts how many changes are needed by checking the direction flags.

- **Return Value**:
  - The result is obtained by invoking `dfs` starting from city 0 and initializing parent as `-1`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of cities, since we are visiting each edge and node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the graph structure.

This solution is efficient and works well within the constraints provided in the problem description.

# 1469. Find All The Lonely Nodes

### Problem Description 
In a binary tree, a lonely node is a node that is the only child of its parent node. The root of the tree is not lonely because it does not have a parent node.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return an array containing the values of all lonely nodes in the tree. Return the list in any order.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: [4]
Explanation: Light blue node is the only lonely node.

Node 1 is the root and is not lonely.

Nodes 2 and 3 have the same parent and are not lonely.


Example 2:
Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2]
Output: [6,2]
Explanation: Light blue nodes are lonely nodes.

Please remember that order doesn't matter, [2,6] is also an acceptable answer.


Example 3:
Input: root = [11,99,88,77,null,null,66,55,null,null,44,33,null,null,22]
Output: [77,55,33,66,44,22]
Explanation: Nodes 99 and 88 share the same parent. Node 11 is the root.

All other nodes are lonely.


Example 4:
Input: root = [197]
Output: []

Example 5:
Input: root = [31,null,78,null,28]
Output: [78,28]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 1000].`
Each node's value is between `[1, 10^6]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding lonely nodes in a binary tree, we first need to understand what a lonely node is. A lonely node is defined as a node that has only one child. Given this, we can traverse the tree in a way that allows us to check for each node whether it has only one child.

### Approach
We will perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree. During the traversal:
1. For each node, we will check if it has a left child, a right child, or both.
2. If a node has only a left child, we will add the value of that left child to our result list.
3. If a node has only a right child, we will add the value of that right child to our result list.

We will use a recursive approach for the DFS traversal.

### Implementation
Below is the code that implements the above logic in a manner compatible with the LeetCode platform. The function `getLonelyNodes` will take the root of the binary tree as input and return a list of values of all lonely nodes.



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def getLonelyNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> list[int]:
        lonely_nodes = []
        
        def dfs(node):
            # Base case: if the node is None, return
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Check if the left child exists
            if node.left and not node.right:
                lonely_nodes.append(node.left.val)
            # Check if the right child exists
            if node.right and not node.left:
                lonely_nodes.append(node.right.val)
            
            # Recurse left and right
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)
        
        # Start DFS from the root
        dfs(root)
        return lonely_nodes

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **TreeNode Class**: This is a standard definition of a binary tree node with its constructor initializing the value, left child, and right child.
  
2. **Solution Class**: This houses the main method `getLonelyNodes`.
  
3. **getLonelyNodes Method**: 
   - We initialize an empty list `lonely_nodes` to store the values of lonely nodes.
   - We define a nested function `dfs` that will perform the depth-first search.
   
4. **dfs Method**:
   - We check if the current node is `None`. If it is, we return immediately since there is nothing to process.
   - We check the conditions for lonely nodes: if a node has only a left child, we append that child's value to `lonely_nodes`. We do the same for a node that has only a right child.
   - Finally, we invoke the `dfs` method recursively on the left and right children of the current node.

5. **Return Statement**: After the DFS completes, we return the `lonely_nodes` list.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(h) \) where \( h \) is the height of the tree due to the recursive call stack.

This solution efficiently finds all lonely nodes in the binary tree as required.

# 1485. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer

### Problem Description 
A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a deep copy of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`. `NodeCopy` class is just a clone of `Node` class with the same attributes and constructors.


Example 1:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Explanation: The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].

The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].

The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.


Example 2:
Input: root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Explanation: The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

Example 4:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 5:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[0, 1000].`
Each node's value is between `[1, 10^6]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of cloning a binary tree with an additional random pointer, we'll implement a depth-first traversal of the tree while using a dictionary (or hashmap) to map original nodes to their corresponding cloned nodes. This will allow us to efficiently copy both the `left`, `right`, and `random` pointers for each node in the tree.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this:

1. **Create Data Structures**:
   We'll define two classes, `Node` for the original tree and `NodeCopy` for the clone. Each class will have properties for `val`, `left`, `right`, and an additional `random` pointer.

2. **Traversal and Cloning**:
   We will use a recursive function to traverse the tree:
   - For each node, we will create a new instance of `NodeCopy`.
   - Store the mapping of the original node to the cloned node in a dictionary.
   - Recursively call the function for the left and right children to ensure they're cloned.
   - After cloning, we'll set the `random` pointer using the mapping we created.

3. **Return the Root of the Cloned Tree**:
   Finally, we return the root of the cloned tree.

Let's write this in code according to the structure mentioned above, so that it can be directly run on LeetCode:



```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, random=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.random = random

class NodeCopy:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, random=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.random = random

class Solution:
    def copyTree(self, root: Node) -> NodeCopy:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # This dictionary will map original nodes to their corresponding cloned nodes
        mapping = {}
        
        # Helper function to perform Tree traversal and cloning
        def clone(node):
            if not node:
                return None
            
            # If this node has already been cloned, return the cloned node
            if node in mapping:
                return mapping[node]

            # Create a new copied node
            new_node = NodeCopy(node.val)
            mapping[node] = new_node  # Store the mapping
            
            # Recursion for left and right children
            new_node.left = clone(node.left)
            new_node.right = clone(node.right)
            
            return new_node

        # Start the cloning process
        cloned_root = clone(root)

        # Set up the random pointers for the cloned nodes
        def set_random(node, clone_node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Set the random pointer using the mapping
            clone_node.random = mapping.get(node.random, None)
            
            # Continue for left and right children
            set_random(node.left, clone_node.left)
            set_random(node.right, clone_node.right)

        # Set random pointers in the cloned tree
        set_random(root, cloned_root)
        
        return cloned_root

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Node and NodeCopy Definitions**:
   We defined the `Node` class for the original tree, which contains `val`, `left`, `right`, and a `random` pointer. The `NodeCopy` class is structurally identical and represents the cloned tree.

2. **copyTree Function**:
   This function starts the cloning process:
   - If the input root is `None`, we return `None`.
   - A dictionary named `mapping` stores the relationship between original nodes and their corresponding copies.
   - The `clone` function is a recursive helper that does the deep copy of the tree.

3. **Random Pointer Setup**:
   After cloning the tree structure, we traverse the original tree once again using `set_random` to update the `random` pointers for the copied nodes, utilizing our mapping.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as we visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) to store the mapping of nodes.

This implementation efficiently deep copies the original tree while respecting the structure and pointers, making it suitable for various trees as described in the problem statement.


# 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.

The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.

The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.


Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
`edges[i].length == 3`
`0 <= ai < bi < n`
`1 <= weighti <= 1000`
All pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree (MST) of an undirected, weighted graph, we can proceed with the following strategy:

### Strategy:

1. **Understanding MST**: The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight and contains no cycles. We use a method to compute the MST, specifically the Kruskal's algorithm, which is efficient for edge-based representations like the one given.

2. **Edge Classification**:
   - **Critical Edge**: An edge is critical if removing it increases the total weight of the MST.
   - **Pseudo-Critical Edge**: An edge is pseudo-critical if including it can create an MST, but we can still form MSTs that do not necessarily include this edge.

3. **Steps to Determine Edge Types**:
   - First, calculate the weight of the MST using all edges.
   - For each edge, determine if removing it causes the MST weight to increase.
   - For pseudo-critical edges, include it temporarily and check if it still allows forming an MST with the lowest possible weight.

4. **Union-Find Structure**: We will use a union-find (or disjoint-set) structure to help manage and identify connected components efficiently during the MST calculations.

### Python Code Implementation:

The following code implements the above logic:



```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
        
    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]
    
    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1
            return True
        return False

def kruskal(n, edges, exclude_edge=None, include_edge=None):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    total_weight = 0
    edges_used = 0
    
    if include_edge is not None:
        a, b, weight = edges[include_edge]
        uf.union(a, b)
        total_weight += weight
        edges_used += 1
        
    for i, (a, b, weight) in enumerate(edges):
        if i == exclude_edge:
            continue
        if uf.union(a, b):
            total_weight += weight
            edges_used += 1
            
    if edges_used == n - 1:
        return total_weight
    return float('inf')

def findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(n, edges):
    # Step 1: Add index to each edge for result tracking.
    indexed_edges = [(u, v, weight, idx) for idx, (u, v, weight) in enumerate(edges)]
    # Step 2: Sort edges based on the weight
    indexed_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Step 3: Find the weight of the MST with all edges
    total_mst_weight = kruskal(n, indexed_edges)
    
    critical_edges = []
    pseudo_critical_edges = []
    
    for i in range(len(indexed_edges)):
        # Check if edge i is critical
        if kruskal(n, indexed_edges, exclude_edge=i) > total_mst_weight:
            critical_edges.append(indexed_edges[i][3])
        # Check if edge i is pseudo-critical
        elif kruskal(n, indexed_edges, include_edge=i) == total_mst_weight:
            pseudo_critical_edges.append(indexed_edges[i][3])
    
    return [critical_edges, pseudo_critical_edges]

# Example Usage
# n = 5
# edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
# result = findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(n, edges)
# print(result)  # Expected output: [[0, 1], [2, 3, 4, 5]]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **UnionFind Class**: This class implements path compression and union by rank which makes the union-find operations efficient.

2. **kruskal Function**: This function implements the Kruskal’s algorithm to determine the weight of the MST, optionally excluding or including certain edges.

3. **findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges Function**:
   - Edges are indexed and sorted based on their weights.
   - The weight of the MST using all edges is calculated first.
   - Each edge is evaluated to see if it is critical (if the MST weight increases when it’s excluded) or pseudo-critical (if it can still yield the same MST when included).

### Conclusion:
This code efficiently determines the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the graph's MST using Kruskal's algorithm combined with a union-find data structure. The results are returned as specified in the problem statement and can be tested directly on LeetCode.

# 1490. Clone N-ary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a `root` of an N-ary tree, return a deep copy (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its children.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Follow up: Can your solution work for the graph problem?

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Constraints:
The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of creating a deep copy (clone) of an N-ary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This involves traversing the original tree and recursively copying each node and its children into a new tree structure.

Below is the detailed implementation of the solution, including the definition of the Node class and the function to clone the tree:



```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

class Solution:
    def cloneTree(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        """
        This function takes the root of an N-ary tree and returns a deep copy of it.
        
        :param root: Node - The root of the N-ary tree to be cloned.
        :return: Node - The root of the cloned N-ary tree.
        """
        # If the root is None, return None since there is nothing to clone
        if root is None:
            return None
        
        # Create a new node with the same value as the root
        clone_node = Node(root.val)
        
        # Recursively clone each child and append to the children of the clone_node
        for child in root.children:
            clone_node.children.append(self.cloneTree(child))
        
        return clone_node

# Example usage:
# This part would not be part of the solution on LeetCode but demonstrates how to use the function.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Constructing the tree for the first example:
    # Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
    n3 = Node(3, [Node(5), Node(6)])
    root = Node(1, [n3, Node(2), Node(4)])

    solution = Solution()
    cloned_tree = solution.cloneTree(root)

    # To verify the structure of the cloned tree, you might implement a function to print its structure.

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Node Class Definition**: 
   - We define a class `Node` which simulates the structure of the nodes in the N-ary tree. Each `Node` instance has an integer value (`val`) and a list of children nodes (`children`).

2. **Solution Class**:
   - In the `Solution` class, we implement the method `cloneTree`, which takes the root of the N-ary tree as input.
  
3. **Base Case**:
   - If the input `root` is `None`, we return `None` immediately since there is no node to clone.

4. **Cloning the Node**:
   - We create a new Node instance (`clone_node`) with the same value as the original root node.
  
5. **Recursively Cloning Children**:
   - For each child in the original node's `children`, we recursively call `cloneTree`, which allows us to clone that subtree, and append it to `clone_node`'s children.

6. **Returning the Cloned Node**:
   - Finally, we return the cloned node which now contains the deep copy of the entire subtree.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited and cloned once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case, which is the space used on the recursion stack and the space needed to store the cloned tree.

This solution can efficiently handle the constraints given in the problem, successfully cloning an N-ary tree having a depth of up to 1000 and a total of up to 10,000 nodes.

# 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label

### Problem Description 
Given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` `edges`. The root of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The `edges` array is given on the form `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `ith` node which have the same label as node `i`.

A subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"
Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Explanation: Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.

Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = "bbbb"
Output: [4,2,1,1]
Explanation: The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.

The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.


Example 3:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]], labels = "aabab"
Output: [3,2,1,1,1]

Example 4:
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[3,4],[4,5]], labels = "cbabaa"
Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]

Example 5:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6]], labels = "aaabaaa"
Output: [6,5,4,1,3,2,1]

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^5`
`edges.length == n - 1`
`edges[i].length == 2`
`0 <= ai, bi < n`
`ai != bi`
`labels.length == n`
`labels` is consisting of only of lower-case English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting nodes with the same label in the subtree of each node in the provided tree, we can use Depth First Search (DFS). The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root node (node `0`), counting the number of occurrences of each character in the subtree rooted at each node.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Graph Representation**: First, we need to represent the tree using an adjacency list. Each node will have a list of its connected children.

2. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a DFS starting from the root node. For each node:
   - Count how many nodes in its subtree share the same label.
   - Propagate this information up to its parent, using a counting dictionary to keep track of the counts of labels in each node's subtree.

3. **Counting Subtree Labels**: While traversing, we will maintain a dictionary to count occurrences of labels and at the end of each node’s DFS call, we can assign the count of the current node's label to our result list.

4. **Return Value**: After completing the DFS traversal, we will have our answer in the result array.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python, designed to be run directly on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countSubtrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], labels: str) -> List[int]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Step 1: Build the graph (adjacency list)
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # Step 2: Create result list and visited set
        result = [0] * n
        visited = [False] * n
        
        # Step 3: DFS function to count labels in subtree
        def dfs(node: int) -> defaultdict:
            nonlocal visited
            visited[node] = True
            
            # Count of labels in the subtree
            count = defaultdict(int)
            # Include the current node's label
            count[labels[node]] += 1
            
            # Visit all children
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    child_count = dfs(neighbor)
                    # Combine counts from the child
                    for label in child_count:
                        count[label] += child_count[label]
            
            # Save result for the current node
            result[node] = count[labels[node]]
            return count
        
        # Start DFS from the root node (0)
        dfs(0)
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Graph Representation (`graph`)**:
   - We use a `defaultdict` of lists to build our adjacency list for the tree from the `edges` input.

2. **DFS Function** (`dfs(node)`):
   - Marks the node as visited and initializes a count dictionary.
   - It increments the count for the current node's label.
   - For each unvisited neighbor (child node), it recursively calls `dfs` to get counts from the subtree rooted at that neighbor and combines them with the current node's count.
   - Stores the count of the current node's label in the `result` list.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After the DFS completes at the root, we have filled in our `result` list with the number of nodes in the subtree of each node that have the same label as that node.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since each node and edge is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the graph representation and the recursion stack in DFS.

This approach efficiently counts the labels in each subtree and adheres to the problem constraints.

# 1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `distance`. A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to `distance`.

Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], distance = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The good pairs are [4,5] and [6,7] with shortest path = 2. The pair [4,6] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them is 4.


Example 3:
Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2], distance = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The only good pair is [2,5].


Example 4:
Input: root = [100], distance = 1
Output: 0

Example 5:
Input: root = [1,1,1], distance = 2
Output: 1

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 2^10].`
Each node's value is between `[1, 100]`.

`1 <= distance <= 10`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting good leaf node pairs in a binary tree given a distance constraint, we can follow a structured approach. 

## Problem Explanation
In a binary tree, a leaf node is a node that does not have any children. A pair of leaf nodes is considered "good" if the shortest path between them is less than or equal to the given `distance`. The shortest path between two leaf nodes can be represented in terms of the distances from each leaf to their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).

To determine this:
1. We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree.
2. As we traverse, we will collect the distances from each leaf node back up to its parents, with the goal of identifying pairs that satisfy the distance condition.

### Steps:
1. Define a recursive function that will traverse the tree and return a list of distances from each leaf node up to its ancestors.
2. For each node, if it is not a leaf (i.e., it has children), you'll compute the distances returned from its child nodes, and check how many pairs can be formed that are within the allowed distance.
3. Utilize a dictionary to count how many leaf nodes are found at each distance from the current node.
4. For each valid distance from a child node, check how many pairs can be formed with other distances that satisfy the maximum allowed distance.

### Implementation
Here's how the Python code looks in a format suitable for submission to LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, root: TreeNode, distance: int) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            if not node.left and not node.right:  # If it's a leaf
                return [1]
            left_distances = dfs(node.left)
            right_distances = dfs(node.right)
            # Count good pairs
            count = 0
            for ld in left_distances:
                for rd in right_distances:
                    if ld + rd <= distance:
                        count += 1
            # Prepare the new distances for the current node
            new_distances = [d + 1 for d in left_distances + right_distances if d + 1 < distance]
            return new_distances, count
        
        # Count good pairs
        total_count = 0
        _, count_pairs = dfs(root)
        return count_pairs
    
# Example testing structure (not needed on LeetCode but useful for local tests)
# Note: You can use below code to test if you want to run locally.
# root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, None, TreeNode(4)), TreeNode(3))
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.countPairs(root, 3))  # Output: 1

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **TreeNode Class**: Defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **Solution Class**: Contains the `countPairs` method to compute the number of good leaf node pairs.
3. **DFS Function**:
   - It performs a depth-first search on the tree.
   - If it encounters a leaf node, it returns a list containing the distance `1`.
   - If it is not a leaf, it calls itself recursively for left and right children and collects distances.
   - It counts how many good pairs can be formed with combinations of distances from left and right children.
   - It returns a list of distances incremented by `1` for the parent node and the count of good pairs found.

### Final Note
By leveraging a recursive approach and efficiently counting pairs based on distance, we ensure that our solution adheres to the constraints and performs effectively, even for the upper limits of the input size.

# 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid

### Problem Description 
Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in `grid`.

A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the same value of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)` is invalid because from `(1, 2)` we visited `(1, 1)` which was the last visited cell.

Return `true` if any cycle of the same value exists in `grid`, otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are two valid cycles shown in different colors in the image below:

Example 2:
Input: grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]
Output: true
Explanation: There is only one valid cycle highlighted in the image below:

Example 3:
Input: grid = [["a","b","b"],["b","z","b"],["b","b","a"]]
Output: false

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m <= 500`
`1 <= n <= 500`
`grid` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of detecting cycles in a 2D grid of characters where the cycles consist of adjacent cells with the same character, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). The key points to consider are:

1. A cycle must return to the starting cell and must have a length of at least 4.
2. We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
3. We cannot move back to the cell we just came from.

### Approach
1. We traverse each cell in the grid. If the cell has not been visited, we initiate a DFS from that cell.
2. During the DFS, we keep track of the previous cell to prevent immediate backtracking.
3. If we reach a cell that has already been visited and is the starting cell of our DFS path (but not through the immediately previous cell), we have detected a cycle.
4. We also mark cells as visited and unmark them when we backtrack to maintain the correct visited state for other paths.
5. If we find a cycle during any DFS call, we return true. If no cycles are found after exploring all cells, we return false.

### Code Implementation
Here's how we can implement this in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def containsCycle(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return False
        
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        
        def dfs(x, y, px, py):
            if (x, y) in visited:
                return True
            
            visited.add((x, y))
            for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == grid[x][y]:
                    if (nx, ny) != (px, py):  # Ensure we are not returning to the previous cell
                        if dfs(nx, ny, x, y):
                            return True
            
            visited.remove((x, y))  # Unmark the cell after exploring
            return False
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i, j) not in visited:
                    if dfs(i, j, -1, -1):  # starting with no previous cell
                        return True
        
        return False

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Initialization**: We check if the grid is empty and initialize variables `m`, `n` for the dimensions of the grid and a set `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
2. **DFS Function**:
   - The function accepts the current cell coordinates `(x, y)` and the previous cell coordinates `(px, py)`.
   - If the current cell has already been visited, we have found a cycle.
   - We add the current cell to `visited`, and explore its neighboring cells.
   - For each neighbor, if it has the same character and is not the cell we just came from, we call DFS recursively.
   - After exploring, we remove the cell from `visited` to allow other paths to consider it again.
3. **Main Loop**: We iterate through each cell in the grid and call DFS where necessary. If any call to DFS returns true, we immediately return true.
4. **Final Return**: If no cycles are found after all cells have been explored, we return false.

This solution effectively checks for cycles in the grid and runs efficiently within the constraints provided.

# 1625. Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `s` of even length consisting of digits from `0` to `9`, and two integers `a` and `b`.

You can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any order on `s`:
Add `a` to all odd indices of `s` (0-indexed). Digits post `9` are cycled back to `0`. For example, if `s = "3456"` and `a = 5`, `s` becomes `"3951"`.

Rotate `s` to the right by `b` positions. For example, if `s = "3456"` and `b = 1`, `s` becomes `"6345"`.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on `s`.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. For example, `"0158"` is lexicographically smaller than `"0190"` because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and `'5'` comes before `'9'`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "5525", a = 9, b = 2
Output: "2050"
Explanation: We can apply the following operations:
Start:  "5525"
Rotate: "2555"
Add:    "2454"
Add:    "2353"
Rotate: "5323"
Add:    "5222"
​​​​​​​Add:    "5121"
​​​​​​​Rotate: "2151"
​​​​​​​Add:    "2050"​​​​​​​​​​​​
There is no way to obtain a string that is lexicographically smaller then "2050".


Example 2:
Input: s = "74", a = 5, b = 1
Output: "24"
Explanation: We can apply the following operations:
Start:  "74"
Rotate: "47"
​​​​​​​Add:    "42"
​​​​​​​Rotate: "24"​​​​​​​​​​​​
There is no way to obtain a string that is lexicographically smaller then "24".


Example 3:
Input: s = "0011", a = 4, b = 2
Output: "0011"
Explanation: There are no sequence of operations that will give us a lexicographically smaller string than "0011".


Example 4:
Input: s = "43987654", a = 7, b = 3
Output: "00553311"

Constraints:
`2 <= s.length <= 100`
`s.length` is even.

`s` consists of digits from `0` to `9` only.

`1 <= a <= 9`
`1 <= b <= s.length - 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of obtaining the lexicographically smallest string from the given string \( s \) using the defined operations, we can break the operations down into their mechanics and explore all possible resultant strings through systematic manipulation. Here's a step-by-step solution using Python, adhering to the LeetCode submission format.

### Explanation:

1. **Operations Overview**:
   - **Add `a`**: This operation updates all digits at odd indices by adding `a` to them and wrapping around (i.e., if the digit becomes greater than 9, it wraps back to 0).
   - **Rotate `s`**: This rotates the string to the right by `b` positions.

2. **Approach**:
   - We want to achieve the smallest possible string by applying the two operations in any order.
   - For each potential rotation of the string, we'll apply the adding operation up to 10 times (since adding 10 would bring the digit back to its original value). This will allow us to explore how the string can be modified and minimized.
   - After exploring all combinations of rotations and increments, we will keep track of the minimum string encountered.

### Implementation:

Here's how you can implement this in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def findLexSmallestString(self, s: str, a: int, b: int) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        min_string = s
        
        # Function to add 'a' to odd indices in the string
        def add(s):
            return ''.join(str((int(s[i]) + a) % 10) if i % 2 != 0 else s[i] for i in range(n))

        # Try all rotations
        for i in range(n):
            # Rotate string
            rotated = s[i:] + s[:i]
            current_string = rotated
            
            # Try adding 'a' multiple times
            for _ in range(10):  # max of 10 additions to cycle through all possibilities
                current_string = add(current_string)
                min_string = min(min_string, current_string)
                
        return min_string

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.findLexSmallestString("5525", 9, 2))  # Output: "2050"
print(solution.findLexSmallestString("74", 5, 1))    # Output: "24"
print(solution.findLexSmallestString("0011", 4, 2))  # Output: "0011"
print(solution.findLexSmallestString("43987654", 7, 3)) # Output: "00553311"

```

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Function Declaration**: `findLexSmallestString` takes the string `s`, and two integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Rotation and Modification**:
   - We traverse all possible rotations of the string using a loop that iterates \( n \) times, where \( n \) is the length of the string.
   - For each rotation, we create a new `current_string` based on that rotation.
3. **Adding Operation**: We define a helper function `add` which generates a new string by applying the addition to odd indices.
4. **Finding Minimum**: After each addition, we check if the new string is lexicographically smaller than our current `min_string` and update accordingly.
5. **Result**: At the end of all operations and rotations, the smallest string found is returned.

This solution is efficient enough given the constraints and directly implements the operations while checking for the smallest possible string efficiently.

# 1631. Path With Minimum Effort

### Problem Description 
You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.


Example 1:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.

This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.


Example 2:
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].


Example 3:
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.


Constraints:
`rows == heights.length`
`columns == heights[i].length`
`1 <= rows, columns <= 100`
`1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid of heights, we can employ a pathfinding algorithm that builds on the concepts of Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). Specifically, we'll use a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm to minimize the maximum effort along a path.

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Understanding Effort**: The effort on a path is defined as the maximum absolute difference in heights between adjacent cells. We want to minimize this maximum difference as we navigate through the height grid.

2. **Priority Queue**: We'll use a priority queue (or a min-heap) to always expand the path with the current least maximum effort first. This aligns well with Dijkstra’s algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest path with weighted edges.

3. **Direction Vectors**: Since we can move up, down, left, or right, we'll define direction vectors to help navigate the grid.

4. **Distance Array**: We'll maintain a 2D distance array to track the minimum maximum effort required to reach each cell. If we find a better path to a cell, we'll update the distance and push the new effort into the priority queue.

5. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize a min-heap and push the starting cell (0, 0) with an effort of 0 (since there's no movement yet).
   - While the heap is not empty, pop the cell with the smallest maximum effort.
   - If we reach the bottom-right cell, we return the effort.
   - For each adjacent cell, calculate the potential new effort, update if this path is better, and push it into the heap.

This approach ensures that we efficiently explore the paths while maintaining focus on minimizing the maximum effort.

### Python Code Implementation:

Here’s how this can be implemented in Python, following the LeetCode submission format:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumEffortPath(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not heights or not heights[0]: 
            return 0
        
        rows, cols = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up
        
        # Min-heap (effort, row, col)
        min_heap = [(0, 0, 0)]  # Start from (0, 0) with 0 effort
        # Effort matrix initialized to infinity
        effort = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        effort[0][0] = 0
        
        while min_heap:
            curr_effort, x, y = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            # If we reach the bottom-right corner
            if x == rows - 1 and y == cols - 1:
                return curr_effort
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols:
                    # Calculate the effort required to move to the neighbor
                    new_effort = max(curr_effort, abs(heights[nx][ny] - heights[x][y]))
                    if new_effort < effort[nx][ny]:  # If we found a less maximum effort path
                        effort[nx][ny] = new_effort
                        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_effort, nx, ny))
        
        return 0  # In theory, we should not reach here.

```

### Key Points:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(V \log V)\), where \(V\) is the number of cells (i.e., \(rows \times columns\)).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(V)\) due to the `effort` array and the priority queue.

By using this approach, we can efficiently find the minimum effort needed to travel through the grid.

# 1666. Change the Root of a Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree and a `leaf` node, reroot the tree so that the `leaf` is the new root.

You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path starting from the `leaf` up to the `root`​​​ excluding the root:
If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child.

`cur`'s original parent becomes `cur`'s left child. Note that in this process the original parent's pointer to `cur` becomes `null`, making it have at most one child.

Return the new root of the rerooted tree.

Note: Ensure that your solution sets the `Node.parent` pointers correctly after rerooting or you will receive "Wrong Answer".


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 7
Output: [7,2,null,5,4,3,6,null,null,null,1,null,null,0,8]

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 0
Output: [0,1,null,3,8,5,null,null,null,6,2,null,null,7,4]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.

`-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
All `Node.val` are unique.

`leaf` exist in the tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rerooting a binary tree with a given leaf node, we need to consider the structural changes that occur when we reroot the tree. The steps required involve pointing the `parent` of each node appropriately and adjusting the left and right children of the nodes involved.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Define the TreeNode Class**: This class represents each node in the binary tree. Each node has a value, pointers to its left and right children, and a pointer to its parent.

2. **Find the Path from Leaf to Root**: We need to traverse the tree from the given `leaf` node up to the `root`, recording the path. This is done using a depth-first search (DFS).

3. **Re-rooting Process**: Once we've obtained the path, we reroot the tree starting from the node just above the `leaf` node:
   - For each node on the path, if it has a left child, we make that left child the right child.
   - The node's original parent becomes its new left child.
   - Finally, we set the parent's reference to the current node to `None`.

4. **Return the New Root**: After rerooting, we return the new root of the tree.

### Python Code Implementation

Here's how this is coded following the LeetCode format:



```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, parent=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = parent

class Solution:
    def reroot(self, root: TreeNode, leaf: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # Step 1: Find the path from leaf to root
        path = []
        current = leaf
        
        # Traverse up to root to collect path
        while current:
            path.append(current)
            current = current.parent
        
        # The new root will be the leaf itself
        new_root = path[-1]
        
        # Step 2: Reroot the tree
        for i in range(len(path) - 1):
            cur = path[i]
            parent = path[i + 1]
            
            if cur.left:
                # Make cur.left become cur.right
                cur.right = cur.left
                cur.left = None
            
            # Set the parent as the new left child of cur
            cur.left = parent
            
            # The parent's pointer to cur should be null
            if parent:
                if parent.left == cur:
                    parent.left = None
                else:
                    parent.right = None
            
            # Update the parent's pointer to point back to cur which is now the child
            parent.parent = cur
        
        new_root.parent = None  # The new root's parent should be None
        return new_root

# Example Usage:
# Construct a binary tree for testing
#       3
#      / \
#     5   1
#    / \ / \
#   6  2 0  8
#     / \
#    7   4

root = TreeNode(3)
n5 = TreeNode(5)
n1 = TreeNode(1)
n6 = TreeNode(6)
n2 = TreeNode(2)
n0 = TreeNode(0)
n8 = TreeNode(8)
n7 = TreeNode(7)
n4 = TreeNode(4)

root.left = n5
root.right = n1
n5.parent = root
n1.parent = root
n5.left = n6
n5.right = n2
n6.parent = n5
n2.parent = n5
n1.left = n0
n1.right = n8
n0.parent = n1
n8.parent = n1
n2.left = n7
n2.right = n4
n7.parent = n2
n4.parent = n2

# Call method
solution = Solution()
new_root = solution.reroot(root, n7)

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This represents the structure of each node in the binary tree, including its value, left and right children, and its parent.

2. **reroot Method**: This is the core function that reroots the binary tree based on the steps outlined above. It first constructs the path from the leaf to the root and then modifies the tree structure accordingly.

3. **Example Tree Construction**: The example tree is built explicitly, showcasing how to create tree nodes and link them based on the problem description.

4. **Final Rerooting**: The method modifies the tree structure and sets the correct parent pointers, and finally returns the new root.

This implementation should work directly on LeetCode as the format is compatible, and the logic follows the problem's requirements closely.

# 1676. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree IV

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an array of `TreeNode` objects `nodes`, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all the nodes in `nodes`. All the nodes will exist in the tree, and all values of the tree's nodes are unique.

Extending the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of `n` nodes `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has every `pi` as a descendant (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself) for every valid `i`". A descendant of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of nodes 4 and 7 is node 2.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of a single node is the node itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [7,6,2,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of the nodes 7, 6, 2, and 4 is node 5.


Example 4:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 3
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of all the nodes is the root node.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
All `Node.val` are unique.

All `nodes[i]` will exist in the tree.

All `nodes[i]` are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of multiple nodes in a binary tree, we can employ a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm followed by the actual implementation in Python. 

### Algorithm Explanation

1. **Definition of LCA**: The LCA of a set of nodes is the lowest node that has all the nodes in that set as descendants.

2. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a DFS traversal of the tree. For each node, we'll check:
   - If the current node is one of our target nodes.
   - Recursively search for the descendants in the left and right subtrees.

3. **Combining Results**: As we return from the recursion:
   - If we find the first target node in the left subtree and the second in the right subtree, the current node is their LCA.
   - If we find a target node in one of the subtrees but not in the other, we return that node up to the parent level.

4. **Use of a Set for Nodes**: We'll use a set to store the target nodes for O(1) lookups during the traversal.

5. **Post Traversal**: If we traverse the whole tree, the DFS will be able to locate the correct ancestor.

### Python Implementation

Now let's implement the solution. We will define a `TreeNode` class and a `Solution` class with a method to find the LCA:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, nodes: List[TreeNode]) -> TreeNode:
        # Create a set of the values of the nodes of interest
        target_nodes = {node.val for node in nodes}
        
        def dfs(node):
            # Base case: if we reach a null node, return None
            if not node:
                return None
            
            # Check if the current node is one of the target nodes
            is_target = node.val in target_nodes
            
            # Recursively search in the left and right subtrees
            left_lca = dfs(node.left)
            right_lca = dfs(node.right)
            
            # If both left and right are not None, current node is LCA
            if left_lca and right_lca:
                return node
            
            # If either left or right is not None, propagate that result upwards
            return left_lca if left_lca else right_lca if right_lca else node if is_target else None
        
        # Start the DFS from the root
        return dfs(root)


```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This is a standard representation of a node in the binary tree.

2. **Solution Class**: The `lowestCommonAncestor()` method is defined within this class, which:
   - Creates a set of target node values for efficient lookup.
   - Defines a nested helper function `dfs()` that performs the depth-first search.
   - Handles base cases, checks for target nodes, and decides when to return the current node up the stack.

3. **Return Value**: The call to `dfs(root)` will eventually return the lowest common ancestor of all the target nodes.

This code can be tested directly on LeetCode, provided that the `TreeNode` structure is recognized by the platform, and the array of `nodes` is passed in the correct format.

# 1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations

### Problem Description 
You are given two integer arrays, `source` and `target`, both of length `n`. You are also given an array `allowedSwaps` where each `allowedSwaps[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index `ai` and index `bi` (0-indexed) of array `source`. Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices multiple times and in any order.

The Hamming distance of two arrays of the same length, `source` and `target`, is the number of positions where the elements are different. Formally, it is the number of indices `i` for `0 <= i <= n-1` where `source[i] != target[i]` (0-indexed).

Return the minimum Hamming distance of `source` and `target` after performing any amount of swap operations on array `source`.


Example 1:
Input: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [2,1,4,5], allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: source can be transformed the following way:
- Swap indices 0 and 1: source = [2,1,3,4]
- Swap indices 2 and 3: source = [2,1,4,3]
The Hamming distance of source and target is 1 as they differ in 1 position: index 3.


Example 2:
Input: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [1,3,2,4], allowedSwaps = []
Output: 2
Explanation: There are no allowed swaps.

The Hamming distance of source and target is 2 as they differ in 2 positions: index 1 and index 2.


Example 3:
Input: source = [5,1,2,4,3], target = [1,5,4,2,3], allowedSwaps = [[0,4],[4,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`n == source.length == target.length`
`1 <= n <= 105`
`1 <= source[i], target[i] <= 105`
`0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 105`
`allowedSwaps[i].length == 2`
`0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
`ai != bi`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum Hamming distance between two arrays (`source` and `target`) after performing allowed swaps, we need to understand the connectivity of the indices in relation to the allowed swaps. Each swap defines a connection between two indices, which can lead to forming groups of indices where any index can be transformed into any other within the same group.

The overall approach involves the following steps:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We'll use a union-find (or disjoint set union, DSU) data structure to manage which indices can be connected through swaps. This helps in grouping indices that can be swapped.

2. **Group Elements**: After processing the allowed swaps with union-find, we'll classify each element in the `source` array into its respective group based on their root parent.

3. **Count Elements**: For each group, we count how many of each element from both `source` and `target` are present. 

4. **Calculate Minimum Hamming Distance**: For each group, we then calculate how many mismatches we could resolve based on the counts of each number. The difference between the size of the group and the maximum number of matching elements gives the minimum Hamming distance for that group.

5. **Return Total Hamming Distance**: Finally, we sum these individual group distances to get the total minimum Hamming distance.

Here's the Python implementation following the LeetCode format:



```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(size)]
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            # Union by rank
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

class Solution:
    def minimumHammingDistance(self, source: List[int], target: List[int], allowedSwaps: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(source)

        # Step 1: Create union-find to manage connected components
        uf = UnionFind(n)

        # Step 2: Union the pairs from allowedSwaps
        for a, b in allowedSwaps:
            uf.union(a, b)

        # Step 3: Group elements by their root in the union-find structure
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        groups = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(n):
            root = uf.find(i)
            groups[root].append(i)

        # Step 4: Calculate Hamming distance
        min_hamming_distance = 0

        for indices in groups.values():
            # Collect source and target elements for this group
            source_count = defaultdict(int)
            target_count = defaultdict(int)
            
            for idx in indices:
                source_count[source[idx]] += 1
                target_count[target[idx]] += 1
            
            # Calculate how many can match
            matches = 0
            for value in source_count:
                if value in target_count:
                    matches += min(source_count[value], target_count[value])
            
            # The number of mismatches in this group is group size - matches
            min_hamming_distance += len(indices) - matches

        return min_hamming_distance

```

### Explanation of the code:

1. **UnionFind Class**: It implements the union-find structure with path compression in `find()` and union by rank in `union()` methods.

2. **minimumHammingDistance Function**:
   - We initialize a union-find structure with `n` elements.
   - We unify the indices based on the allowed swaps.
   - Using a defaultdict, we create groups of indices that can be transformed into the same values.
   - For each group, we count the occurrences of elements from both arrays and calculate how many can be matched.
   - The final Hamming distance is calculated by subtracting the matches from the total number of elements in the group and summing those values.

The function `minimumHammingDistance` finally returns the minimum possible Hamming distance after considering all allowed actions.
