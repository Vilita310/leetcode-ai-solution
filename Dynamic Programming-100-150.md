# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.


Example 1:
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is: start on cost[1], pay that cost, and go to the top.


Example 2:
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is: start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].


Constraints:
`2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
`0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to reach the top of a staircase given the costs for each step, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the minimum cost required to reach each step and build from there. 

### Explanation of the Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We'll use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum cost to reach step `i`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - We can start computing from the 0th and 1st step. 
   - The cost to step on the 0th step is simply `cost[0]`, and for the 1st step, it is `cost[1]`.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each step from the 2nd step onwards, the minimum cost to get to that step can be derived from the costs of the previous two steps:
   
     \[
     dp[i] = \text{cost}[i] + \min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
     \]

   This means that to get to step `i`, you can either come from step `i-1` or step `i-2`, and you will incur the cost of `cost[i]`.

4. **Base Case**: The minimum cost to reach the last step (which is effectively reaching the top of the floor, one step above the last step) will be the minimum between the costs to reach the last two steps.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, the result will be `min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])`, where `n` is the length of the cost array.

### Python Code

The following code implements the above logic and is compatible with LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(cost)
        
        # Create dp array to store the minimum cost to reach each step
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # dp[i] will hold the min cost to reach step i
        
        # Base cases
        dp[0] = 0  # No cost to stand at the ground
        dp[1] = cost[0]  # Cost to reach the first step (can only step on index 0)
        
        # Fill in the dp array using the recurrence relation
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = cost[i - 1] + min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2])
        
        # Return the cost to reach the top of the stair (beyond the last step)
        return min(dp[n], dp[n - 1])

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**: The code defines a class `Solution` which is the standard format for LeetCode problems.

2. **Function Definition**: `minCostClimbingStairs` takes a list `cost`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `dp` list is initialized to have a length of `n + 1` to handle the costs to reach steps including the "top".

4. **Base Case Handling**: We set the cost to stand on the ground and the first step accordingly.

5. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: We loop from step 2 up to `n`, filling out our `dp` array based on the defined recurrence relation.

6. **Result Calculation**: Lastly, we determine the minimum of reaching either of the last two steps as our result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of steps, as we only iterate through the steps once. The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) due to the additional `dp` array.

This solution should be efficient and adhere to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 750. Number Of Corner Rectangles

### Problem Description 
Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.


Example 1:
Input: grid = 
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].


Example 2:
Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.


Example 3:
Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.

Note:
The number of rows and columns of `grid` will each be in the range `[1, 200]`.

Each `grid[i][j]` will be either `0` or `1`.

The number of `1`s in the grid will be at most `6000`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting corner rectangles in a grid of binary values (0s and 1s), you can follow the logic of identifying pairs of 1s in the same row and then checking how many occurrences of these pairs exist in multiple rows. This approach ensures we can efficiently count distinct rectangles.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Structure**: A corner rectangle in this context is made up of four corners (1s) that form a rectangle within the grid. Hence, for every pair of 1s in one row, we can check how many rows beneath them have those two 1s in the same columns.

2. **Iterate Over Rows**: For each row, identify pairs of columns containing 1s. For each unique pair of 1s (columns), we will keep track of how many times this pair has been seen in rows above.

3. **Use a Dictionary to Count Pairs**: Utilize a dictionary to record the occurrence of each column pair. For every new pair found in subsequent rows, we can compute the number of rectangles that can be formed with previously observed pairs.

4. **Count Rectangles**: For every pair when a new pair (i.e., from the current row) is added to the dictionary, the number of new rectangles formed is equal to the count of previous occurrences of that pair. Update the final count accordingly.

5. **Complexity**: The algorithm efficiently runs in O(R * C^2) time complexity, where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns, but since we are only considering pairs, we combine the processing into manageable counts.

### Python Code

Now, let's put this explanation into the code format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countCornerRectangles(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row_count = len(grid)
        if row_count == 0:
            return 0
        
        col_count = len(grid[0])
        pair_count = {}
        rectangle_count = 0
        
        # Iterate through each row in the grid
        for row in grid:
            # Collect columns indices of 1s in the current row
            ones_indices = [j for j in range(col_count) if row[j] == 1]
            
            # Iterate over every pair of indices
            for i in range(len(ones_indices)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(ones_indices)):
                    pair = (ones_indices[i], ones_indices[j])
                    
                    # Update rectangle count based on the count of this pair seen previously
                    rectangle_count += pair_count.get(pair, 0)
                    
                    # Then increment the count of this pair for future rectangles
                    pair_count[pair] = pair_count.get(pair, 0) + 1
        
        return rectangle_count

```

### How to Use This Code

1. **Input**: The input for the `countCornerRectangles` method is a 2D list (`grid`) consisting of integers 0 and 1.
2. **Output**: The output will be an integer that represents the total number of distinct corner rectangles formed by 1s in the input grid.
3. **LeetCode Setup**: You can directly copy and paste this code block in the LeetCode editor after selecting the problem to test and run against provided test cases.

### Example Runs

- For input `[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]`, the output will be `1`.
- For `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]`, the output will be `9`.
- For `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]`, the output will be `0`.

This approach efficiently counts all distinct corner rectangles by utilizing combinations of 1s in the grid.

# 764. Largest Plus Sign

### Problem Description 
In a 2D `grid` from (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1), every cell contains a `1`, except those cells in the given list `mines` which are `0`.  What is the largest axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s contained in the grid?  Return the order of the plus sign.  If there is none, return 0.

An "axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s of order k" has some center `grid[x][y] = 1` along with 4 arms of length `k-1` going up, down, left, and right, and made of `1`s.  This is demonstrated in the diagrams below.  Note that there could be `0`s or `1`s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for 1s.


Examples of Axis-Aligned Plus Signs of Order k:Order 1:
000
010
000
Order 2:
00000
00100
01110
00100
00000
Order 3:
0000000
0001000
0001000
0111110
0001000
0001000
0000000

Example 1:Input: N = 5, mines = [[4, 2]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
11111
11111
11111
11111
11011
In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be order 2.  One of them is marked in bold.


Example 2:Input: N = 2, mines = []
Output: 1
Explanation:
There is no plus sign of order 2, but there is of order 1.


Example 3:Input: N = 1, mines = [[0, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There is no plus sign, so return 0.

Note:
`N` will be an integer in the range `[1, 500]`.

`mines` will have length at most `5000`.

`mines[i]` will be length 2 and consist of integers in the range `[0, N-1]`.

(Additionally, programs submitted in C, C++, or C# will be judged with a slightly smaller time limit.)

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the largest axis-aligned plus sign in a grid, we can use dynamic programming to effectively calculate the potential arms of plus signs for each cell in the grid. Let's break down the algorithm step by step, and ultimately, I will provide the code in a format suitable for LeetCode.

### Explanation of the Approach:
1. **Grid Initialization**: We will initialize a grid of size N x N filled with `1`s. We will then mark the cells defined in the `mines` list as `0` in order to identify where the plus signs cannot be centered.

2. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: We'll create four additional 2D lists to keep track of how many continuous `1`s we can find in each of the four directions (up, down, left, and right):
   - `up[i][j]`: Number of `1`s vertically upwards from position `(i, j)`.
   - `down[i][j]`: Number of `1`s vertically downwards from position `(i, j)`.
   - `left[i][j]`: Number of `1`s horizontally to the left of position `(i, j)`.
   - `right[i][j]`: Number of `1`s horizontally to the right of position `(i, j)`.

3. **Filling the DP Arrays**: We will iterate through the grid to fill in these arrays. For example, to compute `up[i][j]`, we will iterate from top to bottom and count how many consecutive `1`s we see.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Plus Sign Order**: For each cell, the potential order of a plus sign centered at that cell would be the smallest value among `up[i][j]`, `down[i][j]`, `left[i][j]`, and `right[i][j]`. We update the maximum plus sign order accordingly.

5. **Return Result**: After checking all cells, the maximum order found will be the answer to our problem.

### Implementation:

Here's the Python code formatted for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def orderOfLargestPlusSign(self, N: int, mines: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Initialize the grid
        grid = [[1] * N for _ in range(N)]
        
        # Step 2: Mark the mines
        for mine in mines:
            x, y = mine
            grid[x][y] = 0
        
        # Step 3: Initialize DP arrays
        up = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
        down = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
        left = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
        right = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
        
        # Step 4: Fill DP arrays
        # Up
        for j in range(N):
            for i in range(N):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    up[i][j] = (up[i-1][j] + 1) if i > 0 else 1
        
        # Down
        for j in range(N):
            for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    down[i][j] = (down[i+1][j] + 1) if i < N - 1 else 1
        
        # Left
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    left[i][j] = (left[i][j-1] + 1) if j > 0 else 1
        
        # Right
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    right[i][j] = (right[i][j+1] + 1) if j < N - 1 else 1
        
        # Step 5: Determine the largest order of plus sign
        max_order = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    max_order = max(max_order, min(up[i][j], down[i][j], left[i][j], right[i][j]))
        
        return max_order

```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), as we are iterating over the grid multiple times (for each DP array).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2), for storing the DP arrays.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints and correctly finds the largest plus sign of 1's in the provided grid.

# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

### Problem Description 
There are `n` cities connected by `m` flights. Each flight starts from city `u` and arrives at `v` with a price `w`.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city `src` and the destination `dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with up to `k` stops. If there is no such route, output `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
The cheapest price from city `0` to city `2` with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.


Example 2:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
The cheapest price from city `0` to city `2` with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.


Constraints:
The number of nodes `n` will be in range `[1, 100]`, with nodes labeled from `0` to `n`` - 1`.

The size of `flights` will be in range `[0, n * (n - 1) / 2]`.

The format of each flight will be `(src, ``dst``, price)`.

The price of each flight will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.

`k` is in the range of `[0, n - 1]`.

There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the cheapest flight from a source city to a destination city with a given number of stops, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm or a breadth-first search approach. Given the constraints of up to `n=100` cities and a maximum of `k` stops, a breadth-first search approach with priority queue (min-heap) fits very well.

Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

### Approach:
1. **Graph Representation:** We will represent the cities and flights as a graph using an adjacency list where each city points to a list of tuples representing its neighboring cities and the corresponding flight costs.

2. **Min-Heap for the Cheapest Costs:** We'll use a priority queue to explore the least-cost path first. This min-heap will keep track of the cost to reach each city along with the number of stops made so far.

3. **Breadth-First Search:** Starting from the source city, we will explore the flights. For each flight, if the destination city can still be reached with `k` stops or fewer, we will push the new cost and the incremented stop count back into the priority queue.

4. **Early Stopping:** If we reach the destination city, we can return the cost immediately if we use fewer than or equal to `k` stops. If we exhaust all possibilities without reaching the destination, we will return `-1`.

### Implementation:
Here is the code that follows this explanation:



```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create an adjacency list for storing flight information
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in flights:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the priority queue and add the starting city
        # The priority queue will hold tuples in the form: (cost, current_city, stops_remaining)
        pq = [(0, src, k + 1)]  # cost, start city, k + 1 for starting point
        while pq:
            cost, city, stops = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            # Step 3: If we reach the destination city, return the cost
            if city == dst:
                return cost
            
            # Step 4: If there are stops remaining, explore adjacent cities
            if stops > 0:
                for neighbor, price in graph[city]:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + price, neighbor, stops - 1))
        
        # If no route is found, return -1
        return -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Graph Creation:** We create the `graph` as a defaultdict of lists. Each entry `graph[u]` contains a list of tuples `(v, w)`, where `u` is the origin city, `v` is the destination city, and `w` is the price of the flight.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization:** We start our search from the `src` city with an initial cost of `0` and set `k + 1` as our initial stops allowed (to include the starting city itself).

3. **Main Loop:** We pop from the priority queue, examining the least costly option first. If this city is our destination, we return the cost. If we can still make stops, we explore all neighboring flights from this city, adding them to the priority queue with their cumulative cost and the decremented stop count.

4. **Return Result:** If we exhaust all options without reaching the destination, we return `-1`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(E log E), where E is the number of edges, due to each edge being processed and pushed into the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E) for the graph and the priority queue.

This implementation follows the constraints and requirements mentioned in the problem, and it can be run directly on the LeetCode platform.

# 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling

### Problem Description 
We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

XX  <- domino
XX  <- "L" tromino
X
Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
Note:
N  will be in range `[1, 1000]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of ways to tile a 2xN board with 2x1 dominoes and L-shaped trominoes, we can use dynamic programming. The key insight is to break down the problem based on the last tiles that are placed on the board. 

### Analysis
When considering how to tile a 2xN board:
1. If the last tile placed is a vertical domino:
   - The remaining space is a 2x(N-1) board.
   
2. If the last tile placed is a horizontal domino:
   - The remaining space is a 2x(N-2) board.

3. If the last tiles are an "L" tromino:
   - We can place the L-tromino in two orientations which each take up a 2x2 area:
     - By placing it in the left-bottom corner (occupying the bottom left and left of the top).
     - By placing it in the right-bottom corner (occupying two bottom positions and the adjacent top-left).
   - For the first case, the remaining space is a 2x(N-2) board.
   - For the second use of L-tromino, the remaining space is a 2x(N-3) board.

### Dynamic Programming Recurrence Relation
Based on the placements discussed, we can derive the following recurrence relation:
- `dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2] + 2 * dp[n-3]`
Where:
- `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to tile an empty board)
- `dp[1] = 1` (only one vertical domino)
- `dp[2] = 2` (either two vertical dominoes or two horizontal dominoes)
- `dp[3] = 5` (the five combinations as illustrated in the example)

### Implementation
Let’s implement this in Python following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, N: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Base cases
        if N == 0: return 1
        if N == 1: return 1
        if N == 2: return 2
        if N == 3: return 5

        # Dynamic programming array
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)
        dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], dp[3] = 1, 1, 2, 5
        
        for i in range(4, N + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 * dp[i-3]) % MOD
            
        return dp[N]

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Initialization**: We declare a MOD constant for handling large numbers due to modulo operations and initialize the base cases according to our analysis.

2. **DP Array**: A list named `dp` is created where `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to tile a 2xN board.

3. **Filling the DP Array**: We use a loop starting from `4` to `N` to fill in our dp array based on the recurrence relation.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return `dp[N]`, which will hold the number of ways to tile the 2xN board.

The complexity of this solution is O(N) in both time and space, which is efficient given the constraints. This code format can be directly run on the LeetCode platform.

# 799. Champagne Tower

### Problem Description 
We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has `1` glass, the second row has `2` glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)
For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the `jth` glass in the `ith` row is (both `i` and `j` are 0-indexed.)

Example 1:
Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.


Example 2:
Input: poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.50000
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.


Example 3:
Input: poured = 100000009, query_row = 33, query_glass = 17
Output: 1.00000

Constraints:
`0 <= poured <= 109`
`0 <= query_glass <= query_row < 100`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we will simulate the pouring of champagne into a pyramid of glasses. Our goal is to determine how full a specific glass in the pyramid is after `poured` cups of champagne are poured into the top glass.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Understanding the Pyramid Structure**:
   - The pyramid has rows indexed from `0` to `99`, where the `i-th` row contains `i + 1` glasses.
   - Each glass will hold at most `1` cup of champagne. If a glass exceeds `1` cup, the excess will spill over equally into the two glasses directly below it.

2. **Simulating the Pour**:
   - We'll initialize a two-dimensional list (or array) to represent the glasses. The dimensions will be `[100][100]`, corresponding to the maximum number of rows.
   - We start with pouring `poured` cups into the top glass (glass at row 0, index 0).
   - We iterate through each row and within each row, check each glass. If a glass has more than `1` cup, we distribute the excess equally to the two glasses below it.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - After simulating the pouring process, we simply return how full the specified glass is by accessing the value in our 2D list.

Now, here’s the complete Python code following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def champagneTower(self, poured: int, query_row: int, query_glass: int) -> float:
        # Create a 2D array to represent the glasses in the pyramid
        glasses = [[0.0] * (i + 1) for i in range(100)]
        
        # Pour champagne into the top glass
        glasses[0][0] = poured
        
        # Iterate through each row of glasses
        for i in range(100):
            for j in range(i + 1):  # Only go up to the current row
                # If the current glass has more than 1 cup, distribute overflow
                if glasses[i][j] > 1.0:
                    overflow = glasses[i][j] - 1.0
                    glasses[i][j] = 1.0  # Cap the glass at 1.0
                    
                    # Distribute overflow to below glasses (i+1 row)
                    if i < 99:  # Ensure we don't exceed row limits
                        glasses[i + 1][j] += overflow / 2  # Left glass
                        glasses[i + 1][j + 1] += overflow / 2  # Right glass
        
        # Return the amount in the queried glass, capped at 1
        return min(1.0, glasses[query_row][query_glass])

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the class `Solution` with the function `champagneTower` which takes in the number of cups poured, and the indices of the glass we want to check.
- We initialize a 2D list `glasses` where each element signifies how full each glass is. 
- We begin pouring by setting the first glass's value to `poured`.
- We then iterate through each glass and check if it has more than `1`. If it does, we calculate the overflow and distribute it to the two glasses below it.
- Finally, we return the value of the glass located at `[query_row][query_glass]`, ensuring it does not exceed `1.0` using `min()` function. 

This implementation efficiently simulates the pouring process without excessive memory consumption, and it works within the constraints given, providing the correct result for each test case.

# 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

### Problem Description 
We have two integer sequences `A` and `B` of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements `A[i]` and `B[i]`.  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, `A` and `B` are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if `A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1]`.)
Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.


Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.

Note:
`A, B` are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

`A[i], B[i]` are integer values in the range `[0, 2000]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of making two sequences strictly increasing with the minimum number of swaps, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain two states for each index `i` indicating whether we have included the current elements of sequences `A` and `B` as is or swapped them. 

### Approach:

1. **States Representation**:
   - Use two variables `keep` and `swap`:
     - `keep` - the minimum number of swaps needed to make both sequences strictly increasing up to index `i` without swapping the `i`-th elements.
     - `swap` - the minimum number of swaps needed to make both sequences strictly increasing up to index `i` with swapped `i`-th elements.

2. **DP Transitions**:
   - If we do not swap the elements at index `i`, then:
     - `keep` will be valid if `A[i] > A[i-1]` and `B[i] > B[i-1]`.
     - `swap` will be valid if we swapped the elements at `i-1`, i.e. `B[i-1] < A[i]` and `A[i-1] < B[i]`.
   - If we swap the elements at index `i`, then similarly check the conditions for `keep` and `swap` based on whether we swapped at `i-1` or not.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Start both `keep` and `swap` at 0 for the first index, since no swaps are needed initially, as that's the base case.

4. **Iterate through the arrays**:
   - For each index from 1 to len(A)-1, update `keep` and `swap` based on the above conditions.

5. **Return the minimum swaps needed**:
   - At the end, the result will be the minimum of `keep` and `swap` after processing all indices.

### Implementation:

Here's how you can implement this solution in Python, following the LeetCode submission format:



```python
class Solution:
    def minSwap(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(A)
        # Initialize the dp arrays
        keep, swap = 0, 1  # Initially keep for first index (0 swaps), swap (1 swap)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Start with large values for the new keep and swap
            new_keep, new_swap = float('inf'), float('inf')
            
            # Check conditions for not swapping (keep)
            if A[i] > A[i - 1] and B[i] > B[i - 1]:
                new_keep = min(new_keep, keep)  # Continue keeping
                
            if A[i] > B[i - 1] and B[i] > A[i - 1]:
                new_keep = min(new_keep, swap)  # Previous swapped, now not swapping
                
            # Check conditions for swapping (swap)
            if A[i] > A[i - 1] and B[i] > B[i - 1]:
                new_swap = min(new_swap, swap + 1)  # Continuing swap will incur a swap
                
            if A[i] > B[i - 1] and B[i] > A[i - 1]:
                new_swap = min(new_swap, keep + 1)  # Previous was keep and now swapping

            keep, swap = new_keep, new_swap
        
        return min(keep, swap)

```

### Explanation:
- We use two variables `keep` and `swap` to represent our ongoing minimum swaps at each consideration.
- We iterate through the indices and update the `keep` and `swap` values based on whether we can maintain or change the state (swap).
- At the end of the iterations, we simply take the minimum of `keep` and `swap` to provide the result. 

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), which is optimal given the constraints.

# 808. Soup Servings

### Problem Description 
There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially we have `N` ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:
Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B
Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B
Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B
Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B
When we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.  Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can.  We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.  
Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.


Example:
Input: N = 50
Output: 0.625
Explanation: 
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

Notes: 
`0 <= N <= 10^9`. 
Answers within `10^-6` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of serving soups A and B while calculating the probabilities of which soup runs out first, we'll utilize dynamic programming, memoization, and the recursive structure of the problem. Given the constraints (0 <= N <= 10^9), a direct simulation of all soup servings would be infeasible, so we will use memoization to store already computed states.

Here's the detailed explanation of the algorithm and how we would implement it in Python:

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Understanding Operations**: We have four operations, each affects the amounts of soup A and B differently:
   - Serve 100 ml of A, 0 ml of B
   - Serve 75 ml of A, 25 ml of B
   - Serve 50 ml of A, 50 ml of B
   - Serve 25 ml of A, 75 ml of B
2. **Stopping Condition**: We stop when either type A or type B is empty. If both A and B run out simultaneously, it counts differently in our probability calculations.
3. **Recursive Approach**: We'll use a recursive function to calculate the outcome probabilities based on the current volumes of A and B, leveraging memoization to store computed results for specific states.

### Probability Calculation
- The probability of A being emptied first given current amounts of A (a) and B (b) can be computed as:
  

```python
  P(a, b) = (1/4) * P(a - 100, b) + (1/4) * P(a - 75, b - 25) + (1/4) * P(a - 50, b - 50) + (1/4) * P(a - 25, b - 75)
  
```
- We must also handle edge cases:
  - If A is empty and B is not, return 1 (A is empty first).
  - If B is empty and A is not, return 0 (B is empty first).
  - If both A and B are empty at the same time, return 0.5 (counts for half).

### Implementation
Here is the complete implementation of the above logic in the format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def soupServings(self, N: int) -> float:
        # Edge case when N is 0
        if N == 0:
            return 0.5
        
        # Memoization dictionary
        memo = {}
        
        # Recursive function to calculate the probability
        def helper(a, b):
            # Check if we've already computed this state
            if (a, b) in memo:
                return memo[(a, b)]
            
            # Base cases
            if a <= 0 and b <= 0:
                return 0.5
            if a <= 0:
                return 1.0
            if b <= 0:
                return 0.0
            
            # Calculate probability from all four operations
            prob = 0.25 * (helper(a - 100, b) + 
                           helper(a - 75, b - 25) +
                           helper(a - 50, b - 50) +
                           helper(a - 25, b - 75))
            
            # Store in memo dictionary
            memo[(a, b)] = prob
            return prob
    
        # Call helper function with the initial state
        return helper(N, N)

```

### Explanation of Code
- We define a nested function `helper(a, b)` for the probability calculations.
- We use a dictionary `memo` to store already computed probabilities for particular amounts of soup A and B.
- The recursive function checks for base cases where one or both soups are empty and returns the respective probabilities.
- The probabilities are accumulated based on the four operations, and the result is stored in the memoization dictionary to avoid recalculating.
- Finally, we call the `helper` function starting from the initial amounts of A and B, which both begin at N ml.

This implementation will efficiently compute the desired probability with memoization, allowing it to handle large values of `N` within the constraints specified.

# 813. Largest Sum of Averages

### Problem Description 
We partition a row of numbers `A` into at most `K` adjacent (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?
Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.


Example:
Input: 
A = [9,1,2,3,9]
K = 3
Output: 20
Explanation: 
The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.

We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.

That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.

Note: 
`1 <= A.length <= 100`.

`1 <= A[i] <= 10000`.

`1 <= K <= A.length`.

Answers within `10^-6` of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to maximize the score by partitioning the array `A` into up to `K` groups. The approach involves using a DP table to store the maximum scores for different partitions and a second array to store cumulative sums, which will help in calculating the averages efficiently.

### Steps to solve the problem:

1. **Initialize the DP table**: Create a 2D DP table `dp[k][n]` where `k` represents the number of groups and `n` represents the first `n` elements of the array `A`. The value at `dp[k][n]` will store the maximum score we can achieve using the first `n` elements of `A` with `k` partitions.

2. **Cumulative Sums**: Maintain a cumulative sum array to calculate the sum of any segment of the array efficiently, which will help in calculating the average quickly.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each possible count of groups `k` from `1` to `K` and for each segment of the array ending at `n`, compute the maximum score by considering various possible last group sizes.
   - For each potential last group starting from some index `j` to `n`, calculate the average of the elements between index `j` and `n`. The score will be computed as the average of these elements added to the best score obtained from the previous groups (`dp[k-1][j-1]`).

4. **Final Result**: The result will be located in `dp[K][len(A)]`, which will give us the maximum score using the entire array with at most K partitions.

### Python Code Implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def largestSumOfAverages(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> float:
        N = len(A)
        # Cumulative sum array
        cumulative_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            cumulative_sum[i] = cumulative_sum[i - 1] + A[i - 1]

        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for k in range(1, K + 1):
            for n in range(1, N + 1):
                # Try every possible last group
                for j in range(n):
                    # Calculate the sum of the segment A[j:n]
                    total = cumulative_sum[n] - cumulative_sum[j]
                    average = total / (n - j)  # Average of the last group
                    dp[k][n] = max(dp[k][n], dp[k-1][j] + average)

        return dp[K][N]

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# result = sol.largestSumOfAverages([9,1,2,3,9], 3)
# print(result)  # Output: 20.0

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Cumulative Sum**: We compute a cumulative sum array to make it easy to compute any range's sum in constant time.
  
- **DP Table Initialization**: We create a 2D list `dp` of dimensions `(K+1) x (N+1)`. This table is filled gradually for each possible number of groups `k` and the first `n` elements of `A`.

- **Filling DP Table**: For each combination of `k` groups and the first `n` elements, we check every possible starting point `j` for the last group and calculate the maximum possible score at `dp[k][n]`.

- **Return Value**: Finally, we return the best score using all numbers up to `K` groups, which is found at `dp[K][N]`.

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: \(O(K \times N^2)\)
- Space Complexity: \(O(K \times N)\)

This code adheres to the LeetCode solution format and should run directly on the LeetCode platform. The constraints given ensure this approach is efficient within the specified limits.

# 818. Race Car

### Problem Description 
Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go into negative positions.)
Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).

When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: `position += speed, speed *= 2`.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then `speed = -1` , otherwise `speed = 1`.  (Your position stays the same.)
For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.

Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.


Example 1:
Input: 
target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".

Your position goes from 0->1->3.


Example 2:
Input: 
target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".

Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.

Note: 
`1 <= target <= 10000`.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to explore all possible sequences of instructions that lead us to a target position. At each state, we can either choose to accelerate or reverse, allowing us to keep track of our current position and speed.

### Key Details:
1. **Position & Speed**: The position starts at 0, and the speed starts at +1. The speed can increase when you accelerate or change in direction when you reverse.
2. **Instruction Logic**:
   - "A" (Accelerate): Move to `position += speed` and double the speed (`speed *= 2`).
   - "R" (Reverse): If the speed is positive, change it to -1, otherwise set it to 1 (the position remains unchanged).
3. **BFS Exploration**: Use a queue to explore each potential state as we execute instructions. We can store tuples of (position, speed, instruction_count) in the queue to keep track of our progression.
4. **Visited States**: We maintain a set of visited states to prevent processing the same position and speed combination multiple times.
5. **Target**: We stop the exploration once we reach the target position.

Here’s the implementation of the above logic, following the LeetCode format:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestInstructions(self, target: int) -> int:
        # Use BFS
        queue = deque()
        queue.append((0, 1, 0))  # (position, speed, instruction_count)
        visited = set()
        visited.add((0, 1))  # Initial state
        
        while queue:
            position, speed, instruction_count = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if we've reached the target
            if position == target:
                return instruction_count
            
            # Option 1: Accelerate
            new_position = position + speed
            new_speed = speed * 2
            if (new_position, new_speed) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_position, new_speed))
                queue.append((new_position, new_speed, instruction_count + 1))
            
            # Option 2: Reverse
            new_position = position
            new_speed = -1 if speed > 0 else 1
            if (new_position, new_speed) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_position, new_speed))
                queue.append((new_position, new_speed, instruction_count + 1))
        
        return -1  # In case no solution found (should not happen given constraints)

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.shortestInstructions(3))  # Output: 2
print(solution.shortestInstructions(6))  # Output: 5

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Queue Initialization**: We start our BFS with the initial state (position = 0, speed = 1, instruction_count = 0).
- **Main Loop**: While there are states to explore in the queue, we:
    - Dequeue the current state.
    - Check if the current position matches the target. If it does, return the instruction_count.
    - Explore two options: accelerate and reverse.
        - For acceleration, compute the new position and new speed, and check if they have been visited.
        - For reversing, simply modify the speed (not changing the position) and check for visitation.
- **Visited Tracking**: We use a set to keep track of (position, speed) pairs we have already processed, which helps avoid loops and redundant calculations.

By executing this BFS algorithm, we efficiently find the shortest sequence of instructions required to reach the specified target.

# 837. New 21 Game

### Problem Description 
Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while she has less than `K` points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, W]`, where `W` is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points.  What is the probability that she has `N` or less points?

Example 1:
Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.


Example 2:
Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.

In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.


Example 3:
Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278
Note:
`0 <= K <= N <= 10000`
`1 <= W <= 10000`
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.

The judging time limit has been reduced for this question.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the probability that Alice has `N` or less points when she stops drawing, we can utilize dynamic programming. We'll create a DP array where `dp[x]` represents the probability that Alice ends up with exactly `x` points after drawing cards.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a DP array initialized with zeros and set `dp[0] = 1.0`, as Alice starts with 0 points and has a 100% probability of starting with that score.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each possible score from `1` to `N`, calculate the probability `dp[x]` that Alice ends up with `x` points using the following logic:
     - Alice can reach `x` from any of the previous `1` to `W` points drawn. Specifically, if Alice drew a number `draw` (where `1 <= draw <= W`), she must have had `x - draw` points before the draw.
     - The contribution to `dp[x]` from `dp[x - draw]` happens if `x - draw >= 0`.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - We consider the cases where Alice cannot exceed `K - 1` points.
   - For scores beyond `K`, we simply set the probability as `0` since drawing more cards is not allowed if she has `K` points or more.

4. **Summing the Probabilities**:
   - Finally, sum up the probabilities from `dp[0]` to `dp[N]` to get the total probability that Alice ends up with `N` or less points.

Here's the Python code that follows the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProbability(self, N: int, K: int, W: int) -> float:
        # Probability DP array to store the probability of reaching each score
        dp = [0.0] * (N + 1)
        dp[0] = 1.0  # Starting point
        
        for i in range(1, K + W):  # Loop until we potentially exceed K
            new_dp = [0.0] * (N + 1)
            for x in range(max(0, i - W), min(N, i) + 1):
                # Sum probabilities from dp[x - 1] to dp[x - W] where valid
                for draw in range(1, W + 1):
                    if x - draw >= 0:
                        new_dp[x] += dp[x - draw] / W
            
            dp = new_dp
        
        # Sum probabilities for scores <= N
        return sum(dp[:N + 1])  # Return the total probability for scoring ≤ N

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization (`dp`)**: We create a list `dp` of length `N + 1` initialized to `0.0` to store probabilities. We set `dp[0] = 1.0` since there's a 100% chance Alice starts with `0` points.
   
2. **Looping through potential outcomes**: We iterate over possible total scores (`i`) from `1` to `K + W` to account for the maximum possible draws.

3. **Calculating probabilities**: For each score `x`, we look back at possible draws (`draw`) from `1` to `W` and update the new DP array.

4. **Final summation**: After populating the probabilities, we sum the values in `dp` up to `N` to find the desired probability.

This solution efficiently computes the probabilities using dynamic programming principles and ensures we stay within performance limits.

# 838. Push Dominoes

### Problem Description 
There are `N` dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright.

In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left.

Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.

When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.

For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

Given a string "S" representing the initial state. `S[i] = 'L'`, if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left; `S[i] = 'R'`, if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right; `S[i] = '.'`, if the `i`-th domino has not been pushed.

Return a string representing the final state. 

Example 1:
Input: ".L.R...LR..L.."
Output: "LL.RR.LLRRLL.."

Example 2:
Input: "RR.L"
Output: "RR.L"
Explanation: The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino.

Note:
`0 <= N <= 10^5`
String `dominoes` contains only `'L`', `'R'` and `'.'`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the final state of the dominoes after they are pushed, we will use a simulation approach. The basic idea is to track the effect of the forces exerted by 'R' (R falling right) and 'L' (L falling left) on the adjacent dominoes represented by '.'.

### Steps to Approach the Problem

1. **Initialize an Array**: Convert the string into a list so we can easily modify the states of the dominoes.

2. **Use Two Passes**:
    - **First Pass (Right to Left)**: Traverse the array from left to right. Keep track of the number of consecutive 'R' characters. When an 'L' is encountered, determine how many 'R's were before it to see how they affect the domino falling to the left.
    - **Second Pass (Left to Right)**: Traverse the array from right to left. This time, keep track of the number of consecutive 'L's. When an 'R' is encountered, determine how many 'L's follow it to see how they affect the domino falling to the right.

3. **Determine Final States**: After both passes, update the states of dominoes based on the counts retrieved from both passes.

### Implementation



```python
class Solution:
    def pushDominoes(self, dominoes: str) -> str:
        n = len(dominoes)
        # Convert the input string to a list for easy manipulation
        dominoes = list(dominoes)

        # First pass: handle 'R' forcing dominoes to the right
        force = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if dominoes[i] == 'R':
                force = n  # set a large force when we see an 'R'
            elif dominoes[i] == 'L':
                force = 0  # reset force when we see an 'L'
            else:
                force = max(0, force - 1)  # reduce the force over position
                if force > 0:
                    dominoes[i] = 'R'  # set the domino to 'R' if force is still positive

        # Second pass: handle 'L' forcing dominoes to the left
        force = 0
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if dominoes[i] == 'L':
                force = n  # set a large force when we see an 'L'
            elif dominoes[i] == 'R':
                force = 0  # reset force when we see an 'R'
            else:
                force = max(0, force - 1)  # reduce the force over position
                if force > 0:
                    dominoes[i] = 'L'  # set the domino to 'L' if force is still positive

        # Convert the list back to string and return the result
        return ''.join(dominoes)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# result = sol.pushDominoes(".L.R...LR..L..")
# print(result)  # Expected output: "LL.RR.LLRRLL.."

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: We first create a list from the input string to allow for mutable operations.

- **First Pass**:
  - We iterate over the array. When an 'R' is encountered, we define a strong force (set to a large number, here `n`).
  - If 'L' appears, we reset any force back to zero, as it pushes the situation back. If we see '.', we check if there is still a positive force, and if so, we set that domino to 'R'.

- **Second Pass**:
  - This is similar but we traverse backwards. Again, we reset the force when we see an 'R' and apply forces for 'L' similarly. If we see '.', we set it to 'L' if the left force is still positive.

- **Final Conversion**: Finally, we convert the list back to a string and return it.

This approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for the input constraint \(0 \leq N \leq 10^5\).

# 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes

### Problem Description 
An undirected, connected graph of N nodes (labeled `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`) is given as `graph`.

`graph.length = N`, and `j != i` is in the list `graph[i]` exactly once, if and only if nodes `i` and `j` are connected.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.


Example 1:
Input: [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]

Example 2:
Input: [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
Note:
`1 <= graph.length <= 12`
`0 <= graph[i].length < graph.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the shortest path that visits every node in an undirected, connected graph, we can utilize a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dynamic Programming with bitmasks. The goal is to explore all possible paths and keep track of visited nodes to ensure we find the shortest path that covers all nodes.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` contains a list of nodes connected to node `i`.

2. **Bitmasking**: We will represent the set of visited nodes using bitmasks. If there are `N` nodes, a bitmask `mask` of length `N` indicates which nodes have been visited. The `k`-th bit in `mask` is `1` if node `k` has been visited.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We define a DP table `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` indicates the visited nodes and `i` indicates the current node. This table will store the minimum number of edges used to reach the state defined by `mask` and node `i`.

4. **BFS/DFS for Path Exploration**: We will initiate paths from each node and explore all paths until all nodes are visited.

### Steps for the Solution

1. Create a DP table initialized to infinity (or a large number), except for the starting positions (where only one bit is set).
2. For each state in the DP table, explore all edges from the current node.
3. Update the states in the DP table based on the new visited nodes and current position.
4. Finally, calculate the minimum distance for any combination of visited nodes that includes all nodes.

Here's the complete Python code that follows the LeetCode submission format:



```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPathLength(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        from collections import deque
        
        N = len(graph)
        # Edge case: If there's only one node, return 0
        if N == 1:
            return 0

        # DP table to store minimum distances
        dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(1 << N)]
        # Starting from each node
        for i in range(N):
            dp[1 << i][i] = 0

        # Iterate through all possible masks
        for mask in range(1 << N):
            for u in range(N):
                # If current state is not reachable
                if dp[mask][u] == float('inf'):
                    continue
                # Traverse all neighbors of u
                for v in graph[u]:
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << v)
                    dp[new_mask][v] = min(dp[new_mask][v], dp[mask][u] + 1)

        # The final state we want to reach is all nodes visited
        final_mask = (1 << N) - 1
        # Find the minimum in the final state
        return min(dp[final_mask][i] for i in range(N))


```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: 
    - We define the number of nodes `N` and initialize `dp` with size `1 << N (2^N)` x `N`, filling it with infinity. Starting conditions are set for single node states.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - We iterate through all possible masks (0 to `2^N - 1`) to explore all combinations of visited nodes. For each node `u` in this mask, we check its neighbors and update the DP state if we can reach them with fewer edges.

3. **Final Calculation**:
    - We calculate `final_mask` which represents all nodes visited. The result is the minimum number of edges used to reach any node from this final state.

### Conclusion

This approach effectively combines dynamic programming with bitmasking to solve the problem within reasonable time limits since `N` is limited to 12, making the bitmask space manageable. The solution efficiently computes the shortest path that visits every node in the graph, handling multiple starting points and graph structures seamlessly.

# 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops

### Problem Description 
A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each `station[i]` represents a gas station that is `station[i][0]` miles east of the starting position, and has `station[i][1]` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.


Example 1:
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.


Example 2:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).


Example 3:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We start with 10 liters of fuel.

We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.

Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.

We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

Note:
`1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9`
`0 <= stations.length <= 500`
`0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] < target`

### Solution 
 Sure! Below is the Python code that solves the problem as described. We'll be using a greedy approach combined with a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the refuel options at the gas stations we encounter along the way. 

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of refueling stops required for a car to reach a specific destination, given the initial fuel and a list of gas stations along the route. Each station has a certain amount of fuel available.

2. **Plan**:
    - Starting with `startFuel`, simulate the journey towards the `target`.
    - Keep track of the gas stations crossed and their fuel capacities. Use a max-heap (priority queue) to store the fuel available at stations we've passed that could be used for refueling.
    - If at any point we run out of fuel before reaching the next station or the destination, we'll check the max-heap to see if we can refuel from one of the previously crossed gas stations.
    - We'll repeat this process until we either reach the target or determine that it is impossible.

3. **Implementation**:
    - First, we'll add the destination as a "station" with 0 fuel at the end of the list for easier logic.
    - Use a heap to store fuel capacities only from gas stations that we can reach with the fuel available.
    - For each station, check if we can reach it with the current fuel; if not and the heap isn't empty, use the maximum fuel from the heap to refuel until we can move forward again or determine it's impossible.

Here's the implementation of the plan:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Add the target as a station with 0 fuel
        stations.append([target, 0])
        
        # Initialize variables
        max_heap = []
        current_fuel = startFuel
        last_position = 0
        refuels = 0
        
        for position, fuel in stations:
            current_fuel -= (position - last_position)
            
            while current_fuel < 0 and max_heap:
                # Refuel with the largest available fuel from heap
                current_fuel += -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                refuels += 1
            
            if current_fuel < 0:
                return -1
            
            # Add the fuel available at this station to the heap
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -fuel)
            last_position = position
            
        return refuels

```

### Explanation of Code:
- We start by appending a terminal station (target) to our list of stations.
- A priority queue (max-heap) is utilized to keep track of the available fuel capacities from stations we have passed.
- As we iterate through each station:
  1. Calculate the fuel consumed to reach the current station.
  2. If the current fuel falls below zero:
     - We check our max-heap for any previously passed gas stations and take the maximum fuel available until we either have enough fuel or run out of stations to refuel from.
  3. If we still can't proceed after all available refuels, we return `-1`.
  4. If we successfully refuel, we update the last position to the current station's position and continue.
- Finally, we return the total number of refueling stops made.

### Edge Cases:
- If the target is within initial fuel capacity, the code handles this by returning `0` directly since no refueling is necessary.
- The algorithm ensures efficiency given the constraints using a priority queue and appropriate checks.

With this structure, the code is ready to be run directly on LeetCode and follows the expected function signature.

# 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence

### Problem Description 
A sequence `X1, X2, ..., Xn` is Fibonacci-like if:
`n >= 3`
`Xi + Xi+1 = Xi+2` for all `i + 2 <= n`
Given a strictly increasing array `arr` of positive integers forming a sequence, return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return `0`.

A subsequence is derived from another sequence `arr` by deleting any number of elements (including none) from `arr`, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3, 5, 8]` is a subsequence of `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].


Constraints:
`3 <= arr.length <= 1000`
`1 <= arr[i] < arr[i + 1] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence from a given strictly increasing array of positive integers, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach along with two pointers to efficiently build our solution.

### Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci-like Sequence**: 
   A Fibonacci-like sequence is defined by the condition that for any three consecutive elements \( X_i, X_{i+1}, X_{i+2} \), the condition \( X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2} \) must hold.

2. **Using Hashing for Fast Index Lookup**:
   We will use a dictionary (hashtable) to store the indices of elements in the array. This allows for quick lookups to check if a required element exists.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   We will also maintain a 2D array `dp` where \( dp[j][i] \) indicates the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence ending with numbers `arr[j]` and `arr[i]` (with `j < i`).

4. **Two-Layer Loop**:
   We will loop through each pair of elements \( (arr[j], arr[i]) \), and for each pair, we will calculate the required preceding element \( X = arr[i] - arr[j] \). If \( X \) exists earlier in the array (using our dictionary), we can extend the Fibonacci-like sequence and update our `dp` table.

5. **Result Extraction**:
   After filling the `dp` table, we will search for the maximum value in this table. If the maximum value is less than 3, it means a valid Fibonacci-like subsequence was not found.

### Implementation:
Now, let's implement it in Python following the LeetCode solution structure:



```python
class Solution:
    def lenLongestFibSubseq(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        index_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(arr)}
        n = len(arr)
        dp = {}
        max_length = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                x = arr[i] - arr[j]  # This is the number we want to find
                if x in index_map and index_map[x] < j:  # x should exist and its index should be less than j
                    k = index_map[x]
                    # Update the length of the sequence [arr[k], arr[j], arr[i]]
                    dp[j, i] = dp.get((k, j), 2) + 1
                    max_length = max(max_length, dp[j, i])
        
        return max_length if max_length >= 3 else 0

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Dictionary Creation**: We create a dictionary `index_map` to store the indices of each number for O(1) lookups.
- **Double Loop**: The outer loop iterates through each ending element `arr[i]`, while the inner loop iterates through all previous elements `arr[j]`. For each pair, we compute the required preceding number \( arr[i] - arr[j] \).
- **DP Update**: If the required number exists at a valid index \( k \), we update our `dp` dictionary for sequence length.
- **Finding the Maximum**: Finally, we check the maximum sequence length found. We return this length if it's at least 3, otherwise, we return 0.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) due to the double loop, and it works well within the provided constraints for `arr`.

# 877. Stone Game

### Problem Description 
Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return `True` if and only if Alex wins the game.


Example 1:
Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.

Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].

If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.

If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.

This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.


Constraints:
`2 <= piles.length <= 500`
`piles.length` is even.

`1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
`sum(piles)` is odd.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem where Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones, we can use dynamic programming. The main idea is to track and calculate the optimal moves for both players. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding

1. **Objective**: Alex wants to maximize his score by either picking from the front or the back of the pile. Meanwhile, Lee will also play optimally to minimize Alex's score.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will create a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum number of stones Alex can guarantee to collect from the subarray `piles[i]` to `piles[j]`.

3. **Transition**: If Alex picks the pile `i`, Lee will optimally leave Alex with the subarray `piles[i+1]` to `piles[j]`. If Alex picks pile `j`, Lee will leave Alex with `piles[i]` to `piles[j-1]`. Hence, the transition can be defined as:
   - When Alex picks `piles[i]`: 
     - Stones collected: `piles[i] + (total stones from piles[i+1] to piles[j] - dp[i+1][j])`
   - When Alex picks `piles[j]`: 
     - Stones collected: `piles[j] + (total stones from piles[i] to piles[j-1] - dp[i][j-1])`
   Thus,
   \[
   dp[i][j] = \max(piles[i] + (sum(i+1, j) - dp[i+1][j]), piles[j] + (sum(i, j-1) - dp[i][j-1]))
   \]
   where `sum(i, j)` is the sum of the piles from index `i` to `j`.

4. **Base Case**: When there is only one pile left, `dp[i][i]` should simply be `piles[i]`, because Alex will take that pile.

### Implementation

Here’s how to implement the above logic in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGame(self, piles: list[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(piles)
        
        # Create a DP table initialized to 0
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Base case: when there's only one pile left, Alex can take it
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = piles[i]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the range we are evaluating
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                # The total number of stones from piles[i] to piles[j]
                total_stones = sum(piles[i:j + 1])
                dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] + (total_stones - piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j]),
                               piles[j] + (total_stones - piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1]))
        
        # Compare Alex's score with the sum of piles
        return dp[0][n - 1] > sum(piles) / 2

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum stones Alex can collect for all subranges of the piles.
- Populate the diagonal of `dp` with the values of the piles since if there's only one pile at that index, Alex will take it.
- We then iterate through lengths of the piles that we are considering, and for each subrange, we compute the optimal strategy for Alex.
- Finally, we check if the stones Alex can guarantee are more than half of the total stones.

This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested iterations over the DP table. Since the problem constraints are manageable, this solution is efficient and works well within the limits.

# 879. Profitable Schemes

### Problem Description 
There is a group of `n` members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The `ith` crime generates a `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least `minProfit` profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most `n`.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.

In total, there are 2 schemes.


Example 2:
Input: n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.

There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 100`
`0 <= minProfit <= 100`
`1 <= group.length <= 100`
`1 <= group[i] <= 100`
`profit.length == group.length`
`0 <= profit[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of profitable schemes that can be formed by committing crimes with given constraints, we can utilize dynamic programming. The approach will involve building a DP table that keeps track of the number of schemes that can be formed for given member counts and profit levels.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Parameters**:
   - `n`: Maximum number of members that can participate.
   - `minProfit`: Minimum profit that must be generated from the selected crimes.
   - `group[i]`: Number of members required for the `i-th` crime.
   - `profit[i]`: Profit generated by the `i-th` crime.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Create a DP table named `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a profit of `j` using exactly `i` members.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`, which denotes that there is one way to achieve a profit of `0` with `0` members (i.e., not engaging in any crime).

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through each crime. For each crime, check how many members and profit it offers.
   - Update the DP table from the back (i.e., from the maximum number of members down to the number of members required for the current crime) to prevent overwriting results that are required in the same iteration.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - Finally, sum up all the ways to achieve at least `minProfit`, considering all possible member counts from `0` to `n`.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since results can be very large, we will apply modulo `10^9 + 7` to the results during calculations.

### Implementation:

Below is the complete implementation that can be directly run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def profitableSchemes(self, n: int, minProfit: int, group: List[int], profit: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        numCrimes = len(group)

        # Initialize dp array
        # dp[i][j] – number of ways to achieve exactly j profit using i members
        dp = [[0] * (minProfit + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case
        
        for i in range(numCrimes):
            g = group[i]
            p = profit[i]
            # Traverse backwards to avoid overwriting previous state
            for mem in range(n, g - 1, -1):
                for prof in range(minProfit, -1, -1):
                    new_profit = min(minProfit, prof + p)  # No profit should exceed minProfit
                    dp[mem][new_profit] = (dp[mem][new_profit] + dp[mem - g][prof]) % MOD

        # Calculate the total schemes that have at least minProfit
        result = 0
        for mem in range(n + 1):
            for prof in range(minProfit, len(dp[mem])):
                result = (result + dp[mem][prof]) % MOD
                
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We initialize the DP table `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (minProfit + 1)`.
- We then fill this table by iterating over each crime and updating possible member counts and profits.
- The outer loops iterate over each crime, and the inner loops prioritize the profit calculations from the back to ensure previous states are preserved.
- Finally, we accumulate all the valid schemes that achieve at least `minProfit`, which gives us our answer.

This solution efficiently utilizes dynamic programming to solve the problem within the constraints provided.

# 887. Super Egg Drop

### Problem Description 
You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than `f` will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor `f` will not break.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of `f` is.


Example 1:
Input: k = 1, n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.

Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.

If it does not break, then we know f = 2.

Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.


Example 2:
Input: k = 2, n = 6
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: k = 3, n = 14
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= 100`
`1 <= n <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of moves required to find the critical floor using `k` eggs and a building with `n` floors, we can employ a dynamic programming approach.

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a DP table `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of moves needed to find the critical floor with `i` eggs and `j` floors.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `j == 0` (0 floors), we need 0 moves: `dp[i][0] = 0`.
   - If `j == 1` (1 floor), we need 1 move: `dp[i][1] = 1`.
   - If `i == 1` (1 egg), we need `j` moves because we have to drop from each floor starting from 1 to `j`: `dp[1][j] = j`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: For each combination of `i` and `j`, we need to consider dropping an egg from each floor `x` (from 1 to `j`). When we drop from floor `x`:
   - If the egg breaks, we have `i-1` eggs left and need to check the floors below `x` (which are `x-1` floors): `dp[i-1][x-1]`.
   - If the egg does not break, we still have `i` eggs and need to check the floors above `x` (which are `j-x` floors): `dp[i][j-x]`.
   
   We want to find the worst-case scenario (the maximum of the two outcomes) and minimize the maximum number of moves needed by varying the drop floor `x`.

4. **Optimizing the Floor Choice**: Instead of checking every floor directly, we can use a binary search approach to find the optimal floor to drop from, which reduces the complexity significantly.

5. **Final Result**: The answer is found in `dp[k][n]`.

### Implementation

Here is the Python code according to the specified structure suitable for execution on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def superEggDrop(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Create a DP table with (k+1) rows and (n+1) columns
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
        
        # Base cases initialization
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[1][j] = j  # 1 egg, j floors: j tries
        
        # Iterate over the number of eggs
        for i in range(2, k + 1):
            # Initialize for binary search
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                lo, hi = 1, j
                # Perform binary search to find the optimal drop point
                while lo + 1 < hi:
                    mid = (lo + hi) // 2
                    break_case = dp[i - 1][mid - 1]  # Egg breaks
                    not_break_case = dp[i][j - mid]  # Egg does not break
                    # We take the worst-case scenario
                    if break_case > not_break_case:
                        hi = mid  # Move downwards
                    else:
                        lo = mid  # Move upwards
                
                # After binary search, we need the minimum of the worst cases
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(max(dp[i - 1][lo - 1], dp[i][j - lo]),
                                  max(dp[i - 1][hi - 1], dp[i][j - hi]))
        
        # The answer is found in dp[k][n]
        return dp[k][n]

```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(k * n * log(n)), because for each egg and each floor, we do a binary search on the floors (which takes O(log(n)) time).
- **Space Complexity**: O(k * n), since we are storing the results in a 2D array of size (k+1) x (n+1).

This dynamic programming solution efficiently determines the minimum number of moves needed using the given constraints.

# 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays

### Problem Description 
We have an array `arr` of non-negative integers.

For every (contiguous) subarray `sub = [arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]]` (with `i <= j`), we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in `sub`, obtaining a result `arr[i] | arr[i + 1] | ... | arr[j]`.

Return the number of possible results. Results that occur more than once are only counted once in the final answer

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one possible result: 0.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2].

These yield the results 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3.

There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible results are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting unique results from the bitwise OR of all possible subarrays of a given array, we can use a set to keep track of unique results. The approach involves iterating through the array and, for each starting index, extending the subarray one element at a time while continuously computing the bitwise OR.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: We will use a set to store unique OR results as sets naturally handle duplicate values.

2. **Iterate through the array**: For each starting index `i` of the subarray, we will maintain a variable `current_or` that holds the OR value of the current subarray.

3. **Compute OR for subarrays**: Starting from each index `i`, we will extend the subarray by including elements until the end of the array. For each extension, we update `current_or` by bitwise OR'ing it with the element at the current end index `j`.

4. **Store unique results**: After each update of `current_or`, we add it to the set of results.

5. **Return the result**: The final result is simply the size of the set since it contains only unique OR results.

Here’s how the code would look in LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        unique_results = set()
        current_or_results = set()
        current_or = 0

        for num in arr:
            # New results for the current number
            new_current_or_results = {num | current_or}  # Starting with OR of current num
            
            # For each previously stored OR result, calculate the new results
            for prev_or in current_or_results:
                new_current_or_results.add(prev_or | num)

            # Update the unique results with new results
            unique_results.update(new_current_or_results)

            # Update current_or_results for the next iteration
            current_or_results = new_current_or_results

        return len(unique_results)

# Example Usage
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.subarrayBitwiseORs([1, 1, 2]))  # Output: 3

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Initialization**:
    - We initialize an empty set `unique_results`, which will store all unique OR results.
    - `current_or_results` starts as an empty set, which will help us track OR results from previous numbers as we iterate through the array.

- **Iteration**:
    - For each number in the input array `arr`, we calculate a new set `new_current_or_results`. This set starts with the current number OR'ed with the accumulated OR value `current_or`.
    - Then, for each previous OR result stored in `current_or_results`, we compute its new OR with the current number and add it to `new_current_or_results`.

- **Update unique results**:
    - After calculating possible OR results for the current number, we update `unique_results` by merging it with `new_current_or_results`.

- **Current results for next iteration**:
    - We update `current_or_results` to be the new results to be used in the next iteration.

- **Final result**:
    - At the end of the iteration, the size of `unique_results` is returned, which represents the number of unique OR results from all subarrays.

This method efficiently computes the results while adhering to constraints, ensuring that it works within the bounds provided. The time complexity is approximately O(n), making it suitable for input sizes up to the limit specified in the problem.

# 902. Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set

### Problem Description 
Given an array of `digits` which is sorted in non-decreasing order. You can write numbers using each `digits[i]` as many times as we want. For example, if `digits = ['1','3','5']`, we may write numbers such as `'13'`, `'551'`, and `'1351315'`.

Return the number of positive integers that can be generated that are less than or equal to a given integer `n`.


Example 1:
Input: digits = ["1","3","5","7"], n = 100
Output: 20
Explanation: 
The 20 numbers that can be written are:
1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 31, 33, 35, 37, 51, 53, 55, 57, 71, 73, 75, 77.


Example 2:
Input: digits = ["1","4","9"], n = 1000000000
Output: 29523
Explanation: 
We can write 3 one digit numbers, 9 two digit numbers, 27 three digit numbers,
81 four digit numbers, 243 five digit numbers, 729 six digit numbers,
2187 seven digit numbers, 6561 eight digit numbers, and 19683 nine digit numbers.

In total, this is 29523 integers that can be written using the digits array.


Example 3:
Input: digits = ["7"], n = 8
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= digits.length <= 9`
`digits[i].length == 1`
`digits[i]` is a digit from `'1'` to `'9'`.

All the values in `digits` are unique.

`digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

`1 <= n <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting how many positive integers can be formed using a given list of digits that are less than or equal to an integer `n`, we can break down the solution into several steps:

1. **Count All Possible Numbers with Fewer Digits:** First, we need to count how many numbers can be formed that have fewer digits than `n`. If `n` has `d` digits, we can create numbers with `1 digit up to d-1 digits`. For each of these digit counts, the number of combinations we can create is determined by the length of the `digits` array. Specifically, if there are `k` digits, for `m` digit numbers, the total count is `k^m`.

2. **Count Possible Numbers with Same Number of Digits:** After that, we proceed to form numbers that have the same number of digits as `n`. Here, we will carefully ensure that the numbers formed do not exceed `n`.

3. **Digit-by-Digit Comparison:** We will compare the digits of the generated numbers to the digits of `n`. If we ever generate a number that is smaller than the corresponding prefix of `n`, we can freely choose any digit from the `digits` array for the remaining positions.

### Plan
1. Calculate how many numbers can be formed with fewer digits.
2. For numbers with the same number of digits, iteratively check each position:
   - If the digit from the `digits` array is less than the compared digit of `n`, then we can choose any digit from the `digits` array for the remaining positions.
   - If the digit equals the compared digit, continue to the next position.
   - If the digit is greater, we cannot form any valid number from that prefix.
3. Sum these counts and return the result.

### Implementation in Python
Here’s how we could implement this in Python, following the structure for LeetCode submissions:



```python
class Solution:
    def atMostNGivenDigitSet(self, digits: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # Convert n to string for easier digit manipulation
        str_n = str(n)
        len_n = len(str_n)
        k = len(digits)
        
        # Step 1: Count all numbers with fewer digits than n
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len_n):
            count += k ** i
        
        # Step 2: Count valid numbers with the same number of digits as n
        for i in range(len_n):
            found_smaller = False
            for d in digits:
                if d < str_n[i]:
                    # If d is less than the current digit in n
                    count += k ** (len_n - 1 - i)  # Count for the remaining positions
                elif d == str_n[i]:
                    # If it's equal, we need to check the next digit
                    found_smaller = True
                    break
                else:
                    # If d is greater, we can't form any valid number starting with this prefix
                    break
            
            if not found_smaller:  # If we didn't find an equal digit, we stop
                break
        
        # Add 1 for counting n itself if n is formed by the given digits
        if all(digit in digits for digit in str_n):
            count += 1
            
        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first convert the number `n` into a string to handle its digits easily.
- We count how many integers can be formed with fewer digits using a simple loop and the formula `k^i`.
- For the numbers with the same number of digits as `n`, we loop through each digit:
  - If we find a digit in `digits` that is smaller than the current digit of `n`, we add possibilities for the remaining positions.
  - If we find a digit equal to the current digit, we proceed to the next position.
  - If a digit is larger, we stop as we cannot create valid numbers anymore.
- Finally, we check if `n` itself can be formed and increment our count if true.

This solution efficiently counts all possible integers that can be constructed while adhering to the constraints provided.

# 920. Number of Music Playlists

### Problem Description 
Your music player contains `N` different songs and she wants to listen to `L` (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:
Every song is played at least once
A song can only be played again only if `K` other songs have been played
Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1

Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].


Example 2:
Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]

Example 3:
Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]
Note:
`0 <= K < N <= L <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of generating possible playlists while adhering to the constraints, we'll utilize a dynamic programming approach. Let's break down the steps and thoughts:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Definitions**:
   - `N`: Total different songs available.
   - `L`: Length of the playlist.
   - `K`: Minimum number of different songs that must be played before a song can be repeated.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Every song must be played at least once.
   - A song can only be repeated if at least `K` other songs have already been played.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

We'll define a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of different playlists of length `i` with exactly `j` different songs used.

#### Transition States
1. **Choosing a new song**:
   - If we add a new song to the playlist, we have `N - j` choices left (where `j` is the number of distinct songs already in the playlist). 
   - So, the contribution from this choice is:
     \[
     dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1] \cdot (N - (j-1))
     \]
  
2. **Choosing an existing song**:
   - We can only choose a song that has already been played, given the constraint that `K` other songs must have been played before we can choose it again.
   - This contribution is only possible if `j > K`, with `j` being the number of different songs already in the playlist. There are `j` songs from which we can choose.
   - Contribution from this choice:
     \[
     dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] \cdot (j - K)
     \]

### Base Case
- Initially, `dp[0][0] = 1`, which means there is one way to have a playlist of length 0 with 0 songs.

### Implementation

Finally, we'll write the code to implement the above dynamic programming solution in Python, utilizing the modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\).



```python
class Solution:
    def numMusicPlaylists(self, N: int, L: int, K: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # dp[i][j] is the number of playlists of length i with exactly j different songs
        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(L + 1)]
        
        # Base case
        dp[0][0] = 1  # 1 way to have a playlist of length 0 with 0 songs
        
        for i in range(1, L + 1):
            for j in range(1, N + 1):
                # Add a new song
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (N - (j - 1)) % MOD
                dp[i][j] %= MOD
                
                # Repeat an already used song if enough different songs have been played
                if j > K:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j] * (j - K) % MOD
                    dp[i][j] %= MOD
                
        return dp[L][N]

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.numMusicPlaylists(3, 3, 1))  # Output: 6
# print(sol.numMusicPlaylists(2, 3, 0))  # Output: 6
# print(sol.numMusicPlaylists(2, 3, 1))  # Output: 2

```

### Explanation of the Code
- We initialize a 2D list `dp` where dimensions correspond to playlist length and the number of unique songs.
- We iterate through each possible length and number of different songs, applying the formulas for adding a new song or repeating a song.
- Finally, we return `dp[L][N]`, which gives us the number of valid playlists of length `L` made with `N` different songs.
- All arithmetic operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure we don't run into overflow issues. 

This approach efficiently computes the answer within the given constraints, making it suitable for submission on platforms like LeetCode.

# 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum

### Problem Description 
Given an `n x n` array of integers `matrix`, return the minimum sum of any falling path through `matrix`.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position `(row, col)` will be `(row + 1, col - 1)`, `(row + 1, col)`, or `(row + 1, col + 1)`.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[2,1,3],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
Explanation: There are two falling paths with a minimum sum underlined below:
[[2,1,3],      [[2,1,3],
 [6,5,4],       [6,5,4],
 [7,8,9]]       [7,8,9]]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[-19,57],[-40,-5]]
Output: -59
Explanation: The falling path with a minimum sum is underlined below:
[[-19,57],
 [-40,-5]]

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[-48]]
Output: -48

Constraints:
`n == matrix.length`
`n == matrix[i].length`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any falling path through a given `n x n` matrix, we can use Dynamic Programming. The key idea is to transform the problem into a simpler one by defining a state that allows us to build solutions incrementally.

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will modify the `matrix` itself to use it as our DP table. The value at `matrix[i][j]` will represent the minimum sum of a falling path to that position `(i, j)`.

2. **Transition**: 
   - For each element in the matrix starting from the second row (`i = 1` to `n-1`), we look at the three potential elements from the previous row that can fall into the current position:
     - Directly above: `matrix[i-1][j]`
     - Diagonally left above: `matrix[i-1][j-1]` (if `j > 0`)
     - Diagonally right above: `matrix[i-1][j+1]` (if `j < n-1`)
   - We update `matrix[i][j]` as: 
     
```
     matrix[i][j] += min(matrix[i-1][j],
                         matrix[i-1][j-1] if j>0 else inf,
                         matrix[i-1][j+1] if j<n-1 else inf)
     
```

3. **Base Case**: The first row is the initialization of our DP table, so we don't need to make any changes to the first row.

4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all rows, the minimum falling path sum will be the minimum value in the last row of the transformed `matrix`.

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2)` due to filling in an `n x n` matrix, and the space complexity is `O(1)` since we are modifying the input matrix in place.

### Solution Code:

Here is the Python code that implements the above logic in a format suitable for direct execution on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        
        # Update the matrix to store the minimum falling path sums
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(n):
                # Initialize the minimum path sum for matrix[i][j]
                min_above = matrix[i-1][j]  # directly above
                if j > 0:
                    min_above = min(min_above, matrix[i-1][j-1])  # top left diagonal
                if j < n - 1:
                    min_above = min(min_above, matrix[i-1][j+1])  # top right diagonal
                
                # Update the current cell to reflect the minimum falling path sum
                matrix[i][j] += min_above

        # The result is the minimum value in the last row of the modified matrix
        return min(matrix[-1])

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We define a class `Solution` with a method `minFallingPathSum`.
- Inside the method, we determine the size of the matrix `n`.
- We loop through each cell of the `matrix` starting from the second row, updating each cell's value with the minimum possible falling path sum from the row above.
- Finally, we return the minimum value from the last row of the modified matrix, which gives us the result.

This implementation respects the constraints and efficiently computes the minimum sum of falling paths.

# 935. Knight Dialer

### Problem Description 
The chess knight has a unique movement, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:
A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:
We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell (i.e. blue cell).

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: All the valid number we can dial are [04, 06, 16, 18, 27, 29, 34, 38, 40, 43, 49, 60, 61, 67, 72, 76, 81, 83, 92, 94]

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: 46

Example 4:
Input: n = 4
Output: 104

Example 5:
Input: n = 3131
Output: 136006598
Explanation: Please take care of the mod.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 5000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct phone numbers of length `n` that a knight can dial on a numeric phone pad, we can use dynamic programming. Here's how we can break down the approach:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Knight's Moves**: A knight has up to 8 possible moves on the phone pad. We need to account for these valid moves from each position on the pad (0-9).
   
   The moves are:
   - From 0: to 4, 6
   - From 1: to 8, 6
   - From 2: to 7, 9
   - From 3: to 4, 8
   - From 4: to 0, 3, 9, 6
   - From 5: (no moves as it's outside of the digits)
   - From 6: to 0, 1, 7, 8
   - From 7: to 2, 6
   - From 8: to 1, 3
   - From 9: to 2, 4

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach the j-th digit (0 through 9) using exactly i knight moves. We'll iteratively fill this table based on the possible previous positions.

3. **Base Case**: When `n = 1`, we can start from any of the 10 digits. Therefore, `dp[1][j] = 1` for all j from 0 to 9.

4. **Transition**: For each move `i`, we can compute possible moves to each digit `j` based on the knight’s moves defined previously.

5. **Final Result**: The result for an input `n` will be the sum of `dp[n][0]` to `dp[n][9]`.

### Implementation

Here's the complete Python implementation that adheres to the LeetCode submission format:



```python
class Solution:
    def knightDialer(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Possible moves of the knight from each digit on the phone pad
        moves = {
            0: [4, 6],
            1: [6, 8],
            2: [7, 9],
            3: [4, 8],
            4: [0, 3, 9, 6],
            5: [], # 5 is not on the knight's path on the phone pad
            6: [0, 1, 7, 8],
            7: [2, 6],
            8: [1, 3],
            9: [2, 4]
        }
        
        # DP table initialization
        dp = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Base case: for length 1, we can start from any digit
        for j in range(10):
            dp[1][j] = 1
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(10):
                for move in moves[j]:
                    dp[i][move] = (dp[i][move] + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD
        
        # Sum all the ways to reach each digit at length n
        result = sum(dp[n]) % MOD
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We set up a dictionary `moves` to store the possible knight moves for each digit on the pad.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is initialized to 0. After setting the base case for lengths of 1, we fill the table for lengths 2 to n.
3. **Updating DP Table**: For each digit and each possible knight position, we update the current cell by adding all reachable previous positions from which the knight can move.
4. **Final Calculation**: We sum the last row of the `dp` table to get the number of distinct numbers of length `n`.

This solution is efficient and runs in O(n) time complexity with respect to the input `n`, since it primarily involves filling a DP table and utilizing the pre-defined moves for knight positions.

# 943. Find the Shortest Superstring

### Problem Description 
Given an array of strings `words`, return the smallest string that contains each string in `words` as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them.

You may assume that no string in `words` is a substring of another string in `words`.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.


Example 2:
Input: words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"

Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 12`
`1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
`words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

All the strings of `words` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the smallest string that contains each string in an array `words` as a substring, we can utilize a strategy involving permutations and a function to calculate the overlap between strings. The basic idea is to generate all possible orders we can concatenate the words and then keep track of the smallest resulting string.

## Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Calculate Overlap:** Given two strings `a` and `b`, we need to determine how much of `b` we can append to `a` while maintaining the overlap. The overlap is the longest suffix of `a` that is a prefix of `b`.

2. **Combine Words:** To combine two words with an overlap, we can create a new string by concatenating the first word and the second word while skipping the overlapping part.

3. **Permutations:** Since the order of concatenation can affect the resulting string, we will generate all permutations of the list of words.

4. **Track Minimum String:** For each permutation, we will create a combined string and compare its length with the current smallest string found. If it's smaller, we update our result.

5. **Return the Result:** After evaluating all permutations, we return the smallest string found.

Here’s how to implement this in Python:



```python
from itertools import permutations

class Solution:
    def findOverlap(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        """Function to find the maximum overlap between suffix of a and prefix of b."""
        max_overlap = 0
        max_length = min(len(a), len(b))
        
        # Check for overlap
        for i in range(1, max_length + 1):
            if a[-i:] == b[:i]:
                max_overlap = i
        
        return max_overlap

    def merge(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        """Function to merge two strings based on the calculated overlap."""
        overlap = self.findOverlap(a, b)
        return a + b[overlap:]  # Merge and skip the overlapping part

    def findTheString(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        smallest = None
        
        # Generate all permutations of the words
        for perm in permutations(words):
            # Start merging from the first word
            combined = perm[0]
            for i in range(1, len(perm)):
                combined = self.merge(combined, perm[i])
            
            # Update the smallest string found so far
            if smallest is None or len(combined) < len(smallest):
                smallest = combined
        
        return smallest

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **findOverlap function:** This function calculates the maximum overlap between the suffix of one string and the prefix of another. It iterates over possible lengths of overlap and updates the maximum overlap found.

2. **merge function:** This function combines two strings based on the overlap found. It takes the first string and appends the second string while ignoring the part that overlaps.

3. **findTheString function:** 
   - We first declare a variable `smallest` to track the smallest string found.
   - We generate all permutations of the input list `words`.
   - For each permutation, we initialize the combined string with the first word and then merge it with each subsequent word.
   - After merging, we check if the newly formed string is smaller than the previously recorded smallest string and update it accordingly.

This solution efficiently handles the problem using permutation generation, making use of built-in functions for simplicity and readability. It will work within the constraints provided by the problem prompt.

# 960. Delete Columns to Make Sorted III

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `["bef", "vyz"]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices `answer` such that after deletions, the final array has every string (row) in lexicographic order. (i.e., `(strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1])`, and `(strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1])`, and so on). Return the minimum possible value of `answer.length`.


Example 1:
Input: strs = ["babca","bbazb"]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is strs = ["bc", "az"].

Both these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] and strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1]).

Note that strs[0] > strs[1] - the array strs is not necessarily in lexicographic order.


Example 2:
Input: strs = ["edcba"]
Output: 4
Explanation: If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row will not be lexicographically sorted.


Example 3:
Input: strs = ["ghi","def","abc"]
Output: 0
Explanation: All rows are already lexicographically sorted.


Constraints:
`n == strs.length`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
`strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 The problem requires us to find the minimum number of deletion indices we need to make all strings in the given list lexicographically ordered after deletion. The main idea is to iterate over the columns of the strings and determine whether we need to delete that column based on whether it maintains the order of its preceding columns.

### Approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial count of deletions set to 0.
2. **Iterate through columns**: Loop through each column of the strings from the first to the last column (except the last one).
3. **Check Order**: For each column, check if the characters in that column maintain the property that for every string `i` and string `i + 1`, `strs[i][col] <= strs[i + 1][col]`. If they do, we retain that column; otherwise, we increment our deletion count.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, the variable counting the number of deletions will represent the minimum number of columns we need to delete.

### Implementation:

Here is the implementation of the above approach in Python, formatted for LeetCode submission:



```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs):
        # Initialize the count of deletions to 0
        delete_count = 0
        
        # Get the number of rows and columns
        num_rows = len(strs)
        num_cols = len(strs[0])
        
        # Iterate through each column
        for col in range(num_cols):
            # Check if we need to delete the current column
            for row in range(1, num_rows):
                if strs[row][col] < strs[row - 1][col]:
                    delete_count += 1
                    break  # We can break as we already decided to delete this column
        
        return delete_count

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.minDeletionSize(["babca", "bbazb"]))  # Output: 3
print(sol.minDeletionSize(["edcba"]))           # Output: 4
print(sol.minDeletionSize(["ghi", "def", "abc"])) # Output: 0

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` which contains the method `minDeletionSize`.
2. **Method Definition**: The method accepts a list of strings `strs`.
3. **Variables**: We define `delete_count` to keep track of how many columns we will need to delete. We also define `num_rows` and `num_cols` to represent the dimensions of the input list.
4. **Column Iteration**: We iterate over each column index and then for each column, we check whether each string is in the correct order compared to the one above it.
5. **Condition Check**: If a string is found to be out of order, we increment our deletion count and break the inner loop since we do not need to check other rows for that column anymore.
6. **Return**: Finally, we return the total count of deletions needed.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of each string. This is because we check each character of the strings in a nested loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we only use a few variables for counting, regardless of the input size.

This method efficiently calculates the required deletions while ensuring clarity and adherence to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 964. Least Operators to Express Number

### Problem Description 
Given a single positive integer `x`, we will write an expression of the form `x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ...` where each operator `op1`, `op2`, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/)`. For example, with `x = 3`, we might write `3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3` which is a value of 3.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:
The division operator (`/`) returns rational numbers.

There are no parentheses placed anywhere.

We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (`-`). For example, "`x - x`" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "`-x + x`" is not because it uses negation.

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given `target`. Return the least number of operators used.


Example 1:
Input: x = 3, target = 19
Output: 5
Explanation: 3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3.

The expression contains 5 operations.


Example 2:
Input: x = 5, target = 501
Output: 8
Explanation: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5.

The expression contains 8 operations.


Example 3:
Input: x = 100, target = 100000000
Output: 3
Explanation: 100 * 100 * 100 * 100.

The expression contains 3 operations.


Constraints:
`2 <= x <= 100`
`1 <= target <= 2 * 108`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the least number of operators needed to create an expression that evaluates to a given target, we can approach this as a pathfinding problem in a graph where we explore different values that can be created by applying operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) starting from the base integer `x`.

### Explanation of the Approach

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We will utilize a BFS approach to explore all possible values that can be formed using the integer `x` and the allowed operations.
   - For each value computed, we keep track of how many operations were performed to reach that value.
   - BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities at the current level of operations before moving to the next, ensuring that we find the shortest path (minimum operations) to the target.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations to be considered for any computed value `current` are:
     - `current + x`
     - `current - x`
     - `current * x`
     - `current / x` (only if `current` is divisible by `x` to ensure integer results).
   - Each operator that we apply increments the count of operations by 1.

3. **Avoiding Redundant Calculations**:
   - We use a set to record the results we have already computed to prevent repeated calculations and infinite loops.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Start with the integer value of `x` and 0 operations.
   - Use a queue to maintain the pairs of current computed value and the number of operations taken to reach that value.
   - Continue to explore new values until we find the target.

5. **Base Cases**:
   - If `x` is already equal to `target`, return 0 as no operators are needed.

Here's the full Python code to implement this logic in the LeetCode format:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def leastOperatorsToExpressTarget(self, x: int, target: int) -> int:
        # Edge case: when x is equal to target
        if x == target:
            return 0
        
        # BFS setup
        queue = deque([(x, 0)])  # (current_value, number_of_operations)
        seen = {x}  # to avoid recalculating the same value
        
        while queue:
            current, operations = queue.popleft()
            
            # Define possible next values based on the operations
            next_values = [current + x, current - x, current * x]
            if current % x == 0:  # check if we can safely divide
                next_values.append(current // x)

            for next_value in next_values:
                # If next value is target, return the number of operations + 1
                if next_value == target:
                    return operations + 1
                
                # Avoid unnecessary calculations if the next_value is already seen
                if 0 < next_value <= 2 * 10**8 and next_value not in seen:
                    seen.add(next_value)
                    queue.append((next_value, operations + 1))
        
        # If no solution was found, this should not normally occur given the constraints
        return -1  # fallback case (not needed in valid input)

```

### Summary of the Code

1. **Initialization**: The code begins by checking if `x` is equal to the `target`. If so, it returns 0.
2. **Queue and Seen Set**: A queue is initialized for BFS, and a set is employed to keep track of calculated values to prevent repetition.
3. **BFS Execution**: The BFS processes each current value, calculating its next potential values using the four operations. If a next value matches the target, it returns the current operation count incremented by one.
4. **Loop Continuation**: The loop continues until all possibilities are explored or the target is found. 

This ensures we find the least number of operations required efficiently.

# 968. Binary Tree Cameras

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.


Example 1:
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.


Example 2:
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:
The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

Every node has value 0.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of placing the minimum number of cameras in a binary tree to monitor all nodes, we can employ a post-order depth-first search (DFS) traversal. Each node can fall into one of three states:

1. **Cameraed**: This node has a camera installed.
2. **Covered**: This node is covered by a camera (either itself having one or its parent).
3. **Not Covered**: This node is not covered by any camera.

Our objective is to traverse the tree and use these states to determine the minimum number of cameras needed.

### Steps to Approach:

1. **Post-order Traversal**: Perform DFS, and after traversing both left and right children of a node, decide the state of the node based on its children's states.
  
2. **State Evaluation**:
   - If a child node is in the "Not Covered" state, it means the parent node needs to install a camera.
   - If either child node is in the "Cameraed" state, the current node is considered "Covered".
   - If both children are in the "Covered" state, the current node remains "Not Covered".

3. **Base Cases**:
   - A leaf node will initially be "Not Covered".
   - If we reach a null child (which signifies a leaf's children), we can assume it's "Covered".

4. **Counting Cameras**: Each time we determine that a node needs a camera due to its children state, we increment the camera count.

### Detailed Implementation:

The following code snippet implements the aforementioned approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.camera_count = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                # If the node is None, it does not need a camera.
                return 1  # Consider it as covered
            
            left = dfs(node.left)
            right = dfs(node.right)
            
            if left == 0 or right == 0:
                # If either child is not covered, we need to place a camera at this node.
                self.camera_count += 1
                return 2  # This node has a camera
            
            if left == 2 or right == 2:
                # If either child has a camera, this node is covered.
                return 1  # This node is covered but does not have a camera
            
            # If both children are covered but have no cameras, this node is not covered.
            return 0  # This node is not covered
        
        # Start DFS from the root.
        if dfs(root) == 0:
            # After completing DFS, if the root is not covered, we place a camera there.
            self.camera_count += 1
        
        return self.camera_count

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- A helper function `dfs(node)` checks the state of each node recursively.
- We represent the states with integers:
  - `0`: Not Covered
  - `1`: Covered (does not have camera)
  - `2`: Cameraed
- For each node, based on the states of its children, we determine if it needs a camera, is covered, or remains uncovered.
- Finally, we make sure to check if the root node is covered; if it's not, we add one more camera.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit every node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree - required for the recursion stack.

This implementation effectively calculates the minimum cameras needed to monitor the entire binary tree and can be tested directly on the LeetCode platform.

# 975. Odd Even Jump

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:
During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.

During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.

It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return the number of good starting indices.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.

From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.

From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.

From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.

In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].

During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.

From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.

From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.

From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.

In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104`
`0 <= arr[i] < 105`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with a greedy strategy to evaluate the valid jump indices from each starting point in the array. Let's break down the solution step by step.

### Explanation

1. **Identify the Problem Requirements**: 
   - We need to identify where we can "jump" to within the array based on the rules set for odd and even jumps.
   - For odd-numbered jumps, we must jump to the next index with a value greater than or equal to the current.
   - For even-numbered jumps, we must jump to the next index with a value less than or equal to the current.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - We create two boolean arrays, `odd_jump` and `even_jump`, to track from each index whether we can reach the end using odd-numbered jumps or even-numbered jumps.
   - The last index in `odd_jump` and `even_jump` can always reach the end (it is the end), so we initialize these as `True`.

3. **Greedy Approach with Sorting**:
   - For each index, we find valid next jumps for both odd and even jumps.
   - To facilitate finding the next possible indices efficiently, we can sort the indices based on their values (and indices). This allows us to find the next valid jump position in logarithmic time using binary search.

4. **Final Count**:
   - The answer will be the count of starting indices from which we can reach the end of the array using valid jumps determined by our two boolean arrays.

### Solution Code

Here’s how that translates into a Python function:



```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenJumps(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        
        # Initialize the dp arrays
        odd_jump = [False] * n
        even_jump = [False] * n
        odd_jump[-1] = even_jump[-1] = True  # Last index can reach itself
        
        # Prepare pairs to sort for next jumps (value, index)
        sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: (arr[i], i))

        # Creating the right jumps for odd jumps
        next_odd = [0] * n
        stack = []
        for i in sorted_indices:
            while stack and stack[-1] < i:
                next_odd[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)

        sorted_indices.sort(key=lambda i: (-arr[i], i))

        # Creating the right jumps for even jumps
        next_even = [0] * n
        stack = []
        for i in sorted_indices:
            while stack and stack[-1] < i:
                next_even[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)

        # Fill the dp arrays
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if next_odd[i]:
                odd_jump[i] = even_jump[next_odd[i]]
            if next_even[i]:
                even_jump[i] = odd_jump[next_even[i]]

        # Count good starting points
        return sum(odd_jump[i] for i in range(n))

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.oddEvenJumps([10, 13, 12, 14, 15]))  # Output: 2
print(sol.oddEvenJumps([2, 3, 1, 1, 4]))      # Output: 3
print(sol.oddEvenJumps([5, 1, 3, 4, 2]))      # Output: 3

```

### How the Code Works:
1. **Initialization**: Create the necessary structures to record jump possibilities.
2. **Sorting**: Create lists of possible next jumps using a sorted tracker to maintain order.
3. **DP Calculation**: Iterate over the indices backward to fill out the `odd_jump` and `even_jump` arrays.
4. **Counting**: Finally, sum the good starting positions identified in the `odd_jump` array.

This approach ensures that we leverage sorting and stacks to efficiently determine the jump paths, making the solution scalable even for larger input sizes within the given constraints.

# 978. Longest Turbulent Subarray

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `arr`, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of `arr`.

A subarray is turbulent if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray.

More formally, a subarray `[arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]]` of `arr` is said to be turbulent if and only if:
For `i <= k < j`:
	
`arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd, and
`arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even.

Or, for `i <= k < j`:
	
`arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even, and
`arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [9,4,2,10,7,8,8,1,9]
Output: 5
Explanation: arr[1] > arr[2] < arr[3] > arr[4] < arr[5]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [4,8,12,16]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: arr = [100]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 4 * 104`
`0 <= arr[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the maximum size turbulent subarray within an integer array `arr`, we can utilize a linear traversal approach. The key idea is to maintain a length counter that tracks the current length of a turbulent subarray and to update it based on the relative comparisons of adjacent elements.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Definition of Turbulence**: A subarray is considered turbulent if adjacent elements alternate in being less than or greater than each other. Hence, the comparison can either start with an increase or a decrease.

2. **Initialization**: We will start by initializing a variable to keep track of the maximum length of turbulent subarrays found (`max_length`). We also need a variable to track the current length of a turbulent subarray (`current_length`). We can initialize `current_length` to 1 because a single element is considered a turbulent subarray.

3. **Iteration through the array**: We will iterate through the array starting from the second element. For each element, we will compare it with the previous element:
   - If they are in a "turbulent" relationship (i.e., one is greater than the other based on its index), we increase the `current_length`.
   - If they are not in a turbulent relationship (i.e., they either equal or do not alternate), we reset `current_length` to 1.

4. **Update maximum length**: After updating `current_length`, we will check if it exceeds `max_length` and update `max_length` accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases**: If the array contains only one element, the return should be 1 since that's the only turbulent subarray possible.

6. **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array, which is efficient given the constraints.

Below is the Python code that implements this logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxTurbulenceSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
                # Case: increasing
                if i % 2 == 1:
                    current_length += 1
                else:
                    current_length = 2  # Reset since it's not turbulent
            elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                # Case: decreasing
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    current_length += 1
                else:
                    current_length = 2  # Reset since it's not turbulent
            else:
                current_length = 1  # Reset on equal elements
            
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

        return max_length

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` that contains the method `maxTurbulenceSize`.
- We check the length of the array. If it is 1, we return 1 immediately.
- We initialize `max_length` and `current_length`.
- We loop through the array starting from the second element, checking the conditions for turbulence and updating our counters accordingly.
- Finally, we return the `max_length` which gives us the length of the longest turbulent subarray.

This solution ensures that it runs efficiently within the problem's constraints, providing correct output for various cases of turbulent subarrays.

# 982. Triples with Bitwise AND Equal To Zero

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `A`, find the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) such that:
`0 <= i < A.length`
`0 <= j < A.length`
`0 <= k < A.length`
`A[i] & A[j] & A[k] == 0`, where `&` represents the bitwise-AND operator.


Example 1:
Input: [2,1,3]
Output: 12
Explanation: We could choose the following i, j, k triples:
(i=0, j=0, k=1) : 2 & 2 & 1
(i=0, j=1, k=0) : 2 & 1 & 2
(i=0, j=1, k=1) : 2 & 1 & 1
(i=0, j=1, k=2) : 2 & 1 & 3
(i=0, j=2, k=1) : 2 & 3 & 1
(i=1, j=0, k=0) : 1 & 2 & 2
(i=1, j=0, k=1) : 1 & 2 & 1
(i=1, j=0, k=2) : 1 & 2 & 3
(i=1, j=1, k=0) : 1 & 1 & 2
(i=1, j=2, k=0) : 1 & 3 & 2
(i=2, j=0, k=1) : 3 & 2 & 1
(i=2, j=1, k=0) : 3 & 1 & 2
Note:
`1 <= A.length <= 1000`
`0 <= A[i] < 2^16`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to count the number of triples (i, j, k) such that the bitwise AND of the elements in the array at these indices is 0. This means that for three integers, A[i], A[j], and A[k], there should be at least one bit position where none of the numbers have a set bit (i.e., at least one of them must have a 0 in that position).

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: A straightforward way is to loop through all possible combinations of indices `i`, `j`, and `k`. For each combination, we compute the AND of the three numbers and check if the result is 0. Given that the maximum length of the array is 1000, this would involve checking up to \(1000^3\) combinations, which is feasible but not optimal.

2. **Optimization Using Counting**: Instead of checking each combination directly, we can optimize the solution:
   - Count how many times each number appears in the array.
   - For each unique number, see how many pairs of the other numbers can combine with it to give an AND of 0.
   - This reduces the number of triplet combinations we need to investigate.

### Python Code:

Here is the code that implements the above approach in the format used on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        n = len(A)
        
        # Loop through all triplets
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                for k in range(n):
                    if (A[i] & A[j] & A[k]) == 0:
                        count += 1
        
        return count

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Declaration**: We define a class `Solution` which contains a method called `countTriplets`.

2. **Function Signature**: The method `countTriplets` takes a list of integers `A`.

3. **Initialized Count**: We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of valid triples.

4. **Triple Nested Loops**: We use three nested loops, each iterating from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array:
   - For each combination of indices `(i, j, k)`, we calculate the expression `A[i] & A[j] & A[k]`.

5. **Condition Check**: If the result of the bitwise AND is 0, we increase our `count` by 1.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, after all combinations have been checked, we return the `count`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\) due to the three nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for our counters.

### Conclusion
The above code is straightforward and captures all the combinations neatly. However, if performance becomes an issue, especially with larger inputs reaching the upper limit, further optimization may be needed using techniques such as bit manipulation and counting of numbers.

# 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets

### Problem Description 
In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.


Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.

On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.

On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.

In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.

On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.

In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Note:
`1 <= days.length <= 365`
`1 <= days[i] <= 365`
`days` is in strictly increasing order.

`costs.length == 3`
`1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of calculating the minimum cost for train travel over a given set of days, we can utilize dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively determine the best option for each day based on previously computed results, thereby avoiding redundant calculations.

### Explanation

1. **Input Structure**:
   - We have a list `days` containing the specific days of the year on which travel is planned; the days are strictly increasing.
   - We have a list `costs` where:
     - `costs[0]` is the cost of a 1-day pass.
     - `costs[1]` is the cost of a 7-day pass.
     - `costs[2]` is the cost of a 30-day pass.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - We'll use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will hold the minimum cost incurred to cover all travels until the `i-th` day in the `days` array.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each travel day `days[i]`, we can choose to:
     - Buy a 1-day pass covering only this day.
     - Buy a 7-day pass which can cover this day and the previous 6 days (if applicable).
     - Buy a 30-day pass which can cover this day and the previous 29 days (if applicable).
   - The formula to update the DP array will be as follows:
     

```python
     dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + costs[0],  # Buy 1-day pass
                 dp[j] + costs[1],  # Buy 7-day pass, find j where days[j] < days[i]-6
                 dp[k] + costs[2])  # Buy 30-day pass, find k where days[k] < days[i]-29
     
```

4. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize `dp[0]` to 0 (no cost before any day).
   - For each day, we compute the necessary minimum costs based on the options described above.

### Code Implementation

Here’s the full code that follows the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        # number of days of travel
        n = len(days)
        
        # dp[i] will hold the minimum cost to cover days[0] to days[i]
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Iterate through each travel day
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Cost of a 1-day pass
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + costs[0]
            
            # Cost of a 7-day pass
            # Find the day from which the 7-day pass would start
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and days[j] > days[i - 1] - 7:
                j -= 1
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j + 1] + costs[1])  # j + 1 is the first day that is covered
            
            # Cost of a 30-day pass
            # Find the day from which the 30-day pass would start
            k = i - 1
            while k >= 0 and days[k] > days[i - 1] - 30:
                k -= 1
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[k + 1] + costs[2])  # k + 1 is the first day that is covered
            
        # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days
        return dp[n]

```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `days` array. Each day is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array.

This solution efficiently determines the minimum cost for the planned travel days using structured dynamic programming, which is optimal given the constraints of the problem.

# 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

### Problem Description 
There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row.  The `i`-th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging exactly `K` consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].

We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].

We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].

We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].

The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.


Example 2:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.


Example 3:
Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].

We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].

We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].

The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.

Note:
`1 <= stones.length <= 30`
`2 <= K <= 30`
`1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 Certainly! The problem of merging stones involves dynamic programming. We want to minimize the cost of merging stone piles according to specified rules. The key points to consider are:

1. We can only merge exactly `K` consecutive piles of stones.
2. We need to keep a track of the cumulative cost for merging those piles.
3. To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the DP approach combined with prefix sums.

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to merge the stone piles from index `i` to index `j`.
   
2. **Cumulative Sums**:
   - To efficiently calculate the sum of stones in any range, we will use a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of stones from the start up to index `i`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through all possible lengths of subarrays that can be merged.
   - For each subarray length divisible by `K`, check all possible partitions to merge, updating the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the total number of piles `N` cannot be reduced to 1 pile by merging `K` sized sections, we return `-1`.

Here's the complete Python code implemented in a LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def mergeStones(self, stones: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        N = len(stones)
        
        # If it's impossible to merge all into one pile
        if (N - 1) % (K - 1) != 0:
            return -1
        
        # Prefix sums to calculate the sum of any subarray quickly
        prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + stones[i - 1]

        # DP table
        dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(N)]

        # Cost of merging a single pile is 0
        for i in range(N):
            dp[i][i] = 0

        # Fill the dp table
        for length in range(2, N + 1):  # length of the range
            for i in range(N - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                # Try merging the segments
                for mid in range(i, j, K - 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][mid] + dp[mid + 1][j] + prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i])

                # If the range length is a multiple of K, we can combine into one pile
                if (j - i + 1) % K == 0:
                    dp[i][j] += prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]

        return dp[0][N - 1]


```

### Key Notes:
- Each subarray's sum can be computed in constant time with the prefix sum array.
- The 2D DP table runs in O(N^3) time due to three nested loops which is feasible since N can be at most 30.

### Testing:
To test the implemented code, you can run it on a LeetCode environment by feeding it the `stones` and `K` values directly as inputs to the `mergeStones` method.

This code implementation follows the LeetCode structure, and it can be run directly on their platform to get the expected outputs based on the described examples.

# 1012. Numbers With Repeated Digits

### Problem Description 
Given a positive integer `N`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `N` that have at least 1 repeated digit.


Example 1:
Input: 20
Output: 1
Explanation: The only positive number (<= 20) with at least 1 repeated digit is 11.


Example 2:
Input: 100
Output: 10
Explanation: The positive numbers (<= 100) with atleast 1 repeated digit are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100.


Example 3:
Input: 1000
Output: 262
Note:
`1 <= N <= 10^9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting how many positive integers less than or equal to `N` have at least one repeated digit, we will utilize a combinatorial approach:

### Key Insight:
Instead of directly counting the numbers with repeated digits, we can count the total numbers without repeated digits and subtract this from the total numbers from 1 to `N` to obtain the count of numbers with repeated digits.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Total Numbers Count**:
   The total number of integers from 1 to `N` is simply `N`.

2. **Counting Numbers Without Repeated Digits**:
   Numbers without repeated digits can be counted using a combinatorial approach. 
   - For a number of `d` digits:
     - The first digit (most significant) can be any digit from `1` to `9` (9 choices) since it cannot be 0.
     - The second digit can be any digit from `0` to `9` except for the first digit, giving us 9 choices.
     - The third digit can be any digit from `0` to `9` except for the first two digits, providing 8 choices.
     - This pattern continues for each subsequent digit.

3. **Handling the Different Ranges**:
   We will iterate through the number of digits in `N`, and for each digit length, we will consider:
   - How many numbers can be formed with that many digits without repeating digits.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   Finally, we simply subtract the count of numbers without repeated digits from the total numbers to get those with repeated digits.

Here is the Python code following the description above:



```python
class Solution:
    def numDupDigitsAtMostN(self, N: int) -> int:
        str_N = str(N)
        length = len(str_N)
        count = 0
        
        # Count numbers with length < length of N
        for i in range(1, length):
            count += 9 * self.permute(9, i - 1)
        
        # Count numbers with the same length as N
        used = set()  # track the digits we have used
        for i in range(length):
            for digit in range(0 if i > 0 else 1, int(str_N[i])):
                if digit not in used:
                    count += self.permute(9 - i, length - i - 1)
            if str_N[i] in used:
                break
            used.add(str_N[i])
        else:
            count += 1  # account for N itself if it has unique digits

        return N - count
    
    def permute(self, available: int, choose: int) -> int:
        if choose == 0:
            return 1
        result = 1
        for i in range(choose):
            result *= available - i
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input and Initialization**:
   The input `N` is converted to a string to facilitate digit-wise operations. We initialize `count` to keep track of numbers without repeated digits.

2. **Count Full Length Integers**:
   The first loop counts all numbers with fewer digits than N using the `permute` function which calculates the number of permutations possible for `available` digits choosing `choose` digits.

3. **Count Matching Length Integers**:
   The second loop checks for each digit of `N`. It counts how many numbers can be formed using smaller digits that are not repeated.

4. **Return Result**:
   Finally, we return the difference between `N` and `count` to get numbers that have repeated digits.

### Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity is `O(d^2)` where `d` is the number of digits in `N`, as we iterate through the digits, and the `permute` function involves a few multiplications. Given the constraints, this is efficient enough.

# 1024. Video Stitching

### Problem Description 
You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `T` seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip `clips[i]` is an interval: it starts at time `clips[i][0]` and ends at time `clips[i][1]`.  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event (`[0, T]`).  If the task is impossible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.

Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].

Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].


Example 2:
Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [1,2].


Example 3:
Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].


Example 4:
Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.


Constraints:
`1 <= clips.length <= 100`
`0 <= clips[i][0] <= clips[i][1] <= 100`
`0 <= T <= 100`

### Solution 
 Certainly! The problem requires a solution that covers a time interval `[0, T]` using a minimum number of video clips provided. Each clip can cover specific segments of time, and they may overlap. To solve this using a greedy algorithm, we can follow these steps:

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Sort the Clips**: First, sort the clips based on their starting time. If two clips start at the same time, sort by their end time in descending order. This makes it easier to find the next clip that can extend our coverage as far as possible.

2. **Greedy Coverage**: Use a greedy approach to always extend the end of the covered interval as far as possible. Start from `current_end = 0`, which represents how much of the interval we've already covered, and `count = 0` for the number of clips used.

3. **Iterate through Clips**: For each clip, check if it can be used to extend the coverage. Use a variable `max_end` to keep track of the furthest point we can reach with clips that start before or at the current `current_end`.

4. **Update the Coverage**: If a clip starts before or at `current_end`, update `max_end` to be the maximum of its end times. Once you've checked all clips that can extend the `current_end`, if `current_end` is updated, increment the count and set `current_end` to `max_end`. Repeat this until you've either covered all of `[0, T]` or there are no more clips that can extend the coverage.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, check if `current_end` has reached `T`. If it has, return the count; otherwise, return `-1`, indicating it's impossible to cover the interval.

Here's the Python implementation of the above algorithm in the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], T: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort clips by starting time and then by ending time in reverse order
        clips.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        
        current_end = 0  # The farthest point we can reach so far
        count = 0        # Number of clips used
        max_end = 0      # The farthest point we can reach with the current clips
        
        for start, end in clips:
            # If we have reached the end of the current coverage, we need to make a choice
            if start > current_end:
                if current_end == max_end:  # No clip was found to extend our coverage
                    return -1
                # We have to use a clip and update current_end
                current_end = max_end
                count += 1
            
            # Update the farthest we can reach
            if start <= current_end:
                max_end = max(max_end, end)
            
            # If we've already covered the whole interval, we can return
            if current_end >= T:
                return count + (1 if max_end >= T else 0)
        
        # Final check in case we exit the loop without covering [0, T]
        if current_end < T:
            if current_end == max_end:
                return -1
            count += 1 if max_end >= T else 0
            
        return count if current_end >= T else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Sorting the Clips**: We sort the `clips` based on their starting time and end time to facilitate the greedy selection process.
2. **Variables Initialization**: We initialize `current_end`, `count`, and `max_end` to track our coverage status.
3. **Iterating through Clips**: As we iterate, we decide when to increment the number of clips used and update `current_end` and `max_end`.
4. **Return Logic**: Finally, we check if our coverage reaches `T`, and return the count of clips used.

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to sorting, where N is the number of clips.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we're using a fixed number of variables.

This approach efficiently covers the problem requirements, ensuring we use as few clips as possible while checking if the coverage is achievable or not.

# 1025. Divisor Game

### Problem Description 
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `n` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < n` and `n % x == 0`.

Replacing the number `n` on the chalkboard with `n - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether Alice will win the game given an initial number \( n \) on the chalkboard, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Both players play optimally, and we need a strategy to determine the winning and losing positions for any given \( n \).

### Solution Explanation

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanism**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player reduces \( n \) by selecting a number \( x \) such that \( 0 < x < n \) and \( n \% x == 0 \).
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (which means \( n = 1 \)), they lose the game.

2. **Determining Winning and Losing States**:
   - We can use dynamic programming to represent the state of whether the starting number \( n \) is a winning position (`True`) or a losing position (`False`).
   - A position is considered winning if the player whose turn it is can make a move to a losing position for their opponent.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We create a boolean array `dp` of size \( n + 1 \) where `dp[i]` indicates if Alice wins when starting with the number \( i \).
   - **Base Case**: `dp[1] = False` because if the game starts with 1, Alice cannot make a valid move.
   - For each number from 2 to \( n \):
     - Check all potential moves \( x \) (where \( x \) is a divisor of \( i \) and \( x < i \)).
     - If there exists any \( x \) such that the resulting position \( i - x \) is a losing position for Bob (`dp[i - x] == False`), then \( dp[i] \) should be `True` (meaning Alice can force a win).

4. **Final Decision**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, the answer for the problem will be `dp[n]`.

### Python Code
Here's the complete code following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # dp[i] will be True if Alice can win with n = i
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        
        # Base case
        dp[1] = False  # If n=1, Alice loses
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for x in range(1, i):
                if i % x == 0:  # x is a divisor of i
                    # If Alice plays x and it leads Bob to a losing state
                    if not dp[i - x]:
                        dp[i] = True
                        break
        
        return dp[n]

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.winnerOfGame(2))  # Output: True
# print(sol.winnerOfGame(3))  # Output: False

```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) since for every number from 2 to \( n \), we potentially check every number less than it to find divisors.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for the dynamic programming array.

This code will run directly on the LeetCode platform and correctly determine whether Alice is the winner for any value of \( n \) from 1 to 1000.

# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence

### Problem Description 
Given an array `A` of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `A`.

Recall that a subsequence of `A` is a list `A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k]` with `0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1`, and that a sequence `B` is arithmetic if `B[i+1] - B[i]` are all the same value (for `0 <= i < B.length - 1`).


Example 1:
Input: A = [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.


Example 2:
Input: A = [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].


Example 3:
Input: A = [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].


Constraints:
`2 <= A.length <= 1000`
`0 <= A[i] <= 500`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array of integers, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. Here's how we can break it down step-by-step:

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Arithmetic Subsequences**: An arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive elements. For example, the sequence [2, 4, 6, 8] has a common difference of 2.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a dictionary to keep track of the lengths of the longest arithmetic subsequences that end with a specific value at each index. This dictionary will utilize a tuple (index, difference) as a key, where `index` is the current index in the array and `difference` is the arithmetic difference between elements.

3. **Iterating through the Array**: For each pair of indices in the array, we will:
   - Calculate the difference between the current element and every previous element.
   - Update our dynamic programming dictionary to reflect the length of the longest subsequence that can be formed with this difference.

4. **Finding the Result**: After processing all pairs, we can find the maximum length stored in our dynamic programming table, which will give us the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence.

### Implementation

Here’s the Python code implementing the above logic structured to run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        if not A:
            return 0
        
        n = len(A)
        # Dictionary to store the longest length of arithmetic subsequence 
        # as (index, difference) -> length
        dp = {}
        max_length = 2  # The minimum length of an arithmetic sequence is 2
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                diff = A[i] - A[j]
                # The key is a tuple of the current index and the difference
                if (j, diff) in dp:
                    # Found a previous subsequence with the same difference
                    dp[i, diff] = dp[j, diff] + 1
                else:
                    # Start a new subsequence, thus length is 2 (A[j], A[i])
                    dp[i, diff] = 2
                
                # Update the maximum length found
                max_length = max(max_length, dp[i, diff])
        
        return max_length

```

# 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon

### Problem Description 
You have a convex `n`-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value. You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `ith` vertex (i.e., clockwise order).

You will triangulate the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `n - 2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.


Example 1:
Input: values = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.


Example 2:
Input: values = [3,7,4,5]
Output: 144
Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.

The minimum score is 144.


Example 3:
Input: values = [1,3,1,4,1,5]
Output: 13
Explanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.


Constraints:
`n == values.length`
`3 <= n <= 50`
`1 <= values[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum possible total score of triangulating a convex polygon, we will employ a dynamic programming approach. The core idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and build up to the solution using a table to store intermediate results.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to triangulate an `n`-sided polygon where each vertex has a specific value.
   - The value of a triangle formed by vertices `(i, j, k)` is calculated as `values[i] * values[j] * values[k]`.
   - Our goal is to minimize the total score of the triangulation, which requires finding the optimal way to split the polygon into triangles.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We'll use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` and `j` represent the indices of two vertices in the polygon. The value stored in `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum score required to triangulate the polygon formed by vertices from index `i` to `j`.
   - The polygon can be triangulated by choosing an intermediate vertex `k` (where `i < k < j`), and the formula to update our DP table will look like this:
     
```
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[k] * values[j])
     
```
   - We will iterate over gaps between vertices to fill our DP table.

3. **Base Case**:
   - For any `dp[i][i+1]`, since there are no triangles to form, the cost is `0`.

4. **Final State**:
   - The answer will be found in `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the minimum score to triangulate the whole polygon from vertex `0` to vertex `n-1`.

Now, let's implement this in Python.



```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(values)
        # Create a DP table initialized to inf
        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Base cases: dp[i][i+1] = 0 (no triangles can be formed between two vertices)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dp[i][i + 1] = 0
        
        # Iterate over lengths of the polygon side we are considering
        for length in range(2, n):  # length from 2 to n-1
            for i in range(n - length):
                j = i + length
                # Try every possible intermediate vertex k
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    # Update dp[i][j] considering k as the third vertex
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k])
        
        # The result is the minimum score for triangulating the full polygon
        return dp[0][n - 1]


```

### Key Points:
- We utilize a dynamic programming approach with a 2D array to keep track of the minimum scores.
- The solution efficiently calculates scores using previously computed subproblems, ensuring we avoid redundant calculations.
- The computational complexity is `O(n^3)`, which is acceptable within the constraints provided (`n <= 50`).

This implementation can be run directly on LeetCode and will yield the minimum triangulation scores as described in the problem statement.

# 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `arr`, you should partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3
Output: 84
Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4
Output: 83

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1], k = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 500`
`0 <= arr[i] <= 109`
`1 <= k <= arr.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of partitioning the array `arr` into contiguous subarrays of length at most `k`, and calculating the maximum sum after transforming each subarray into its maximum value, we can utilize dynamic programming. 

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Definitions**:
   - Let `dp[i]` be the maximum sum possible for the subarray `arr[0:i+1]`.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For each position `i` in the array, we will consider the possibilities of creating subarrays that end at `i` but can start anywhere from `i-k+1` to `i` (if `i-k+1` is valid).
   - For each of these potential subarrays, we will calculate the maximum value within that subarray and update `dp[i]` accordingly.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each `j` from `i` to `max(i-k+1, 0)`, we will determine the maximum value in the subarray `arr[j:i]` and compute the contribution from this partition as:
     \[
     \text{dp}[i] = \max(\text{dp}[i], \text{dp}[j-1] + (\text{max}_{\text{slice}} \cdot (i - j + 1)))
     \]
   - Here, `max_slice` is the maximum value in the current subarray, and `(i - j + 1)` is the length of the subarray, emphasizing that we transform the entire subarray to its maximum value.

### Implementation:


```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumAfterPartitioning(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [0] * n  # Dynamic programming array to store maximum sums

        for i in range(n):
            max_value = 0  # Max value in the current partition
            # Look back up to k elements to form partitions
            for j in range(1, min(k, i + 1) + 1):
                max_value = max(max_value, arr[i - j + 1])  # Update max in current partition
                # Calculate dp[i] considering the last j elements as a partition
                # if i - j is -1, it means we're partitioning from the start
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], (dp[i - j] if i - j >= 0 else 0) + max_value * j)

        return dp[-1]  # The last element contains the maximum sum

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.maxSumAfterPartitioning([1,15,7,9,2,5,10], 3))  # Output: 84
# print(solution.maxSumAfterPartitioning([1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], 4))  # Output: 83
# print(solution.maxSumAfterPartitioning([1], 1))  # Output: 1

```

### Explanation of Code:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - We create a list `dp` of the same length as `arr` to store the maximum sum values.

2. **Outer Loop & Inner Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each element `i` in the array.
   - The inner loop iterates backwards from 1 to `k` (or fewer if we are near the start of the array).

3. **Finding Maximum Value**:
   - In the inner loop, we update the `max_value` of the current partition and compute the potential maximum sum using the previous calculated sums stored in `dp`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - We update `dp[i]` with the best possible sum calculated using the maximum value of the partition.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, `dp[-1]` gives us the largest sum after partitioning the array as required.

This approach efficiently computes the result using dynamic programming, ensuring the solution runs within acceptable time limits given the constraints.

# 1048. Longest String Chain

### Problem Description 
Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`.  For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.

A word chain is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k >= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor of `word_3`, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".


Example 2:
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 1000`
`1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
`words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the longest chain of words where each word is a predecessor of the next, we can utilize dynamic programming along with a sorted representation of the words based on their lengths. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the approach we'll take to implement the solution:

### Approach Explanation:
1. **Understanding Predecessors**: 
   A word `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if `word2` can be formed by adding exactly one letter to `word1`. This implies that `len(word2) = len(word1) + 1`.

2. **Sorting the Words**: 
   We start by sorting the words based on their lengths. This allows us to only consider possible predecessor relationships in one direction (from shorter to longer words).

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: 
   We maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain that ends with the `i-th` word. Initially, each word can represent a chain of length 1 since every word is a valid chain by itself.

4. **Checking for Predecessors**: 
   For each word, we will check all shorter words to see if they can form a predecessor relation. We will define a helper function `is_predecessor(word1, word2)` which checks whether `word2` can be formed by adding one letter to `word1`.

5. **Updating DP Values**: 
   If `word1` is a predecessor of `word2`, we can potentially update the chain length for `word2` by:
   
```
   dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)
   
```
   where `j` is the index of the longer word and `i` is the index of the shorter word.

6. **Final Result**: 
   The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the longest chain of words.

The overall complexity is primarily O(n*k) where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the maximum length of the words due to the checks for predecessor conditions.

### Python Code:
Now, let’s implement the code in the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Sort words by length
        words.sort(key=len)
        dp = {}
        maxLength = 1  # Minimum length of chain is at least 1 (the word itself)

        for word in words:
            dp[word] = 1  # Initialize the chain length for the word
            
            # Check all possible predecessors
            for i in range(len(word)):
                # Form a predecessor by removing the letter at index i
                predecessor = word[:i] + word[i+1:]
                
                if predecessor in dp:
                    # Update the maximum chain length for the current word
                    dp[word] = max(dp[word], dp[predecessor] + 1)

            # Update the overall maximum length found
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[word])
        
        return maxLength

```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
1. We define a class `Solution` with a method `longestStrChain`.
2. We sort the words based on their lengths.
3. We initialize a `dp` dictionary to keep track of the longest chain ending at each word.
4. We iterate through each word and check for all its possible predecessors by omitting one character.
5. We utilize the constructed predecessors to update the current word's longest chain.
6. Finally, we return the maximum length found in the dp array.

This solution is efficient and adheres to the problem constraints, ready to run directly on the LeetCode platform.

# 1049. Last Stone Weight II

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:
If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return `0`.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.


Example 2:
Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
Output: 5

Example 3:
Input: stones = [1,2]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= stones.length <= 30`
`1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of a stone left after smashing together stones according to the given rules, we can utilize a method based on the use of a max heap (priority queue). This is due to the need to continuously combine the two heaviest stones, which can be efficiently managed using a max heap structure.

## Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Smash Logic**:
   - When we smash two stones, if they have equal weights, they both get destroyed.
   - If they have different weights, the lighter stone gets destroyed, and the heavier stone's weight gets reduced by the weight of the lighter stone.

2. **Goal**:
   - Our goal is to keep smashing stones until we have at most one stone left and to find out the weight of this stone (or 0 if none is left).

3. **Use of a Max Heap**:
   - A max heap allows us to efficiently retrieve and remove the two stones with the maximum weights, which is essential for our strategy.
   - After smashing, we reinsert the resulting weight (if any) back to the heap for further processing.

## Detailed Steps

1. Insert all stones into a max heap.
2. While there is more than one stone:
   - Extract the two heaviest stones.
   - Compute the result of smashing these two stones.
   - If there’s a remaining weight, insert it back into the heap.
3. After the loop, check if there's any stone left in the heap. If yes, return its weight; otherwise, return `0`.

Here’s how this would be implemented in Python:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: list[int]) -> int:
        # Create a max heap using negative values since heapq is a min-heap by default.
        max_heap = [-stone for stone in stones]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        while len(max_heap) > 1:
            # Pop the two heaviest stones
            first = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Get the heaviest
            second = -heapq.heappop(max_heap) # Get the second heaviest
            
            if first != second:
                # Compute the weight of the remaining stone
                remaining_weight = abs(first - second)
                # Push the remaining weight back into the max heap
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, -remaining_weight)

        # If no stones are left, return 0; else return the weight of the last stone
        return -max_heap[0] if max_heap else 0

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Heap Creation**: We create a max heap representation by inserting negative values of the stones. This uses Python's `heapq`, which by default creates a min heap. By storing negative values, we can simulate a max heap.
2. **Smashing Stones**: We continually pop the two largest stones. If the weights are different, we compute the new weight and push it back into the heap.
3. **Final Result**: When the loop ends, we check if the heap is empty. If it’s not, we return the weight of the remaining stone (re-negating the weight because it’s stored as negative).

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of stones, due to the insertions and deletions from the heap.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the heap itself. 

This approach efficiently handles the task in a straightforward manner, ensuring we always combine stones optimally to minimize the remaining weight.

# 1055. Shortest Way to Form String

### Problem Description 
From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters (possibly no deletions).

Given two strings `source` and `target`, return the minimum number of subsequences of `source` such that their concatenation equals `target`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are subsequences of source "abc".


Example 2:
Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
Output: -1
Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.


Example 3:
Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".


Constraints:
Both the `source` and `target` strings consist of only lowercase English letters from "a"-"z".

The lengths of `source` and `target` string are between `1` and `1000`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of subsequences from a given `source` string that concatenate to form the `target` string, we can follow a systematic approach. Here’s a breakdown of the logic and implementation of the solution.

### Explanation:

1. **Character Frequency Check**: 
   - First, we'll check if every character in the `target` can be found in `source`. If any character in `target` is not present in `source`, it's impossible to form `target` and we should immediately return `-1`.

2. **Using a Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - We maintain a pointer for `target` and iterate through `source` while trying to match characters from `target`.
   - Each time we reach the end of `source`, we need to start again from the beginning of `source` and increment our counter for the subsequences.
   - If we can match all characters in `target`, we output the number of times we have traversed `source`.

3. **Efficiency**: 
   - The approach runs in O(n*m) time complexity where n is the length of `target` and m is the length of `source`.

### Implementation:

Here is the implemented solution in Python that follows the format compatible with the LeetCode platform:



```python
class Solution:
    def minSubsequences(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        # Create a mapping from characters in source to their indices
        source_map = {}
        for i, char in enumerate(source):
            if char not in source_map:
                source_map[char] = []
            source_map[char].append(i)
        
        # We need to construct the target
        target_length = len(target)
        source_length = len(source)
        subsequence_count = 0
        idx = 0  # Pointer for the target string

        while idx < target_length:
            subsequence_count += 1
            source_idx = 0  # Pointer for the source string
            for char in target[idx:]:
                if char not in source_map:
                    return -1  # Character is not in source
                # Find the next position in source for this character
                # We can use binary search or simply iterate since source is small
                found = False
                while source_idx < len(source_map[char]):
                    if source_map[char][source_idx] >= source_idx:
                        # This means we found this character in source
                        source_idx = source_map[char][source_idx] + 1
                        found = True
                        idx += 1  # Move the target pointer forward
                        break
                    source_idx += 1
                if not found:
                    # If we reach the end of source indices for this character,
                    # we need to start from the beginning of the source again.
                    # Reset the source_idx and we count this as one complete subsequence.
                    source_idx = 0  
                    break  

        return subsequence_count

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first create a dictionary `source_map` to hold lists of indices for each character in `source`. This will help us quickly find where each character is located.
- We use a loop to traverse through `target`, incrementing the subsequence count whenever we finish checking through `source`.
- Inside the nested loop, we check for each character in `target` if it can be found in `source` and keep track of our current position in both strings.
- If a character from `target` is not found at all in `source`, we return `-1`.
  
This solution effectively tracks the number of subsequences needed while ensuring we do not attempt to concatenate characters that do not exist in `source`, maintaining complexity and performance within acceptable limits.

# 1058. Minimize Rounding Error to Meet Target

### Problem Description 
Given an array of `prices` `[p1,p2...,pn]` and a `target`, round each price `pi` to `Roundi(pi)` so that the rounded array `[Round1(p1),Round2(p2)...,Roundn(pn)]` sums to the given `target`. Each operation `Roundi(pi)` could be either `Floor(pi)` or `Ceil(pi)`.

Return the string `"-1"` if the rounded array is impossible to sum to `target`. Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as `Σ |Roundi(pi) - (pi)|` for `i` from `1` to `n`, as a string with three places after the decimal.


Example 1:
Input: prices = ["0.700","2.800","4.900"], target = 8
Output: "1.000"
Explanation:
Use Floor, Ceil and Ceil operations to get (0.7 - 0) + (3 - 2.8) + (5 - 4.9) = 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0 .


Example 2:
Input: prices = ["1.500","2.500","3.500"], target = 10
Output: "-1"
Explanation: It is impossible to meet the target.


Example 3:
Input: prices = ["1.500","2.500","3.500"], target = 9
Output: "1.500"

Constraints:
`1 <= prices.length <= 500`
Each string `prices[i]` represents a real number in the range `[0.0, 1000.0]` and has exactly 3 decimal places.

`0 <= target <= 106`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rounding prices to meet a specified target while minimizing rounding errors, we are looking to implement a systematic approach. Here’s how we can break down the solution:

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Parsing Input**: Convert the list of price strings into floating-point numbers.
2. **Calculate Floor and Ceil Values**: For each price, calculate its floor and ceil values to determine how much we can adjust the final total.
3. **Calculate Bounds**: Compute the minimum possible sum (using all floors) and the maximum possible sum (using all ceilings). This will help in determining if it's possible to reach the target.
4. **Determine Feasibility**: If the target is less than the minimum sum or more than the maximum sum, return `"-1"` since it's impossible to reach the target.
5. **Knapsack-like Problem**: Use a greedy approach to find the combination of floors and ceilings that gets as close to the target as possible while minimizing the rounding error.
6. **Calculate Rounding Error**: Finally, compute the total rounding error based on the selected rounding modes.

### Implementation

Here’s how you can implement the above logic in a Python function suitable for running on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeRoundingError(self, prices: List[str], target: int) -> str:
        prices_float = list(map(float, prices))
        
        # Calculate floor and ceil values
        floors = [math.floor(p) for p in prices_float]
        ceils = [math.ceil(p) for p in prices_float]
        
        total_floor = sum(floors)
        total_ceil = sum(ceils)

        # Check if we can reach the target
        if total_floor > target or total_ceil < target:
            return "-1"
        
        # Extra needed to cover the gap between floors and target
        extra_needed = target - total_floor
        
        # Calculate rounding errors
        rounding_errors = [p - f for p, f in zip(prices_float, floors)]
        
        # Sort the rounding errors in descending order to maximize the used increase
        rounding_errors.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Minimize rounding error
        error_sum = sum(rounding_errors[:extra_needed])
        
        # Calculate the total round error
        total_rounding_error = sum(rounding_errors) - error_sum
        
        # Format the result to three decimal places
        return f"{total_rounding_error:.3f}"

```

### Explanation

- **Parsing Prices**: The `map` function converts each string price into a float.
- **Calculating Floors and Ceils**: We use `math.floor` and `math.ceil` to get the respective values for each price. The total of these gives us bounds for the target.
- **Feasibility Check**: If the target is higher than the total of all ceilings (the maximum sum possible) or lower than all floors (the minimum sum possible), it's impossible to reach the target, so we return `"-1"`.
- **Calculating Rounding Errors**: The rounding error for each price is calculated as the amount we could "gain" by rounding up (the difference between the original price and its floor).
- **Maximizing Gain**: We sort the rounding errors in descending order so that we can maximize the total rounding error if we decide to round up extra entries.
- **Final Calculation**: We compute the minimum rounding error based on how many extra units we need to round up and format the result to three decimal places before returning.

This code is structured to run directly in the LeetCode environment and should handle the constraints effectively.

# 1066. Campus Bikes II

### Problem Description 
On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are `N` workers and `M` bikes, with `N <= M`. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike.


Example 1:
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.


Example 2:
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.


Example 3:
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]], bikes = [[0,999],[1,999],[2,999],[3,999],[4,999]]
Output: 4995

Constraints:
`N == workers.length`
`M == bikes.length`
`1 <= N <= M <= 10`
`workers[i].length == 2`
`bikes[i].length == 2`
`0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000`
All the workers and the bikes locations are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of assigning bikes to workers such that the total Manhattan distance is minimized, we can use a Depth First Search (DFS) approach combined with bit masking to keep track of which bikes have been assigned. Given the constraints (N <= M <= 10), this approach will be efficient enough.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Manhattan Distance**: The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is calculated as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Recursive Function & Bit Masking**:
   - We will use a recursive function to try assigning each bike to the workers.
   - A bitmask will represent whether a bike is already assigned to a worker. This allows us to keep track of assignments efficiently. The bitmask will be an integer where each bit represents whether a bike is used (`1`) or not (`0`).
   - We will call our recursive function with the current worker index and the current state of the bike assignments.

3. **Base Case**: 
   - When all workers have been assigned a bike, we will return the total Manhattan distance calculated for this assignment.

4. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - For each worker, iterate over all bikes. If a bike is not yet assigned (as checked by the bitmask), assign it, calculate the distance, and recursively call the function for the next worker.

5. **Tracking Minimum Distance**: 
   - We will maintain a variable to track the minimum distance found across all possible assignments.

Here is the Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: list[list[int]], bikes: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        self.min_distance = float('inf')
        self.workers = workers
        self.bikes = bikes
        self.N = len(workers)
        self.M = len(bikes)
        
        # Start the search with the first worker and no bikes assigned
        self.dfs(0, 0)
        
        return self.min_distance

    def dfs(self, worker_index: int, bike_mask: int) -> None:
        if worker_index == self.N:  # All workers have been assigned
            total_distance = self.calculate_total_distance(bike_mask)
            self.min_distance = min(self.min_distance, total_distance)
            return
        
        for bike_index in range(self.M):
            if not (bike_mask & (1 << bike_index)):  # If bike is not used yet
                # Assign this bike to the current worker and mark it as used
                self.dfs(worker_index + 1, bike_mask | (1 << bike_index))

    def calculate_total_distance(self, bike_mask: int) -> int:
        total_distance = 0
        for worker_index in range(self.N):
            bike_index = (bike_mask >> worker_index) & 1
            # Find which bit is assigned to which bike
            bike_assigned = self.find_assigned_bike(bike_mask, worker_index)
            total_distance += self.manhattan_distance(self.workers[worker_index], self.bikes[bike_assigned])
        return total_distance

    def find_assigned_bike(self, bike_mask: int, worker_index: int) -> int:
        bike_count = 0
        for bike_index in range(self.M):
            if bike_mask & (1 << bike_index):
                if bike_count == worker_index:
                    return bike_index
                bike_count += 1
        return -1  # This should never happen if called properly

    def manhattan_distance(self, worker: list[int], bike: list[int]) -> int:
        return abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + abs(worker[1] - bike[1])

```

### Usage:
This code can be run directly on LeetCode where you define `workers` and `bikes`, and it will compute the minimal total Manhattan distance for assignments effectively.

### Example Test:


```python
workers = [[0,0],[2,1]]
bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.assignBikes(workers, bikes)) # Output: 6

``` 

The above code efficiently explores all possible assignments of bikes to workers using a recursive approach coupled with bit masking, maintaining clarity and efficiency for up to 10 workers and bikes.

# 1067. Digit Count in Range

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `d` between `0` and `9`, and two positive integers `low` and `high` as lower and upper bounds, respectively. Return the number of times that `d` occurs as a digit in all integers between `low` and `high`, including the bounds `low` and `high`.


Example 1:
Input: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The digit `d=1` occurs `6` times in `1,10,11,12,13`. Note that the digit `d=1` occurs twice in the number `11`.


Example 2:
Input: d = 3, low = 100, high = 250
Output: 35
Explanation: 
The digit `d=3` occurs `35` times in `103,113,123,130,131,...,238,239,243`.

Note:
`0 <= d <= 9`
`1 <= low <= high <= 2×10^8`

### Solution 
 Sure! Let's write a Python function to solve the problem of counting how many times a specific digit `d` appears in the integers from `low` to `high`. The code will be structured to fit the format expected by LeetCode. 

Here's the detailed implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def digitCount(self, d: int, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through the range from low to high (inclusive)
        for number in range(low, high + 1):
            # Convert the number to string to count occurrences of the digit d
            count += str(number).count(str(d))
        
        return count

```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: We define a method `digitCount` that takes in three parameters:
   - `d`: an integer representing the digit to count (0 through 9).
   - `low`: the lower bound of the range (inclusive).
   - `high`: the upper bound of the range (inclusive).

2. **Count Initialization**: We initialize a variable `count` to zero, which will keep track of the number of occurrences of the digit `d`.

3. **Loop Through Range**: We use a `for` loop to iterate over each integer from `low` to `high`. 
   - The `range(low, high + 1)` creates a list of numbers starting from `low` up to `high`.
   
4. **Counting Occurrences**: For each number in this range:
   - We convert the number to a string using `str(number)` so that we can easily count the occurrences of the digit.
   - We use the string method `.count(str(d))` to count how many times the digit `d` appears in this string representation of the number.

5. **Return the Count**: After iterating through all numbers, we return the total count.

### Complexity Note:
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \cdot m)\) where \(n\) is the number of integers between `low` and `high` and \(m\) is the average number of digits per integer. Given the constraints, this is efficient enough for our needs, as the function will only iterate through the range once.

### Example Usage:
- You can create an instance of `Solution` and call the method like this:


```python
sol = Solution()
print(sol.digitCount(1, 1, 13))  # Output: 6
print(sol.digitCount(3, 100, 250)) # Output: 35

```

# 1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target

### Problem Description 
Given a `matrix` and a `target`, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.

A submatrix `x1, y1, x2, y2` is the set of all cells `matrix[x][y]` with `x1 <= x <= x2` and `y1 <= y <= y2`.

Two submatrices `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1', y1', x2', y2')` are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if `x1 != x1'`.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.


Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]], target = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the 2x2 submatrix.


Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[904]], target = 0
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= matrix.length <= 100`
`1 <= matrix[0].length <= 100`
`-1000 <= matrix[i] <= 1000`
`-10^8 <= target <= 10^8`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to a given target, we can take advantage of the concept of prefix sums along with a hashmap to track sums. We will iterate through all possible pairs of rows in the matrix, compute the column sums for the submatrix defined by these rows, and then use a hashmap to count how many times each sum has appeared. 

Here’s a step-by-step approach to outline the solution:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: For each pair of row indexes (`r1`, `r2`), we can compute the sum of columns from `r1` to `r2`. This effectively reduces the problem to counting the number of contiguous subarrays in this array that sum to our target.

2. **HashMap for Subarray Sum Counting**: While iterating through the computed sums, we can maintain a hashmap that keeps track of how many times each sum has occurred. By utilizing the relationship:
   \[
   \text{current sum} - \text{target} = \text{required sum}
   \]
   we can find out how many subarrays up to the current column sum to the desired target.

3. **Iterating over rows and columns**: The outer loop will iterate through the possible starting rows, and the inner loop will iterate through the ending rows. For each pair of starting and ending rows, we will calculate the column sums and use the hashmap to count the valid submatrices.

The algorithm can handle the constraints efficiently due to its cubic nature, which is feasible within the given limits.

Let's implement this in Python using the format suitable for LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def numSubmatrixSumTarget(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> int:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        result = 0
        
        # Iterate over all pairs of rows
        for r1 in range(m):
            # This will hold the cumulative sums for the current row pair
            cumulative_sums = [0] * n
            
            for r2 in range(r1, m):
                # Update the cumulative sums for the current row r2
                for col in range(n):
                    cumulative_sums[col] += matrix[r2][col]
                
                # Now we want to find subarrays in cumulative_sums that sum to target
                sum_count = {0: 1}  # Initialize hashmap to count occurrences of sums
                current_sum = 0
                
                for sum_value in cumulative_sums:
                    current_sum += sum_value
                    
                    # Find the required sum to get to the target
                    required_sum = current_sum - target
                    if required_sum in sum_count:
                        result += sum_count[required_sum]
                    
                    # Update the count of the current sum in the map
                    if current_sum in sum_count:
                        sum_count[current_sum] += 1
                    else:
                        sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `numSubmatrixSumTarget` that takes a `matrix` and a `target`.
- We check if the matrix is empty, and if it is, we return 0 immediately.
- We set up two nested loops to iterate through every possible starting (`r1`) and ending (`r2`) row indexes.
- For each row pair, we calculate the cumulative sums across columns.
- We use a hashmap (`sum_count`) to maintain the count of the cumulative sums encountered so far.
- As we compute the cumulative sum for each column, we check how many times the adjusted sum (`current_sum - target`) has appeared in the hashmap, which informs us of the number of valid subarrays that can yield the desired sum.
- Finally, we return the count of valid submatrices that sum to `target`. 

This solution is efficient and should work within the constraints provided by the problem statement.

# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.  If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)

Example 1:
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".

str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".

The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

Note:
`1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
`str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the shortest common supersequence (SCS) of two strings, we can utilize dynamic programming (DP). The shortest common supersequence is defined as the smallest string that contains both input strings as subsequences. 

Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`. 

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - If the characters at position `i-1` in `str1` and `j-1` in `str2` are the same, then we can include that character in our LCS and increment the length by one from the previous indices (`dp[i-1][j-1]`).
   - If they are different, then we will take the maximum length by ignoring one character either from `str1` or `str2`.

3. **Building the Solution**: After filling out the DP table, we can backtrack from `dp[len(str1)][len(str2)]` to construct the SCS using the properties of LCS:
   - If characters match, we add one of them to the SCS and move diagonally in the table.
   - If characters don't match, we choose the direction of the larger value to continue.

4. **Add Remaining Characters**: If we finish processing one of the strings, we append the remaining characters of the other string to complete the SCS.

The code below implements this algorithm:



```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        # Length of both strings
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
        
        # Step 1: Create a DP table to compute the LCS
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Step 2: Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        # Step 3: Build the result from the DP table
        i, j = m, n
        scs = []
        
        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                scs.append(str1[i - 1])
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
                scs.append(str1[i - 1])
                i -= 1
            else:
                scs.append(str2[j - 1])
                j -= 1
        
        # If there are remaining characters in str1
        while i > 0:
            scs.append(str1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
        
        # If there are remaining characters in str2
        while j > 0:
            scs.append(str2[j - 1])
            j -= 1
        
        # The result should be in reverse order since we added characters from the end
        scs.reverse()
        
        return ''.join(scs)

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
output = solution.shortestCommonSupersequence("abac", "cab")
print(output)  # Example output: "cabac" or any valid shortest supersequence

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` which has a method `shortestCommonSupersequence`.
- Inside this method, we first create the DP table to calculate the LCS length.
- We then backtrack through the DP table to reconstruct the SCS while ensuring that we include all characters from both strings appropriately.
- Finally, the constructed SCS is reversed since we constructed it backwards, and we return the result as a string.

This approach runs efficiently with time complexity of O(m*n) and space complexity of O(m*n) where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings.

# 1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves

### Problem Description 
We have a sequence of `books`: the `i`-th book has thickness `books[i][0]` and height `books[i][1]`.

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width `shelf_width`.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is `<= shelf_width`), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.


Example 1:
Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.

Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.


Constraints:
`1 <= books.length <= 1000`
`1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000`
`1 <= books[i][1] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of stacking books on shelves with the minimum total height, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to iterate over the books and at each book, determine whether to start a new shelf or to continue adding books on the current shelf.

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We will define an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` will represent the minimum height of the bookshelf containing the first `i` books.

2. **Initialization**: Set `dp[0] = 0`, which means no books on the shelf results in a height of zero.

3. **Iterate through each book**: For each book, we will check how many books can fit on the current shelf without exceeding the `shelf_width`. We keep track of the total thickness and the maximum height of the current shelf while we iteratively add books.

4. **Update the DP Array**: For each valid configuration of books on the current shelf, update the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the total number of books used. The height added to the total will be the maximum height of the books placed on that shelf.

5. **Final Result**: After processing all books, `dp[n]` gives the height of the bookshelf containing all books.

### Python Code

Here is the Python code following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def minHeightShelves(self, books: List[List[int]], shelf_width: int) -> int:
        n = len(books)
        # dp[i] means the minimum height of the bookshelf containing the first i books.
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # No book means no height
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_thickness = 0
            max_height = 0
            
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                total_thickness += books[j][0]
                
                if total_thickness > shelf_width:
                    break  # No need to continue if shelf width is exceeded
                
                max_height = max(max_height, books[j][1])
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + max_height)

        return dp[n]

# Example for testing
solution = Solution()
books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]]
shelf_width = 4
print(solution.minHeightShelves(books, shelf_width))  # Output: 6

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` with a method `minHeightShelves` that takes a list of books and the shelf width.
- **DP Initialization**: We initialize a DP array with size `n+1` (number of books) and set the first element to zero.
- **Double Loop**: We use two nested loops:
  - The outer loop (indexed `i`) iterates through the total number of books.
  - The inner loop (indexed `j`) checks from book `i-1` back to the first book, trying to fit as many books as possible on one shelf.
- **Thickness and Height Calculation**:
  - We keep accumulating the thickness of books until it exceeds the shelf width.
  - We update the maximum height of the books on the current shelf.
- **DP Update**: For each valid configuration of book placement, we update the DP value to find the minimum height achievable.
- **Return Result**: Finally, we return the height for all `n` books from `dp[n]`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is manageable within the given constraints (with `n` up to 1000).

# 1125. Smallest Sufficient Team

### Problem Description 
In a project, you have a list of required skills `req_skills`, and a list of people. The `ith` person `people[i]` contains a list of skills that the person has.

Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in `req_skills`, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.

For example, `team = [0, 1, 3]` represents the people with skills `people[0]`, `people[1]`, and `people[3]`.

Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in any order.

It is guaranteed an answer exists.


Example 1:
Input: req_skills = ["java","nodejs","reactjs"], people = [["java"],["nodejs"],["nodejs","reactjs"]]
Output: [0,2]

Example 2:
Input: req_skills = ["algorithms","math","java","reactjs","csharp","aws"], people = [["algorithms","math","java"],["algorithms","math","reactjs"],["java","csharp","aws"],["reactjs","csharp"],["csharp","math"],["aws","java"]]
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:
`1 <= req_skills.length <= 16`
`1 <= req_skills[i].length <= 16`
`req_skills[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

All the strings of `req_skills` are unique.

`1 <= people.length <= 60`
`0 <= people[i].length <= 16`
`1 <= people[i][j].length <= 16`
`people[i][j]` consists of lowercase English letters.

All the strings of `people[i]` are unique.

Every skill in `people[i]` is a skill in `req_skills`.

It is guaranteed a sufficient team exists.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of forming a sufficient team using the `req_skills` and the list of `people`, we can utilize a bitmask approach. This technique efficiently handles the combination of skills through integer bitwise operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Understanding the Input**:
   - We have a list `req_skills` indicating skills needed for the project.
   - Each person has their own list of skills.

2. **Representing Skills with Bitmask**:
   - We can represent the required skills and the skills of each person as integers using bitmasking:
     - Each skill corresponds to a bit position (e.g., if there are 5 skills, the skills can be represented by the 0-4 bits).
     - For example, if `req_skills` = ["java", "nodejs", "reactjs"], then "java" might correspond to the bit 0, "nodejs" to bit 1, and "reactjs" to bit 2.

3. **Generating the Skill Masks**:
   - We need to create a bitmask for the `req_skills` and for each person based on the skills they possess.

4. **Backtracking for Team Selection**:
   - We can implement a backtracking algorithm that explores combinations of people to find the minimum set whose skills cover all required skills.

5. **Handling the Output**:
   - The result should be a list of indices representing the people selected for the team.

### Implementation:
Here is the complete Python implementation of the above process that can be run directly on LeetCode.



```python
from typing import List
from itertools import combinations

class Solution:
    def smallestSufficientTeam(self, req_skills: List[str], people: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:
        skill_to_index = {skill: i for i, skill in enumerate(req_skills)}
        n = len(req_skills)
        m = len(people)
        
        # Create a skill mask for each person
        people_masks = [0] * m
        for i, person_skills in enumerate(people):
            for skill in person_skills:
                people_masks[i] |= 1 << skill_to_index[skill]

        # dp to store the minimum team to form each skill set
        dp = {0: []}  # starting with no skills needed
        
        for i in range(m):
            person_mask = people_masks[i]
            # Try to form new combinations of skills with the current person
            for skills_needed in list(dp.keys()):
                new_skills = skills_needed | person_mask
                if new_skills not in dp or len(dp[new_skills]) > len(dp[skills_needed]) + 1:
                    dp[new_skills] = dp[skills_needed] + [i]

        # The all_skills_mask corresponds to having all skills required
        all_skills_mask = (1 << n) - 1
        return dp[all_skills_mask]

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.smallestSufficientTeam(
    ["java", "nodejs", "reactjs"], 
    [["java"], ["nodejs"], ["nodejs", "reactjs"]]
))  # Outputs: [0, 2]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Mapping Skills**: We create a dictionary that maps each skill to its corresponding bit index.
2. **Creating Masks**: We generate a mask for each person based on the skills they possess.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a dictionary `dp` to store the minimum team needed for each possible combination of skills (represented as an integer bitmask).
4. **Updating Combinations**: For each person, we iteratively combine their skills with existing skill combinations to see if we can form a more efficient team.
5. **Final Result**: At the end, we access the team configuration that covers all required skills (`all_skills_mask`), and we return the indices of the people in that team.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimal sufficient team with respect to combinations of skills.

# 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

### Problem Description 
Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:
Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
The values of `arr` correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \
  12   4        6    8
 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4

Constraints:
`2 <= arr.length <= 40`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 15`
It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than `2^31`).

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the smallest possible sum of values of non-leaf nodes in a binary tree constructed from an array of positive integers, we will use a dynamic programming approach. The main idea is that we can recursively calculate the minimum cost of constructing the tree for different segments of the array and memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's how we approach this problem:

1. **Understand the structure**: For an array where elements represent the leaves of the tree, we can create a binary tree such that:
   - Each non-leaf node's value is equal to the product of the largest leaf in the left subtree and the largest leaf in the right subtree.
   - We need to find partitions of the array into left and right subtrees and compute their costs.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a DP table `dp[i][j]` to hold the minimum sum of all non-leaf nodes for the subarray `arr[i:j+1]`.

3. **Base Case**: The base case is when the subarray has 1 element, in which case the cost is 0 since there are no non-leaf nodes.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each possible partition in the array (for each `k` between `i` and `j`):
     - The left subtree’s minimum cost is `dp[i][k]`,
     - The right subtree's minimum cost is `dp[k+1][j]`,
     - The product contributing to the non-leaf node is the product of the maximum elements of left and right subtrees.
   - We take the minimum across all `k`.

5. **Implementation**: Below is the implementation of the described strategy in Python that is compatible with the LeetCode environment.

Here's the code:



```python
class Solution:
    def mctFromLeafValues(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        # Initialize the dp table
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Precompute the maximums in each segment to avoid redundant calculations
        max_values = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            max_values[i][i] = arr[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                max_values[i][j] = max(max_values[i][j - 1], arr[j])
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for length in range(2, n + 1): # length of the current subarray
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')  # Start with infinity for minimization
                # Try to split at every possible position
                for k in range(i, j):
                    cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + max_values[i][k] * max_values[k + 1][j]
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], cost)
        
        return dp[0][n - 1]


```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `mctFromLeafValues` which takes an input list `arr`.
- We initialize a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum sum of non-leaf nodes for elements from index `i` to `j`.
- We also prepare a `max_values` 2D table that stores the maximum element for every possible subarray. This helps in efficiently calculating the product without recalculating maximums.
- The double loop iterates over all subarrays of length 2 to `n`. The innermost loop checks every possible partition `k` and calculates the cost for each partition, updating the minimum cost in `dp[i][j]`.
- Finally, we return `dp[0][n-1]` which contains the answer for the entire array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3) and will work efficiently within the problem's constraints.

# 1136. Parallel Courses

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer `n` which indicates that we have `n` courses, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [a, b]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `a` and course `b`: course `a` has to be studied before course `b`.

In one semester, you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses. If there is no way to study all the courses, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: In the first semester, courses 1 and 2 are studied. In the second semester, course 3 is studied.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No course can be studied because they depend on each other.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 5000`
`1 <= relations.length <= 5000`
`1 <= a, b <= n`
`a != b`
All the pairs `[a, b]` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of semesters needed to study all the courses given the prerequisite relationships, we can utilize graph theory concepts, specifically topological sorting. We will represent the courses and their relationships as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Below is the solution using Python, including a detailed explanation.

### Python Code



```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def minNumberOfSemesters(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create adjacency list and calculate in-degrees of each course
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)  # in_degree[i] is the number of prerequisites for course i
        
        for a, b in relations:
            graph[a].append(b)
            in_degree[b] += 1
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a queue with courses that have no prerequisites
        queue = deque()
        for course in range(1, n + 1):
            if in_degree[course] == 0:
                queue.append(course)
        
        # Step 3: Track the semesters and the number of courses taken
        semesters = 0
        courses_taken = 0
        
        while queue:
            # We can take all those available courses in the current semester
            courses_this_semester = len(queue)
            semesters += 1
            
            for _ in range(courses_this_semester):
                course = queue.popleft()
                courses_taken += 1
                
                # Decrease the in-degree for courses that depend on the current course
                for neighbor in graph[course]:
                    in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
                    # If in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue
                    if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                        queue.append(neighbor)

        # Step 4: Check if we managed to take all courses
        return semesters if courses_taken == n else -1

```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**: We're creating a directed graph using an adjacency list where each course points to the courses that depend on it. We also maintain an array `in_degree` to track how many prerequisites each course has.

2. **Queue Initialization**: We initialize a queue with all the courses that can be taken immediately, i.e., those with an `in_degree` of `0`.

3. **Processing the Queue**: We process the queue in a while loop:
   - Count the number of courses that can be taken in the current semester (`courses_this_semester`).
   - Increment the `semesters` counter for each set of courses taken in one go.
   - For each course taken, check its neighbors (dependent courses) and decrement their in-degrees. If any neighbor's in-degree becomes `0`, it means all its prerequisites are satisfied, so we add it to the queue.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all possible courses, we check if the number of courses taken equals `n`. If it does, we return the total number of semesters; otherwise, we return `-1` to indicate that it’s not possible to take all courses due to circular dependencies.

### Performance
This algorithm runs in O(n + m) time complexity, where `n` is the number of courses and `m` is the number of prerequisite relationships, making it efficient and suitable for the problem's constraints. The space complexity is O(n + m) for storing the graph and in-degrees.
