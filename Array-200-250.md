# 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points

### Problem Description 
On a 2D plane, there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by `points`.

You can move according to these rules:
In `1` second, you can either:
	
move vertically by one unit,
move horizontally by one unit, or
move diagonally `sqrt(2)` units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in `1` second).

You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.


Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`points.length == n`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`points[i].length == 2`
`-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 The main strategy to solve this problem involves understanding the optimal way to move from one point to another in the shortest time possible given the three types of moves allowed (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

For each move from a point `points[i]` to `points[i+1]`, consider the differences in x and y coordinates:
- let `dx = abs(points[i+1][0] - points[i][0])`
- let `dy = abs(points[i+1][1] - points[i][1])`

The optimal number of moves is dictated by `max(dx, dy)`. This is because if you move diagonally, you reduce both the x and y differences by 1 each time. Once either dx or dy becomes zero (i.e., you are aligned either horizontally or vertically with the destination point), you continue to move either horizontally or vertically, consuming exactly one second per step.

Hereâ€™s Python code implemented in the style suitable for submission and testing on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        time = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            # Calculate the absolute difference of x and y coordinates
            dx = abs(points[i][0] - points[i-1][0])
            dy = abs(points[i][1] - points[i-1][1])
            
            # The minimum time to go from point[i-1] to point[i]
            time += max(dx, dy)
        
        return time

# Example to run directly within LeetCode or in a local environment after importing List from typing:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.minTimeToVisitAllPoints([[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]))  # Output: 7

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `time = 0`.

2. **Iterate through points**: For each pair of consecutive points, we calculate:
   - `dx`: absolute difference in x coordinates.
   - `dy`: absolute difference in y coordinates.
   - We then increment `time` by `max(dx, dy)`. This accounts for the maximum of either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal moves necessary to reach from one point to the next.

3. **Return the Total Time**: After iterating through all the given points, the `time` variable contains the total minimum seconds required, which is then returned.

This solution covers all aspects of the provided problem, utilizing O(n) time complexity where `n` is the number of points. It handles the constraints efficiently and should perform well within the given limits.

# 1267. Count Servers that Communicate

### Problem Description 
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m * n` integer matrix `grid`, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[1,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three servers can communicate with at least one other server.


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other. The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other. The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with any other server.


Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m <= 250`
`1 <= n <= 250`
`grid[i][j] == 0 or 1`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to determine how many servers communicate with at least one other server. A server communicates with another server if they are either in the same row or the same column. We can approach this problem by counting the number of servers in each row and each column first, and then checking each server to see if it can communicate with another server.

Here's an outline of the steps:

1. **Count Servers**: Create two arrays, `rows` and `cols`, to store the number of servers in each row and each column, respectively.
  
2. **Check Communication**: Iterate over each cell in the grid. For each server (`grid[i][j] == 1`), check if the total number of servers in its row (`rows[i]`) or its column (`cols[j]`) is more than 1. If yes, it can communicate with another server.

3. **Sum Up Communicating Servers**: For each server that can communicate, add to the count of communicating servers.

Here is the Python code implementing the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def countServers(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        rows = [0] * m
        cols = [0] * n
        
        # First pass: Count number of servers in each row and column
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    rows[i] += 1
                    cols[j] += 1
        
        count = 0
        # Second pass: Count servers that can communicate with others
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1 and (rows[i] > 1 or cols[j] > 1):
                    count += 1
        
        return count


```

In this code:
- `rows[i]` records the number of servers in the `i`-th row.
- `cols[j]` records the number of servers in the `j`-th column.
- We take two passes over the grid:
  - In the first pass, we just count the number of servers in each row and column.
  - In the second pass, we check for each server if there are any other servers in the same row or column, indicating that it can communicate.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this method is O(m*n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we traverse every element twice in the worst case.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(m+n), due to the extra space used by the `rows` and `cols` to store counts for rows and columns.
This solution should work efficiently given the constraints and provides a systematic approach to solve the problem as desired for a typical competitive programming or coding interview scenario.


# 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game

### Problem Description 
Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").

The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.

"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.

The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.

The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.

No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given an array `moves` where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that `moves` is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first.


Example 1:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: "A" wins, he always plays first.

"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " X "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OOX"

Example 2:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: "B" wins.

"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XXO"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "XO " 
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "O  "

Example 3:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.

"XXO"
"OOX"
"XOX"

Example 4:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: "Pending"
Explanation: The game has not finished yet.

"X  "
" O "
"   "

Constraints:
`1 <= moves.length <= 9`
`moves[i].length == 2`
`0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2`
There are no repeated elements on `moves`.

`moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.

### Solution 
 Here is a Python implementation that solves the given Tic-Tac-Toe problem:



```python
class Solution:
    def tictactoe(self, moves: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        # Initialize the board (3x3 grid)
        board = [[None] * 3 for _ in range(3)]
        
        # Helper function to check if a player has won
        def is_winner(player):
            # Check rows and columns
            for i in range(3):
                if all(board[i][j] == player for j in range(3)) or \
                   all(board[j][i] == player for j in range(3)):
                    return True
            # Check diagonals
            if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] == player or \
               board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] == player:
                return True
            return False
        
        # Fill the board with the moves
        for index, (row, col) in enumerate(moves):
            player = "X" if index % 2 == 0 else "O"
            board[row][col] = player
        
        # Determine the result
        if is_winner("X"):
            return "A"  # First player wins
        if is_winner("O"):
            return "B"  # Second player wins
        if len(moves) == 9:
            return "Draw"  # All slots filled
        return "Pending"  # Game not finished

# Example of usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.tictactoe([[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]))  # Output: "A"
# print(sol.tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]))  # Output: "B"
# print(sol.tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]))  # Output: "Draw"
# print(sol.tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1]]))  # Output: "Pending"

```

Explanation:
- The `board` is initialized as a 3x3 grid with all slots set to `None`.
- A nested function `is_winner(player)` checks if a player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- We process the `moves` list and alternate placing "X" and "O" on the `board` according to the player's turn.
- After updating the board for each move, we check if either player has won using the `is_winner` function.
- If "X" (A) has three in a row, we return "A". If "O" (B) has three in a row, we return "B".
- If all moves are played (size is 9) and there's no winner, the game is a "Draw".
- If none of the above conditions meet, the game is "Pending" as there are still spots left to play.

# 1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones

### Problem Description 
Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.


Example 1:
Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.

There are 4 squares of side 2.

There is  1 square of side 3.

Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.


Example 2:
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 300`
`1 <= arr[0].length <= 300`
`0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the number of square submatrices with all ones, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a new matrix `dp` of the same size as the input `matrix` where each `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square submatrix having all ones that ends at cell `(i, j)`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the approach:

1. If `matrix[i][j]` is `1`, then `dp[i][j]` can be determined by looking at the minimum value of `dp` at `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`, and adding 1 to it. This is because the current cell can extend a square by 1 if the squares ending at these three positions can themselves be extended by the cell `matrix[i][j]`.
2. If `matrix[i][j]` is `0`, then `dp[i][j]` is `0` because a 0 cannot be a part of any submatrix of all ones.
3. Initialize the first row and first column of `dp` to be the same as `matrix` since any `(i, 0)` or `(0, j)` can only form a square of side 1 if `matrix[i][0]` or `matrix[0][j]` is 1.
4. The sum of all values in `dp` gives the number of all squares of all sizes.

The following is the implementation in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0
        
        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        total_squares = 0
        
        # Iterate through each cell of the matrix
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                else:
                    if i == 0 or j == 0:
                        # First row or first column
                        dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j]
                    else:
                        # Update dp[i][j]
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                # Accumulate the total number of squares
                total_squares += dp[i][j]
        
        return total_squares

```

This code will effectively calculate the number of square submatrices filled with all ones. The use of dynamic programming optimizes the solution to run in O(m * n) time complexity where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns, which is necessary given the input constraints can be quite large (`m` and `n` up to 300).

# 1287. Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time.

Return that integer.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
Output: 6

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
`0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 The problem requires finding the integer that appears more than 25% of the time in a sorted non-decreasing array. Due to the sort constraint, the task can be efficiently tackled using linear counting or binary search methods.

By observing the 25% condition, the element satisfying this must occur more than `n * 0.25` times in the list where `n` is the length of the list. In the sorted list, you can simply iterate over the list to count occurrences or leverage the property of sorted arrays to implement a faster check using binary search.

### Solution using Binary Search

Given the sorted nature of the array, binary search can determine the first and last position of an element efficiently. If we know the positions, we can easily count how many times an element appears and check if it satisfies the condition (greater than `n//4`, where `//` is integer division).

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of steps using binary search:
1. Iterate over elements of the array.
2. For each unique element (using a binary search), find its first and last positions.
3. Compute the count of the element.
4. If the count is more than `n//4`, we found our answer.

We can improve efficiency by skipping the binary searches for elements we've already considered.

Here's the Python code:



```python
from typing import List
import bisect

class Solution:
    def findSpecialInteger(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        threshold = n // 4
        
        # We can sample a few elements because the array is sorted, 
        # the repeated element must be at one of these positions to satisfy the condition.
        elements_to_check = [arr[i * n // 4] for i in range(4)]
        for x in elements_to_check:
            # These are safe operations because x is guaranteed to be in the array from the selected positions
            left_idx = bisect.bisect_left(arr, x)
            right_idx = bisect.bisect_right(arr, x) - 1
            
            if right_idx - left_idx + 1 > threshold:
                return x
        
        # As per problem statement, we know there MUST be an element that meets the condition, 
        # so this line should theoretically never execute.
        return -1
        
# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.findSpecialInteger([1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10])) # Output: 6

```

### Explanation
- **Bisect**: Pythonâ€™s `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` provide an efficient way to find the first and last positions of a given element in a sorted array.
- **Elements to check**: Since one value must occur more than 25% of the time, for computational efficiency, it's only necessary to check certain strategic points in the array. Specifically, checking the element at every `n//4` position ensures coverage of possible candidates.
- **Threshold**: Determines the minimal count required for the element to be the answer, which is calculated as one more than a quarter of the list size.

### Runtime & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves a few binary searches amounting to O(log n). Since weâ€™re ensuring just a few elements are checked (at most 4), this leads to an effective complexity of O(log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# 1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold

### Problem Description 
Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`. Return the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to `threshold` or return 0 if there is no such square.


Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], threshold = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum side length of square with sum less than 4 is 2 as shown.


Example 2:
Input: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2]], threshold = 1
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], threshold = 6
Output: 3

Example 4:
Input: mat = [[18,70],[61,1],[25,85],[14,40],[11,96],[97,96],[63,45]], threshold = 40184
Output: 2

Constraints:
`1 <= m, n <= 300`
`m == mat.length`
`n == mat[i].length`
`0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10000`
`0 <= threshold <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum side-length of a square where the sum of its elements is less than or equal to a given threshold. A brute-force approach would be too slow given the problem constraints, hence we utilize a more efficient method involving prefix sums and binary search.

### Strategy:

1. **Prefix Sum**:
   - Construct a prefix sum matrix `sum` where `sum[i][j]` denotes the sum of elements from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i,j) in matrix `mat`. This approach allows calculating the sum of any submatrix in constant time.

2. **Binary Search on Side Length**:
   - Use binary search on the possible side length values from 1 to min(m, n). For each mid value in binary search, check if a square of side `mid` exists with a sum less than or equal to the threshold using the prefix sum matrix.

3. **Checking Squares**:
   - For a given side length `size`, a function checks every possible square of this size. Having constructed the prefix sum matrix, for any bottom-right corner (i, j) of the square, it gets the sum of that square in O(1) time and determines if it's within the threshold.

### Python Code:


```python
class Solution:
    def maxSideLength(self, mat: List[List[int]], threshold: int) -> int:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        
        # Create prefix sum array
        sum = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                sum[i][j] = mat[i-1][j-1] + sum[i-1][j] + sum[i][j-1] - sum[i-1][j-1]
        
        # Helper function to check if a square of given size can fit within the threshold
        def canFit(size):
            for i in range(size, m + 1):
                for j in range(size, n + 1):
                    total = sum[i][j] - sum[i-size][j] - sum[i][j-size] + sum[i-size][j-size]
                    if total <= threshold:
                        return True
            return False

        # Binary search on side length of the square
        left, right = 0, min(m, n)
        max_length = 0
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if canFit(mid):
                max_length = mid  # Update answer if fit
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return max_length

# Proposed code can be pasted and run directly on LeetCode. 

```

### Explanation:
- **Prefix Sum Construction**: Time complexity is O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix.
- **Binary Search**:
    - Since `mid` ranges between 1 and min(m, n), this step involves log(min(m, n)) iterations.
    - In each iteration, the `canFit` check runs in O(m*n) for verifying every possible square in worst case.
- Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(m*n*log(min(m,n))), which is efficient enough given the problem's constraints.


# 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 500`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 Here is the Python code that solves the problem according to the specification and requirements outlined above. This solution iterates through the list of integers, converts each integer to a string to determine its length, and counts those with an even length. The code utilizes basic Python functionalities making it easy to understand and efficient to run for the given constraints.



```python
class Solution:
    def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            # Convert the number to a string and check if its length is even
            if len(str(num)) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        return count

# The following are examples to demonstrate how to use the class and its method

# Example 1
nums1 = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]
sol1 = Solution()
output1 = sol1.findNumbers(nums1)
print(output1)  # Output: 2, Explanation: `12` and `7896` have even number of digits.

# Example 2
nums2 = [555, 901, 482, 1771]
sol2 = Solution()
output2 = sol2.findNumbers(nums2)
print(output2)  # Output: 1, Explanation: Only `1771` has an even number of digits.

```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Method Signature**: The method `findNumbers` is a member of the class `Solution`. It takes a list of integers (`List[int]`) as an argument and returns an integer.

2. **Count Initializer**: A variable `count` is initialized to zero. This variable will store the count of numbers having an even number of digits.

3. **Loop Through the List**: The method iterates through each number in the input list `nums`.

4. **Digit Counting**: For each number, the method:
    - Converts the number to a string using `str(num)`.
    - Checks if the length of this string (number of digits in the number) is even by checking `len(str(num)) % 2 == 0`.

5. **Count Increment**: If the condition is true (even number of digits), the `count` is incremented by one.

6. **Return**: After the loop completes, the method returns the `count` which now reflects the number of integers with an even number of digits.

### Constraints Satisfaction
- The loop effectively processes up to 500 integers (as `1 <= nums.length <= 500`).
- Each integer is within the range defined (`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`), and is efficiently handled by Pythonâ€™s `int` and `str` functionalities.

Given that the operations inside the loop are constant time operations, the overall complexity is O(n) where n is the number of integers in `nums`. This solution is efficient and should work well within the provided constraints.

# 1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find whether it's possible to divide this array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers
Return `True` if it is possible. Otherwise, return `False`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].


Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,3,4,3,4,5,9,10,11], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3] , [2,3,4] , [3,4,5] and [9,10,11].


Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3,2,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Each array should be divided in subarrays of size 3.


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
Note: This question is the same as 846: https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/

### Solution 
 Below is the Python code to solve the described problem using a greedy algorithm. The solution involves sorting the input array and keeping track of counts using a hashtable.



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isPossibleDivide(self, nums, k):
        if len(nums) % k != 0:
            return False
        
        num_count = Counter(nums)
        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)

        for num in nums_sorted:
            if num_count[num] > 0:
                for i in range(k):
                    next_num = num + i
                    if num_count[next_num] > 0:
                        num_count[next_num] -= 1
                    else:
                        return False
        return True

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Check for Immediate Rejection**: First, the solution checks if the total number of elements (`len(nums)`) in the array is divisible by `k`. If it is not divisible, it immediately returns `False` since it's impossible to split the array into subarrays of equal size `k`.

2. **Use Counting for Efficient Access**: The code utilizes Python's `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the array. This allows efficient access and modifications as we try to form consecutive subsequences.

3. **Sort and Process Each Element**: 
   - We start by sorting the numbers.
   - For each number in the sorted array, if that number has not yet been fully used (`num_count[num] > 0`), we attempt to create a sequence starting from this number.
   - For each of the `k` numbers starting from `num`, we check if it exists in the count map (`num_count`). If it does, we decrement the count (indicating we've used one occurrence of that number to form part of a consecutive sequence).
   - If any required number in the sequence of `k` numbers doesn't have a non-zero count left, the function returns `False`, indicating it's impossible to split the array as required.

4. **Successfully Found All Subarrays**: If the loops conclude without finding any issue, return `True`.

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to sorting where `N` is the number of items in `nums`. The remaining lookups and adjustments are generally efficient due to the use of the hash map, contributing an additional O(N) complexity resulting in overall O(N log N).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) due to the storage used by the `Counter (num_count)` and the sorted list `nums_sorted` in the worst case scenario.

This solution adheres to the constraints and efficiently handles arrays with length up to 10^5. You can paste this code directly under a LeetCode problem with ID 846 for validation.

# 1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side

### Problem Description 
Given an array `arr`, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with `-1`.

After doing so, return the array.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
Explanation: 
- index 0 --> the greatest element to the right of index 0 is index 1 (18).

- index 1 --> the greatest element to the right of index 1 is index 4 (6).

- index 2 --> the greatest element to the right of index 2 is index 4 (6).

- index 3 --> the greatest element to the right of index 3 is index 4 (6).

- index 4 --> the greatest element to the right of index 4 is index 5 (1).

- index 5 --> there are no elements to the right of index 5, so we put -1.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [400]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There are no elements to the right of index 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 104`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can adopt a right-to-left traversal strategy because we want the maximum element to the right for each position. By iterating from the right-most element to the left-most element, we can keep track of the greatest element we have seen so far, and use that information to populate our result.

This approach is efficient as it allows us to solve the problem in a single pass through the array, yielding a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` of the same length as `arr` and fill it with zeroes (or use another method eg. list comprehension to create an equivalent setup).
2. Start from the last element in the array. Set the last element in the `result` array to `-1`, as specified.
3. Track the maximum value seen so far as you iterate from right to left. Let's call this `max_right`.
4. For each element `arr[i]` from the end to the start:
   - Update `result[i]` with the current maximum `max_right`.
   - Update `max_right` to be the maximum of `max_right` and `arr[i]`.
5. By the end of this process, `result` will be populated with the desired values.

The detailed and direct solution based on this plan is presented below.



```python
class Solution:
    def replaceElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(arr)
        result = [-1] * n  # All elements initially set to -1
        
        # Start from the last but one element to the first (since last is always -1)
        max_right = arr[-1]  # Start with the last element as initial max for the second last element
        
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            result[i] = max_right
            max_right = max(max_right, arr[i])
        
        return result

```

This solution starts by considering the second-to-last element moving towards the first element, as the last element is always set to `-1`. For each element `i`, it sets the maximum value observed so far from the right. After setting `result[i]`, it updates the `max_right` value to include the current element so that it can be considered for the next iterations. This keeps the memory requirements to O(1) (aside from the output list) and the performance linear in terms of the number of operations, making it well-suited for even large inputs as guaranteed by the problem's constraint.

You can run the function above directly on the LeetCode platform by just copying and pasting it as it assumes the LeetCode prior declaration of `List` from `typing` and the problem setup where `arr` is an input to the function `replaceElements`.

# 1300. Sum of Mutated Array Closest to Target

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `arr` and a target value `target`, return the integer `value` such that when we change all the integers larger than `value` in the given array to be equal to `value`, the sum of the array gets as close as possible (in absolute difference) to `target`.

In case of a tie, return the minimum such integer.

Notice that the answer is not neccesarilly a number from `arr`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [4,9,3], target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: When using 3 arr converts to [3, 3, 3] which sums 9 and that's the optimal answer.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,3,5], target = 10
Output: 5

Example 3:
Input: arr = [60864,25176,27249,21296,20204], target = 56803
Output: 11361

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
`1 <= arr[i], target <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, the approach involves finding a value `x` such that the difference between the sum of the modified version of array `arr` where all elements greater than `x` are replaced by `x` and the `target` is minimized. The essence of the problem is to minimize the absolute difference between `target` and the arrayâ€™s sum when modified by a possible value `x`.

We can approach this problem using binary search. The minimum possible value of `value` could be the minimum in the array, and the maximum possible value could be the maximum in the array. However, to cover possibilities outside these bounds, the range can extend from `1` to `max(arr)`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of our approach:

1. Define a function `calculate_sum(value)` which will replace all elements in `arr` that are greater than `value` with `value` and return the sum of the modified array.
2. Implement a binary search on `value` from `1` to `max(arr)`. For each `value`, compute the `modified sum` using `calculate_sum`.
3. Throughout the binary search, keep track of the smallest absolute difference between `modified sum` and `target`. Update the optimal `value` in case of finding a smaller difference or a tie with a smaller `value`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def findBestValue(self, arr: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def calculate_sum(value):
            return sum(min(x, value) for x in arr)

        # Define the binary search range
        left, right = 0, max(arr)
        min_diff, best_value = float('inf'), -1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            current_sum = calculate_sum(mid)
            
            # Calculate current difference and update best_value if better
            current_diff = abs(current_sum - target)
            if current_diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = current_diff
                best_value = mid
            elif current_diff == min_diff:
                # Favor smaller value in case of tie
                best_value = min(best_value, mid)
                
            # Binary search adjustment
            if current_sum < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        return best_value


```

This `Solution` class and the `findBestValue` method can be directly submitted on LeetCode. By adjusting the binary search range `(left, right)` and calculating sum in the helper `calculate_sum(value)`, the method determines the optimal `value` minimizing the absolute difference with the `target`.

# 1304. Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`, return any array containing `n` unique integers such that they add up to `0`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: [-7,-1,1,3,4]
Explanation: These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].


Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: [-1,0,1]

Example 3:
Input: n = 1
Output: [0]

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of returning an array containing `n` unique integers that add up to 0, we can adopt a straightforward method by utilizing symmetry. Specifically, the array can be constructed by balancing positive and negative integers for any positive integer `i`, and ensuring their sum is zero. Notably, we can consider the following steps:

1. For even values of `n`, simply use integers from `1` to `n/2` and their negative counterparts.
2. For odd values of `n`, along with the even approach, include `0` in the array.

Let's break down the algorithm:

- Implement a list comprehension or loop that generates numbers from `1` to `n//2` and then adds their negative counterparts.
- If `n` is odd, add `0` to the list to balance out the sum to be zero while ensuring uniqueness.

The code implementation following this logic is direct and efficient with a time complexity of O(n). This algorithm is viable since it adheres to the given constraint 1 <= n <= 1000. Hereâ€™s how this can be implemented:



```python
class Solution:
    def sumZero(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        # We initialize an empty list
        result = []
        
        # If n is odd, we start by adding zero
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result.append(0)
        
        # Populate the list from 1 to n//2 and add both i and -i
        for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
            result.extend([i, -i])
        
        return result

```

Explanation of the implementation:
- We define a class `Solution` with method `sumZero` which takes an integer `n` and returns a list of integers.
- The list `result` is initialized to gather our results.
- We check if `n` is odd (using `n % 2 == 1`). If it is, we append `0` to our result list since for an odd count, a zero is necessary to balance the array to sum zero.
- We loop from `1` to `n//2` (integer division), for each number `i`, we append `i` and `-i` to the list. This ensures symmetrically placed numbers negating each otherâ€™s sum.
- Finally, the `result` list is returned which contains `n` unique integers summing to zero.

This code should execute efficiently on the LeetCode platform for given constraints.

# 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

### Problem Description 
We are given a list `nums` of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`).  For each such pair, there are `freq` elements with value `val` concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].

The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].

At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,3]

Constraints:
`2 <= nums.length <= 100`
`nums.length % 2 == 0`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution to the described problem written to be compliant with LeetCode's submission format. The task involves decoding a list using a run-length encoding technique and producing the decompressed list based on the information given.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation with an explanation:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def decompressRLElist(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        decompressed = []  # This will hold the final decompressed list.
        
        for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):  # Iterate over `nums` in steps of 2.
            freq = nums[i]   # First element of the pair represents frequency.
            val = nums[i+1]  # Second element of the pair represents value.

            # We extend the `decompressed` list by repeating the `val` by `freq` times.
            decompressed.extend([val] * freq)
        
        return decompressed
    
# Example function calls for testing (these lines would be omitted on LeetCode):
sol = Solution()
print(sol.decompressRLElist([1,2,3,4]))  # Output: [2, 4, 4, 4]
print(sol.decompressRLElist([1,1,2,3]))  # Output: [1, 3, 3]

```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: We define a method `decompressRLElist`, which takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a list of integers. This is consistent with the expected function signature on LeetCode.

2. **Decompressed List Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `decompressed`, which will collect the fully expanded elements based on the `nums` input list.

3. **Loop Through `nums`**: Since our encoding pairs are organized consecutively (`freq`, `val`), we loop through `nums` in steps of 2 (`range(0, len(nums), 2)`). This way, `nums[i]` gives us frequency (`freq`) and `nums[i + 1]` directly gives us the value (`val`).

4. **Generate Repetitions**: For each pair, we use Python's list multiplication (`[val] * freq`) to generate a sublist with `freq` instances of `val`. We then `extend` the `decompressed` list with this generated sublist.

This solution completely constructs the decompressed list in a straightforward manner using Python list operations, and should perform efficiently within the provided constraints. The use of `.extend()` helps in adding elements to the list without creating unnecessary intermediate lists, maintaining optimal use of space.

# 1329. Sort the Matrix Diagonally

### Problem Description 
A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the matrix diagonal starting from `mat[2][0]`, where `mat` is a `6 x 3` matrix, includes cells `mat[2][0]`, `mat[3][1]`, and `mat[4][2]`.

Given an `m x n` matrix `mat` of integers, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.


Example 1:
Input: mat = [[3,3,1,1],[2,2,1,2],[1,1,1,2]]
Output: [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[1,2,3,3]]

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[11,25,66,1,69,7],[23,55,17,45,15,52],[75,31,36,44,58,8],[22,27,33,25,68,4],[84,28,14,11,5,50]]
Output: [[5,17,4,1,52,7],[11,11,25,45,8,69],[14,23,25,44,58,15],[22,27,31,36,50,66],[84,28,75,33,55,68]]

Constraints:
`m == mat.length`
`n == mat[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 100`
`1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of sorting each matrix diagonal in ascending order, we can adopt the following approach:

1. Identify each diagonal in the matrix. Diagonals can be identified by the starting cells which are found on the top row and the leftmost column of the matrix.
2. For each diagonal starting cell, traverse the diagonal and collect all the elements into a list.
3. Sort each list of diagonal elements.
4. Reassign the sorted elements back to their respective positions in the matrix diagonally.
5. Return the modified matrix.

This approach ensures all elements in a diagonal are collected, sorted, and placed back efficiently. Each diagonal can be uniquely identified by the offset from the first column (for diagonals starting from the first row) and the offset from the first row (for diagonals starting from the first column). 

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def diagonalSort(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        
        def sort_diagonal(i, j):
            # Collect the diagonal elements
            diag = []
            x, y = i, j
            while x < m and y < n:
                diag.append(mat[x][y])
                x += 1
                y += 1
            
            # Sort the diagonal elements
            diag.sort()
            
            # Replace diagonal elements with sorted ones
            for index, value in enumerate(diag):
                mat[i + index][j + index] = value
        
        # Sort all diagonals that start from the first row
        for j in range(n):
            sort_diagonal(0, j)
        
        # Sort all diagonals that start from the first column, except the top-left cell diagonal,
        # as it's already included in the above loop
        for i in range(1, m):
            sort_diagonal(i, 0)
        
        return mat

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
input_matrix = [[11,25,66,1,69,7],[23,55,17,45,15,52],[75,31,36,44,58,8],[22,27,33,25,68,4],[84,28,14,11,5,50]]
output_matrix = sol.diagonalSort(input_matrix)
print(output_matrix)

```

### Explanation:
1. The `sort_diagonal` function collects elements from a given starting cell (i, j) moving diagonally to the bottom-right, sorts them, and places the sorted values back to their original positions.
2. The solution then iterates over each possible starting position of the diagonals:
   - From each cell in the top row (`for j in range(n)`).
   - From each cell in the leftmost column (`for i in range(1, m)`), skipping the top-left cell diagonal as it's already considered.
3. The output from this code, given the initial matrix, will reflect each diagonal sorted individually while other elements in the matrix remain unchanged (as they pertain to their respective diagonals). 

This solution operates within the constraints and effectively handles the task by modifying the matrix in-place.

# 1330. Reverse Subarray To Maximize Array Value

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums`. The value of this array is defined as the sum of `|nums[i]-nums[i+1]|` for all `0 <= i < nums.length-1`.

You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You can perform this operation only once.

Find maximum possible value of the final array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: By reversing the subarray [3,1,5] the array becomes [2,5,1,3,4] whose value is 10.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,4,9,24,2,1,10]
Output: 68

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 3*10^4`
`-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 Here is a Python code solution to the problem described:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxValueAfterReverse(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total, res, min2, max2 = 0, 0, float('inf'), -float('inf')
        for a, b in zip(nums, nums[1:]):
            total += abs(a - b)
            res = max(res, abs(nums[0] - b) - abs(a - b))
            res = max(res, abs(nums[-1] - a) - abs(a - b))
            min2 = min(min2, max(a, b))
            max2 = max(max2, min(a, b))
        return total + max(res, (max2 - min2) * 2)

```

### Explanation:

The main goal is to find the maximum possible value of the final array after potentially reversing one subarray, calculated as the sum of absolute differences `|nums[i] - nums[i+1]|` for all `0 <= i < nums.length-1`.

For solution efficiency, the approach leverages:
1. The initial "value" calculation of the array without any operations.
2. Evaluation of potential maximum increase in this value by performing a single reversal operation on any subarray.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:
- **Initial Calculation**: Compute the sum of all `|nums[i] - nums[i+1]|` for the initial configuration to establish the baseline.
- **Gains from Reversing Edges**:
  - Consider reversing a subarray starting from index `0` up to some `j > 0`. The gain can be obtained by changing the connection from `nums[0]` directly to `nums[j+1]`, hence comparing it with `abs(nums[0] - nums[j+1]) - abs(nums[j] - nums[j+1])`.
  - Similarly, consider reversing a subarray from some index `i` to the end (`len(nums) - 1`). The effect is considered by `abs(nums[len(nums)-1] - nums[i-1]) - abs(nums[i] - nums[i-1])`.
- **Overall Gains Along the Array**:
  - Consideration is also given to reversing any subarray within the middle segments not touching endpoints. The difference given by reversing such a segment can maximize the change observed when swapping elements `(a,b) -> (b,a)`. For such internal segments, the gains are analyzed by looking at potential new maximum difference involving the extremes of the segment (maximum element encountered before a minimum in traversal and vice versa).
- **Combination of Results**:
  - Calculate the final maximum possible value by taking the original 'static' total and adding the maximum observed gain from the possible operations discussed.

This solution ensures we are working efficiently considering the constraints, using a linear scan approach to compute possible gains across the list and adjusting accordingly, without the need for nested iterations over subarrays. The logic for adjusting the sum based on internal segment reversal revolves around tracking the 'boundary' values in the array that would yield the largest difference increase when leveraged.

# 1331. Rank Transform of an Array

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:
Rank is an integer starting from 1.

The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.

Rank should be as small as possible.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [40,10,20,30]
Output: [4,1,2,3]
Explanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [100,100,100]
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation: Same elements share the same rank.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [37,12,28,9,100,56,80,5,12]
Output: [5,3,4,2,8,6,7,1,3]

Constraints:
`0 <= arr.length <= 105`
`-109 <= arr[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the provided problem, we need to map each unique integer in the input list to its rank, then replace each integer in the list with its corresponding rank. The rank of an integer is determined by its position in the sorted order of unique integers from the list, starting from 1.

The steps to achieve the solution are:
1. Sort the unique elements of the input list.
2. Create a dictionary to store each unique integer along with its corresponding rank.
3. Replace every integer in the input list with its rank using the dictionary.

Let's implement this in Python code:



```python
class Solution:
    def arrayRankTransform(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if not arr:
            return arr
        
        # Step 1: Sort the unique elements of the array
        sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr))
        
        # Step 2: Create a dictionary to map each value to its rank
        rank_dict = {value: index + 1 for index, value in enumerate(sorted_unique)}
        
        # Step 3: Replace each element in arr with its rank
        result = [rank_dict[value] for value in arr]
        
        return result

```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `arrayRankTransform` which takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of ranks as output. The method creates a sorted list of unique values from the input list, creates a rank dictionary with these values, and then uses a list comprehension to map each value in the original list to its rank according to this dictionary.

The use of the sorted list of unique values and the dictionary comprehension ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs. This complies with the constraints and should work efficiently on the given range of input sizes and values.

# 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance

### Problem Description 
Given the array `restaurants` where  `restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]`. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The `veganFriendly` filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with `veganFriendlyi` set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity `veganFriendlyi` and `veganFriendly` take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.


Example 1:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [3,1,5] 
Explanation: 
The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest). 

Example 2:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [4,3,2,1,5]
Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.


Example 3:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3
Output: [4,5]

Constraints:
`1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4`
`restaurants[i].length == 5`
`1 <= idi, ratingi, pricei, distancei <= 10^5`
`1 <= maxPrice, maxDistance <= 10^5`
`veganFriendlyi` and `veganFriendly` are 0 or 1.

All `idi` are distinct.

### Solution 
 Here is the Python solution according to the problem statement in a format suitable for direct use on LeetCode:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def filterRestaurants(self, restaurants: List[List[int]], veganFriendly: int, maxPrice: int, maxDistance: int) -> List[int]:
        # Filter restaurants based on the various criteria
        filtered_restaurants = [
            restaurant for restaurant in restaurants
            if (restaurant[2] >= veganFriendly and restaurant[3] <= maxPrice and restaurant[4] <= maxDistance)
        ]
        
        # Sort the filtered restaurants first by rating (descending), then by id (descending)
        filtered_restaurants.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], -x[0]))
        
        # Generate the list of IDs from the sorted restaurant data
        result = [restaurant[0] for restaurant in filtered_restaurants]
        return result

# Example usage (the below usage is to show how it would be utilized outside of LeetCode's system)
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.filterRestaurants([[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], 1, 50, 10))
# print(sol.filterRestaurants([[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], 0, 50, 10))
# print(sol.filterRestaurants([[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], 0, 30, 3))

```

### Explanation:
1. **Filter Phase:** 
    - The solution starts by filtering the input list of restaurants using a list comprehension based on the provided conditions: `veganFriendly`, `maxPrice`, and `maxDistance`.
    - If `veganFriendly` is set to 1, only those restaurants are retained where `veganFriendlyi` (the third element of the sub-list) is also 1. If `veganFriendly` is 0, this filter is ignored.
    - The `pricei` and `distancei` criteria are applied according to the values of `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` respectively.

2. **Sorting Phase:** 
    - The filtered list is then sorted. The major sorting criterion is the `ratingi` in descending order. If two restaurants have the same rating, they are further sorted by `idi` in descending order.
    - Lambda function is used for defining the complex sort order in the `sort()` method.

3. **Extraction Phase:**
    - After sorting, the IDs of the restaurants are extracted to a list and returned as the result. 

This solution ensures that the output list is both filtered and sorted according to the given constraints and preferences.

# 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

### Problem Description 
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the `1`'s will appear to the left of all the `0`'s in each row.

A row `i` is weaker than a row `j` if one of the following is true:
The number of soldiers in row `i` is less than the number of soldiers in row `j`.

Both rows have the same number of soldiers and `i < j`.

Return the indices of the `k` weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.


Example 1:
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 2 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].


Example 2:
Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 1 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 1 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [0,2,3,1].


Constraints:
`m == mat.length`
`n == mat[i].length`
`2 <= n, m <= 100`
`1 <= k <= m`
`matrix[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, you can use a strategy involving binary search combined with sorting. The idea is to first calculate the strength of each row, where strength is defined as the number of soldiers (`1`s) in that row. Given the matrix properties where 1's are always to the left of 0's, we can use binary search to efficiently count the number of 1's in each row.

Once the number of soldiers in each row is known, you can create a list of tuples where each tuple consists of the number of soldiers and the row index. Sorting this list first by the number of soldiers and then by the row index (in the case where two rows have the same number of soldiers) gives the desired order. From this sorted list, extracting the first `k` entries provides the indices of the `k` weakest rows.

Here is how you can implement this solution:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def kWeakestRows(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        def countSoldiers(row: List[int]) -> int:
            low, high = 0, len(row)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if row[mid] == 1:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            return low
        
        strengths = [(countSoldiers(row), idx) for idx, row in enumerate(mat)]
        strengths.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        return [strengths[i][1] for i in range(k)]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
mat = [[1,1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1]]
k = 3
print(sol.kWeakestRows(mat, k))  # Output: [2, 0, 3]

mat = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
k = 2
print(sol.kWeakestRows(mat, k))  # Output: [0, 2]

```

This code defines the `kWeakestRows` method in a `Solution` class. The inner function `countSoldiers` uses binary search to count the 1's in a single row. The main part then builds a list of strength values paired with their respective indices, sorts the list, and finally extracts the indices of the weakest rows up to `k`.

This solution is both time-efficient and compliant with the constraints of the problem. It makes use of Python's list comprehensions and sorting mechanics to achieve a neat and effective result.

# 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half

### Problem Description 
Given an array `arr`.  You can choose a set of integers and remove all the occurrences of these integers in the array.

Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the array are removed.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).

Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.

Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has size greater than half of the size of the old array.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,9]
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: arr = [1000,1000,3,7]
Output: 1

Example 5:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
`arr.length` is even.

`1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, the approach revolves around removing the most frequent elements first to quickly reduce the size of the array by at least half. By focusing on removing occurrences from the most frequent to the least frequent, we minimize the size of the set needed to achieve this reduction. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Count Frequency:** First, we need to compute the frequency of each element in the array. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary or Python's `collections.Counter`.

2. **Sort by Frequency:** After accumulating the frequencies, we should sort the elements based on their frequency in descending order. This way, we can start by removing the most frequent elements to achieve the desired reduction in the array size as quickly as possible.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Set Size:** We can then iterate through these sorted frequencies, cumulatively adding up these frequencies until the sum reaches at least half of the original array's length. The number of elements (or distinct integers) we've summed over will be our solution.

The algorithm can be implemented in `O(n log n)` time complexity primarily due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the array. The space complexity is `O(n)` to store the frequency of each element.

Here's a Python code to implement this solution:



```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate the frequency of each element
        freq = Counter(arr)
        
        # Get the size of the array
        n = len(arr)
        
        # Sort element frequencies in descending order
        sorted_frequencies = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
        
        # Calculate the minimum set size
        # The goal is to remove at least half of the elements
        threshold = n // 2
        current_sum = 0
        min_size = 0
        
        # Iterate over the sorted frequencies
        for count in sorted_frequencies:
            current_sum += count
            min_size += 1
            if current_sum >= threshold:
                return min_size
        
        return min_size

# Examples can be tested directly in a LeetCode environment

```

This code should be directly usable and testable on platforms like LeetCode without any modification. You can use the example cases provided in the problem description to verify its correctness.

# 1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`.

Return the number of sub-arrays of size `k` and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 1, threshold = 0
Output: 5

Example 3:
Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.


Example 4:
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 7, threshold = 7
Output: 1

Example 5:
Input: arr = [4,4,4,4], k = 4, threshold = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`
`1 <= k <= arr.length`
`0 <= threshold <= 10^4`

### Solution 
 The problem is to find the number of contiguous sub-arrays in the given `arr` such that the size of each sub-array is `k` and the average of the elements in the sub-array is greater than or equal to a given `threshold`.

We can approach this problem efficiently using a sliding window technique. This technique helps in optimizing the calculation of the sum of each sub-array of size `k`.

Here's how we can solve the problem:
1. Compute the sum of the first `k` elements.
2. Convert the condition on averages to a condition on sums. Since the average of a sub-array of size `k` needs to be at least `threshold`, the sum of this sub-array should be at least `k * threshold`.
3. Iterate over the array using the sliding window approach:
   - Slide the window one position to the right: subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the element that's entering.
   - Check if the current window's sum meets or exceeds `k * threshold`.
4. Count all such windows where the condition is satisfied.

The Python code implementing the above algorithm is shown below:



```python
class Solution:
    def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int], k: int, threshold: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        if n < k:
            return 0

        # Calculate initial sum for the first `k` elements
        current_sum = sum(arr[:k])
        required_sum = k * threshold
        count = 0
        
        # Check the initial window
        if current_sum >= required_sum:
            count += 1
        
        # Use sliding window technique
        for i in range(k, n):
            # Update the sum to reflect the sliding window
            current_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
            
            # Check if the current window satisfies the condition
            if current_sum >= required_sum:
                count += 1
        
        return count


```

This solution:
- Initializes the `current_sum` with the sum of the first `k` elements.
- Slides the window across the array from the `k-th` element, updating the sum for each new window in constant time.
- Checks each window's sum against the `required_sum` which is `k*threshold`.
- Uses a counter to track the number of valid windows and returns it at the end.

This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array, and a space complexity of \(O(1)\) (excluding the input array space).

# 1346. Check If N and Its Double Exist

### Problem Description 
Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exists two integers `N` and `M` such that `N` is the double of `M` ( i.e. `N = 2 * M`).

More formally check if there exists two indices `i` and `j` such that :
`i != j`
`0 <= i, j < arr.length`
`arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`

Example 1:
Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
Output: true
Explanation: N` = 10` is the double of M` = 5`,that is, `10 = 2 * 5`.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [7,1,14,11]
Output: true
Explanation: N` = 14` is the double of M` = 7`,that is, `14 = 2 * 7`.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: In this case does not exist N and M, such that N = 2 * M.


Constraints:
`2 <= arr.length <= 500`
`-10^3 <= arr[i] <= 10^3`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding two integers `N` and `M` in the given array `arr` such that `N` is exactly double the value of `M` (`N = 2 * M`), we can use a hash set for efficiently checking the existence of required elements.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Iterate through the array.
2. For each element `x` in the array:
   - Check if the hash set contains `2 * x` (which would mean that there is another number in the array that is double the value of `x`).
   - Also, check if the hash set contains `x / 2` and if `x` is even (which means there could be another number in the array that is half the value of `x`).
3. If either condition is met during the iterations, return `True`.
4. If no such pair is found after examining all elements, return `False`.
5. Use a hash set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far during the iteration, allowing us to check in constant time whether the required pair value exists.

This approach allows us to solve the problem in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, and in O(n) space complexity for storing the elements in the set.

Here's how you can code this solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        
        for num in arr:
            # Check if double or half of the current element exists
            if 2 * num in seen or (num % 2 == 0 and num // 2 in seen):
                return True
            # Add current number to the set
            seen.add(num)
        
        return False

```

You can test this function with the examples you provided by importing the `List` type from the typing module, a standard Python library:



```python
from typing import List

# Example 1
arr1 = [10, 2, 5, 3]
# Example 2
arr2 = [7, 1, 14, 11]
# Example 3
arr3 = [3, 1, 7, 11]

solution = Solution()
print(solution.checkIfExist(arr1))  # Output: True
print(solution.checkIfExist(arr2))  # Output: True
print(solution.checkIfExist(arr3))  # Output: False

```

This code would check for the described conditions in the provided example arrays and print the expected outputs.

# 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

### Problem Description 
Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in `grid`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
Output: 3

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 100`
`-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
Follow up: Could you find an `O(n + m)` solution?

### Solution 
 To solve this problem efficiently considering the constraints mentioned, we can maximize the use of the properties that rows and columns are sorted in non-increasing order. In such a matrix, once a negative number is found in a row at a certain column, all following columns in that row must also be negative. This insight can lead to an optimized solution:

1. Use a pointer representing the column index starting from the rightmost column (last) and for each row check from that index backwards for finding the count of negatives in that row.
2. If a negative number is found in any position, all numbers to its right (including itself) are also negative due to the sorting order.
3. We don't need to check columns to the right of the found negative number again in the next row because subsequent rows will also have negatives starting from this column or from even an earlier column.

By using a reverse linear scan starting from the upper right corner of the matrix and moving leftward and downward, we can achieve the counting in \(O(m + n)\) time, where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columnsâ€”this is because each row and column is visited at most once.

Here's how the optimized Python code following the LeetCode format can be implemented:



```python
class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        row, col = 0, n - 1
        count_negatives = 0
        
        while row < m and col >= 0:
            if grid[row][col] < 0:
                # All elements from this column in this row are negative
                count_negatives += (m - row)
                col -= 1  # Move leftwards in the same row
            else:
                # Move to the next row since current element is non-negative
                row += 1
                
        return count_negatives

# Examples to test the implementation
sol = Solution()
print(sol.countNegatives([[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]))  # Output: 8
print(sol.countNegatives([[3,2],[1,0]]))                                        # Output: 0
print(sol.countNegatives([[1,-1],[-1,-1]]))                                     # Output: 3
print(sol.countNegatives([[-1]]))                                               # Output: 1

```

This code correctly identifies the number of negatives in each matrix example efficiently. Each step is commented to make functionality clear, adhering to good coding practices and LeetCode solution formats.

# 1352. Product of the Last K Numbers

### Problem Description 
Implement the class `ProductOfNumbers` that supports two methods:
1.` add(int num)`
Adds the number `num` to the back of the current list of numbers.

2.` getProduct(int k)`
Returns the product of the last `k` numbers in the current list.

You can assume that always the current list has at least `k` numbers.

At any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.


Example:
Input
["ProductOfNumbers","add","add","add","add","add","getProduct","getProduct","getProduct","add","getProduct"]
[[],[3],[0],[2],[5],[4],[2],[3],[4],[8],[2]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,null,null,20,40,0,null,32]
Explanation
ProductOfNumbers productOfNumbers = new ProductOfNumbers();
productOfNumbers.add(3);        // [3]
productOfNumbers.add(0);        // [3,0]
productOfNumbers.add(2);        // [3,0,2]
productOfNumbers.add(5);        // [3,0,2,5]
productOfNumbers.add(4);        // [3,0,2,5,4]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 20. The product of the last 2 numbers is 5 * 4 = 20
productOfNumbers.getProduct(3); // return 40. The product of the last 3 numbers is 2 * 5 * 4 = 40
productOfNumbers.getProduct(4); // return 0. The product of the last 4 numbers is 0 * 2 * 5 * 4 = 0
productOfNumbers.add(8);        // [3,0,2,5,4,8]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 32. The product of the last 2 numbers is 4 * 8 = 32 

Constraints:
There will be at most `40000` operations considering both `add` and `getProduct`.

`0 <= num <= 100`
`1 <= k <= 40000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem using Python, we can create a class `ProductOfNumbers` that efficiently handles the operations `add` and `getProduct`. One effective way to manage computation and retrieval of the product of the last `k` numbers is to use a dynamic approach that calculates products on-the-fly and stores the results. 

A special scenario we need to handle is the presence of zero, which makes the product of any sequence containing it equal to zero. Thus, special attention should be given to how we manage zeros.

Hereâ€™s how we can implement this:
- We will maintain a list `self.products` where each element represents the product of all numbers up to that index.
- Whenever `0` is added, reset this list because any product involving that zero will be zero. However, we need to remember where the zero was added, for which we can use a variable `self.last_zero_index`.
- For the `getProduct` method, check if the last k elements contain a zero using `self.last_zero_index`. If yes, return zero. Otherwise, calculate the product by dividing the last product by the product from `len(self.products) - k - 1`.

Here's the code implementation following the described approach:



```python
class ProductOfNumbers:

    def __init__(self):
        self.products = [1]  # Start with a dummy product of 1
        self.last_zero_index = -1  # To keep track of the most recent zero index
        
    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num == 0:
            # Reset on adding zero
            self.products = [1]
            self.last_zero_index = len(self.products) - 1  # Set last zero at the current end
        else:
            if len(self.products) == 0:
                self.products.append(num)
            else:
                # Multiply the last product by num and add to products
                self.products.append(self.products[-1] * num)
    
    def getProduct(self, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(self.products)
        if n - k - 1 <= self.last_zero_index:
            # Zero is in the range of last k elements
            return 0
        else:
            # Divide the total product by the product of the prefix before the last k elements
            return self.products[-1] // self.products[-(k+1)]

# Example usage:
# productOfNumbers = ProductOfNumbers()
# productOfNumbers.add(3)
# productOfNumbers.add(0)
# productOfNumbers.add(2)
# productOfNumbers.add(5)
# productOfNumbers.add(4)
# print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(2))  # Output 20
# print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(3))  # Output 40
# print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(4))  # Output 0
# productOfNumbers.add(8)
# print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(2))  # Output 32

```

The `ProductOfNumbers` class as defined above should be efficient both in terms of time and space given the constraints, and works optimally within the provided bounds. The use of a list to store cumulative products along with careful tracking of zeros ensures we can quickly compute the product of the last `k` numbers considering special cases like the inclusion of zeros.

# 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

### Problem Description 
Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid `j's` such that `j != i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.

For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).


Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

Constraints:
`2 <= nums.length <= 500`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining how many numbers are smaller than each number in the array, we can use a simple brute-force approach as well as a more optimized approach using sorting. Since given constraints impose limitations on the array size (`2 <= nums.length <= 500`) and the range of array elements (`0 <= nums[i] <= 100`), let's consider a couple of solutions including one that leverages sorting for efficiency.

### Solution 1: Brute-force Approach
We can iterate over each element and for each element, we check against all other elements to count how many numbers are smaller. This solution would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which might be acceptable given the constraints but isn't optimal.

### Solution 2: Sorting-based Optimization
Given that the range of elements is limited to 0-100, applying a sorting-based or indexing strategy can be effective. We will:

1. Create a copy of the array and sort it. 
2. Using a dictionary, map each number to its index in the sorted list. This will tell us the count of numbers less than that number because a sorted array's index indicates how many elements are less than it.
3. Build the result by refilling for each position in the input array using this map.

Since sorting has a complexity of O(n log n) and the mapping operations are linear, this approach has a complexity of O(n log n), which is better than the brute-force method for larger input sizes, and is efficient given the constraints.

Here's the implementation for the more efficient approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Create a sorted version of nums
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
        
        # Create a dictionary that will store the count of numbers less than each number
        num_count = {}
        
        # Populate the dictionary such that each number maps to the count of smaller numbers before it
        for i, num in enumerate(sorted_nums):
            if num not in num_count:  # Only store the first occurrence (smallest index)
                num_count[num] = i
        
        # Create the result array using the dictionary
        result = [num_count[num] for num in nums]
        return result

# This solution will be directly usable to solve the problem on LeetCode's platform.

```

This code sorts the input list and then uses a dictionary to map each number to its position in the sorted order (i.e., the count of smaller numbers). It then constructs the answer by replacing each number in the original list with its count from the dictionary. This method efficiently utilizes sorting and mapping to drastically reduce the problem from a quadratic complexity to almost linearithmic complexity in relation to the input size.


# 1366. Rank Teams by Votes

### Problem Description 
In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Given an array of strings `votes` which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.

Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.


Example 1:
Input: votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
Output: "ACB"
Explanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.

Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.

Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.

As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.


Example 2:
Input: votes = ["WXYZ","XYZW"]
Output: "XWYZ"
Explanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position. 

Example 3:
Input: votes = ["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]
Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
Explanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.


Example 4:
Input: votes = ["BCA","CAB","CBA","ABC","ACB","BAC"]
Output: "ABC"
Explanation: 
Team A was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.

Team B was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.

Team C was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.

There is a tie and we rank teams ascending by their IDs.


Example 5:
Input: votes = ["M","M","M","M"]
Output: "M"
Explanation: Only team M in the competition so it has the first rank.


Constraints:
`1 <= votes.length <= 1000`
`1 <= votes[i].length <= 26`
`votes[i].length == votes[j].length` for `0 <= i, j < votes.length`.

`votes[i][j]` is an English upper-case letter.

All characters of `votes[i]` are unique.

All the characters that occur in `votes[0]` also occur in `votes[j]` where `1 <= j < votes.length`.

### Solution 
 Here's a Python solution to the described problem, using the guidelines and constraints provided:



```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes):
        if not votes:
            return ""
        
        # Initialize a dictionary to store the rank counts for each team
        rank_dict = defaultdict(lambda: [0] * len(votes[0]))
        
        # Fill the rank_dict with ranks for each team
        for vote in votes:
            for rank, team in enumerate(vote):
                rank_dict[team][rank] += 1
        
        # Sort the teams based on the ranking criteria:
        # 1. Ranks in descending order of votes
        # 2. Alphabetical order as a tie-breaker
        sorted_teams = sorted(rank_dict.keys(), key=lambda team: (rank_dict[team], -ord(team)), reverse=True)
        
        # Join sorted team names into a single string
        return ''.join(sorted_teams)

# Examples to run the solution:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.rankTeams(["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]))  # Output: "ACB"
print(sol.rankTeams(["WXYZ","XYZW"]))  # Output: "XWYZ"
print(sol.rankTeams(["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]))  # Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
print(sol.rankTeams(["BCA","CAB","CBA","ABC","ACB","BAC"]))  # Output: "ABC"
print(sol.rankTeams(["M","M","M","M"]))  # Output: "M"

```

### Explanation
1. **Dictionary Initialization:**
The solution uses a dictionary `rank_dict` where each key is a team's letter and the value is a list of rank counts. Each index in the list corresponds to a ranking position (e.g., index 0 for 1st place votes, index 1 for 2nd place votes, etc.).

2. **Rank Counting:**
The rank dictionary is filled out by iterating over each vote and increasing the corresponding rank count for each team.

3. **Sorting the Teams:**
Teams are sorted primarily based on the rank counts, which are in descending order (because a higher count of 1st place votes is better). Teams are also sorted by their ASCII values in case of ties (using a negative ASCII value allows for regular alphabet sorting while handling list ordering priorities in Python).

This solution adheres to the constraints and ensures the teams are ranked according to the specified criteria, outputting the result as a concatenated string of team letters.


# 1375. Bulb Switcher III

### Problem Description 
There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `1` to `n`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.

At moment k (for k from `0` to `n - 1`), we turn on the `light[k]` bulb. A bulb change color to blue only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.

Return the number of moments in which all turned on bulbs are blue.


Example 1:
Input: light = [2,1,3,5,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.


Example 2:
Input: light = [3,2,4,1,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).


Example 3:
Input: light = [4,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).

Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.


Example 4:
Input: light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
Output: 3

Example 5:
Input: light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6

Constraints:
`n == light.length`
`1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
`light` is a permutation of  `[1, 2, ..., n]`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining how many bulbs are blue at each moment when they are turned on, we need to track the moments when all previously turned-on bulbs (inclusive) are switched on. A bulb turns blue if and only if it is turned on and all bulbs to its left are also on (i.e., all bulbs from 1 up to the current bulb must be on).

### Approach:
1. Keep track of the maximum bulb number treated (`maxOn`) that has been turned on so far. At any point, if the maximum bulb number that should be on is equal to the current bulb, then those bulbs will be blue.
2. Initialize `maxOn` to zero.
3. Iterate through the light array. For each index, update `maxOn` to be the maximum of `maxOn` or the current bulb's sequence number (light value at current index). If at any point `maxOn` is equal to the index + 1 (because `light` is originally 1-indexed), then all previous bulbs and the current one are on and blue.
4. Increase the count whenever this condition is met.

This solution runs in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity since we are simply iterating through the array and doing constant-time checks and updates.

Below is the Python code that adheres to the LeetCode solution format and can be directly tested there:



```python
class Solution:
    def numTimesAllBlue(self, light: List[int]) -> int:
        maxOn = 0
        blueMoments = 0
        
        for i in range(len(light)):
            maxOn = max(maxOn, light[i])
            if maxOn == i + 1:
                blueMoments += 1
        
        return blueMoments

# Example test cases
sol = Solution()
print(sol.numTimesAllBlue([2,1,3,5,4]))  # Output: 3
print(sol.numTimesAllBlue([3,2,4,1,5]))  # Output: 2
print(sol.numTimesAllBlue([4,1,2,3]))    # Output: 1
print(sol.numTimesAllBlue([2,1,4,3,6,5]))  # Output: 3
print(sol.numTimesAllBlue([1,2,3,4,5,6]))  # Output: 6

```

This solution maintains count and updates it accordingly as it iterates through the input list, effectively and efficiently meeting the requirements of the problem statement.

# 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix

### Problem Description 
Given a `m * n` matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.


Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]

Constraints:
`m == mat.length`
`n == mat[i].length`
`1 <= n, m <= 50`
`1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5`.

All elements in the matrix are distinct.

### Solution 
 Here's a Python code solution that can be run directly on LeetCode, adhering to the guidelines and format typical of a LeetCode problem solution submission, including classes and methods as they expect:



```python
class Solution:
    def luckyNumbers (self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        lucky_nums = []
        
        for i in range(m):
            min_val = matrix[i][0]
            min_col_idx = 0
            
            # Find the minimum in the current row
            for j in range(1, n):
                if matrix[i][j] < min_val:
                    min_val = matrix[i][j]
                    min_col_idx = j
                    
            # Check if it's the maximum in its column
            is_lucky = True
            for k in range(m):
                if matrix[k][min_col_idx] > min_val:
                    is_lucky = False
                    break

            if is_lucky:
                lucky_nums.append(min_val)

        return lucky_nums

# Example of usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.luckyNumbers([[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]))  # Output: [15]
# print(sol.luckyNumbers([[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]))  # Output: [12]
# print(sol.luckyNumbers([[7,8],[1,2]]))  # Output: [7]

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: We start by defining the class `Solution` with the method `luckyNumbers` which takes as input a 2D list `matrix` representing the matrix.

2. **Iterate through each row**: For each row in the matrix, we:
   - Initialize `min_val` to the first element of the row and `min_col_idx` to 0.
   - Find the minimum value in the row and store its column index in `min_col_idx`.

3. **Determine if the minimum is the maximum in its column**:
   - For the identified column, check each row to ensure that the chosen minimum value is the maximum in its column. If any value in the column is greater than `min_val`, it disqualifies the element from being a "lucky number".
   
4. **If lucky, add to results**: If the element is confirmed to be "lucky", add it to the result list `lucky_nums`.

5. **Return the list of lucky numbers**.

The solution is efficient given the constraints (`m` and `n` up to 50), meaning a direct approach with time complexity approximately O(m * n) suffices due to the double loop over the rows and checking columns for max condition.

# 1386. Cinema Seat Allocation

### Problem Description 
A cinema has `n` rows of seats, numbered from 1 to `n` and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.

Given the array `reservedSeats` containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, `reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]` means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is already reserved.

Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^9`
`1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)`
`reservedSeats[i].length == 2`
`1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n`
`1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10`
All `reservedSeats[i]` are distinct.

### Solution 
 The task is to find the maximum number of 4-person groups that can be seated together in a cinema with a peculiar seating arrangement that includes aisles breaking seat continuity. Since rows can be computed independently of each other, the solution should address each row separately. Given the constraints, especially the number of rows, implementing a solution that doesn't account for unreserved rows is crucial.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Understand the Grouping Rules for Seating**: Parties of four can be seated in these configurations:
    - Left group (L): Seats 1-4 in each row
    - Middle group (M): Seats 3-6 in each row
    - Middle Right group (R): Seats 5-8 in each row
    - Right Edge group (F): Seats 7-10 in each row

2. **Handle Aisles**: The problem mentions an aisle which splits groups if positioned between seats 4 and 5 an exception has been made to accommodate up to 2 groups.

3. **Data Structures and Parsing**:
    - Use a dictionary to map each row to its reserved seats. This helps because the maximum usable data is bound by `reservedSeats.length`.
    - Traverse each row using this mapping, and check available spots for the groups defined.

4. **Computation**:
    - Compute for each row independently since the reservation status of a row does not affect other rows.
    - For each row, determine if the left, middle, middle right, and right edge groups are entirely unreserved.
    
5. **Optimized Checking**:
    - For rows without any reserved seats, add optimal number of groups (2 groups).
    - For rows with reservations, manually check each group option unless the seats are reserved.

Here's the implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfFamilies(self, n: int, reservedSeats: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Map to hold the reserved seats in each row
        reserved_map = defaultdict(set)
        for seat in reservedSeats:
            row, col = seat
            reserved_map[row].add(col)
        
        # Maximum families that can be seated
        max_families = 0
        
        # Process potential full rows
        max_families += 2 * (n - len(reserved_map)) # Two families can sit in entirely free rows
        
        # Process rows with reservations
        for row, cols in reserved_map.items():
            possible = 0
            
            # Check first segment: Positions 1-4
            if all(c not in cols for c in range(1, 5)):
                possible += 1
            
            # Check third segment: Positions 7-10
            if all(c not in cols for c in range(7, 11)):
                possible += 1
            
            # Check second segment (middle left): Positions 3-6
            # Check fourth segment (middle right): Positions 5-8
            if possible == 0:  # Only consider middle parts if neither left nor right segment is possible
                middle_left_possible = all(c not in cols for c in range(3, 7))
                middle_right_possible = all(c not in cols for c in range(5, 9))
                if middle_left_possible or middle_right_possible:
                    possible = 1
            
            max_families += possible
        
        return max_families

```

This solution uses a hash map (implemented via `defaultdict`) to associate each row with its reserved seats, then iterates over the input list to populate this map. Each row is processed individually, checking for possible seating clusters and adjusting the count accordingly. The approach ensures that memory and compute demands are minimized, crucial for handling the upper limits of problem constraints efficiently. This should comfortably work within the provided constraints of the problem.

# 1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order

### Problem Description 
Given two arrays of integers `nums` and `index`. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:
Initially target array is empty.

From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index `index[i]` the value `nums[i]` in target array.

Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in `nums` and `index.`
Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
nums       index     target
0            0        [0]
1            1        [0,1]
2            2        [0,1,2]
3            2        [0,1,3,2]
4            1        [0,4,1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,0], index = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
nums       index     target
1            0        [1]
2            1        [1,2]
3            2        [1,2,3]
4            3        [1,2,3,4]
0            0        [0,1,2,3,4]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], index = [0]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length, index.length <= 100`
`nums.length == index.length`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
`0 <= index[i] <= i`

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution for the described problem using the LeetCode format. The solution involves using a list for the target array and inserting elements into it based on the corresponding indices provided. 

The runtime complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the `list.insert()` operation which can be O(n) in the worst case, carried out n times (n is the length of the `nums` or `index`). Despite this, it is acceptable given the constraint that n can be at most 100.

Hereâ€™s the complete code:



```python
class Solution:
    def createTargetArray(self, nums: List[int], index: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        target = []  # Initialize the target array as an empty list
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            target.insert(index[i], nums[i])  # Insert element from nums at the position specified by index
        return target
        
# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.createTargetArray([0,1,2,3,4], [0,1,2,2,1]))  # Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
    print(sol.createTargetArray([1,2,3,4,0], [0,1,2,3,0]))  # Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
    print(sol.createTargetArray([1], [0]))  # Output: [1]

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an empty list named `target`.
2. **Iterating through Inputs**: We loop through each element of `nums` and `index` using a loop that iterates through the range equal to their length.
3. **Insert Operation**: Inside the loop, we use the `insert()` method of the list, which allows us to place an element at a specific index, pushing back other elements as needed. This is where we take `nums[i]` and insert it at the position `index[i]` in the `target` list.
4. **Return Result**: After the loop completes, we return the modified `target` list which now contains all elements from `nums` arranged based on `index`.

This method ensures that we build the target list in accordance to the exact sequence of operations described by the `index` array. Each insertion operation adjusts the positions of existing elements as needed, which is precisely what is required according to the problem statement.

# 1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr`, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return a lucky integer in the array. If there are multiple lucky integers return the largest of them. If there is no lucky integer return -1.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.


Example 4:
Input: arr = [5]
Output: -1

Example 5:
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 7

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 500`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 500`

### Solution 
 Below is the Python solution for the problem statement described above. The code uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the array and then checks if any number's frequency matches its own value. The solution ensures the result is the largest lucky number or returns -1 if no lucky number is found.



```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Count the frequency of each element in the array
        frequency = Counter(arr)
        
        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the largest lucky number found, starting with -1.
        lucky_number = -1
        
        # Verify each element in the frequency dictionary
        for number, freq in frequency.items():
            # Check if the number is a lucky number
            if number == freq:
                # Update the lucky_number if the current number is larger than the previously found lucky number
                if number > lucky_number:
                    lucky_number = number
                    
        # Return the largest lucky number or -1 if none were found
        return lucky_number

# Examples for testing
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findLucky([2,2,3,4]))   # Output: 2
print(sol.findLucky([1,2,2,3,3,3]))  # Output: 3
print(sol.findLucky([2,2,2,3,3])) # Output: -1
print(sol.findLucky([5])) # Output: -1
print(sol.findLucky([7,7,7,7,7,7,7])) # Output: 7

```

### Explanation:

1. **Counter Usage:** We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the input list.
   
2. **Initialization:** We initialize `lucky_number` to -1 to handle cases where no lucky number is found.

3. **Traverse and Check:** Traverse through the frequency dictionary which contains numbers as keys and their frequencies as values. Check if a number's frequency (value) matches the number itself.

4. **Update Largest Lucky Number:** Whenever we find such a number, we compare it with `lucky_number` and update `lucky_number` if this new lucky number is larger.

5. **Return Output:** After completing the traversal, `lucky_number` will either contain the largest lucky number found, or remain -1 if no lucky number was found, and we return this value.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n) in the worst case due to the population and checking through the dictionary, where n is the number of elements in the array `arr`. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the dictionary used to store the frequencies. Given the constraints, this solution performs efficiently.

# 1395. Count Number of Teams

### Problem Description 
There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique `rating` value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:
Choose 3 soldiers with index (`i`, `j`, `k`) with rating (`rating[i]`, `rating[j]`, `rating[k]`).

A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`0 <= i < j < k < n`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).


Example 1:
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 

Example 2:
Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.


Example 3:
Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`n == rating.length`
`3 <= n <= 1000`
`1 <= rating[i] <= 105`
All the integers in `rating` are unique.

### Solution 
 Here's the Python solution for the given problem following the LeetCode format. The code uses a dual loop approach to count the numbers of possible teams under the given conditions. This approach checks the ascending or descending condition between any triplet (i, j, k) using two nested loops combined with conditional counting.

The outer loop iterates through the list to select the 'j' position, while the nested loops scan the list to the left for 'i' and to the right for 'k'. By using a combination of counting techniques, the solution aggregates the count of valid triplets, ensuring the conditions are met without the direct checking of all combinations, which makes the approach efficient for larger arrays.

Given the constraints, this solution is both acceptable in term of computational complexity.



```python
class Solution:
    def numTeams(self, rating: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(rating)
        count = 0
        
        # Explore every triplet (i, j, k) such that i < j < k
        for j in range(n):
            left_smaller, left_larger = 0, 0
            right_smaller, right_larger = 0, 0
            
            # Count how many elements on the left of j are smaller/larger than rating[j]
            for i in range(j):
                if rating[i] < rating[j]:
                    left_smaller += 1
                elif rating[i] > rating[j]:
                    left_larger += 1

            # Count how many elements on the right of j are smaller/larger than rating[j]
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if rating[k] < rating[j]:
                    right_smaller += 1
                elif rating[k] > rating[j]:
                    right_larger += 1
            
            # Combine the counts to get valid triplet teams
            # left_smaller and right_larger for increasing sequence
            # left_larger and right_smaller for decreasing sequence
            count += left_smaller * right_larger + left_larger * right_smaller
        
        return count

```

This solution first counts the number of soldiers with ratings less (left_smaller) and greater (left_larger) than `rating[j]` on the left, similarly does for the right of `j` (right_smaller and right_larger). Then, it combines these counts to get the number of valid triplets which makes `rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]` or `rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`. This more computational-efficient method ensures that we evaluate each relevant soldier triplet relation exactly once.

# 1399. Count Largest Group

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `n`. Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the sum of its digits. 
Return how many groups have the largest size.


Example 1:
Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. There are 4 groups with largest size.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.


Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: 6

Example 4:
Input: n = 24
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 10^4`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to group numbers based on the sum of their digits and then determine which of these group sizes is the largest and how many such groups exist.

To approach this:
1. Iterate through each number from `1` to `n`.
2. Calculate the sum of the digits for each number.
3. Use a dictionary to keep track of how many numbers have the same digit sum.
4. After counting the occurrence of all possible sums, find the maximum count (size of the largest group).
5. Count how many groups have this maximum size.

Let's walk through the steps with an example:
For `n = 13`, the calculation of sum of digits for each number from `1` to `13` gives the following groups:
  - Sum 1: [1, 10]
  - Sum 2: [2, 11]
  - Sum 3: [3, 12]
  - Sum 4: [4, 13]
  - Sum 5: [5]
  - (so on) ...

The `sumMap` will look like: `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}`. The largest group size is `2`, and there are exactly `4` groups having this size (`1, 2, 3, 4`).

Let's implement this solution in Python.



```python
class Solution:
    def countLargestGroup(self, n: int) -> int:
        def sum_of_digits(x):
            return sum(int(c) for c in str(x))
        
        # Dictionary to count the numbers in each group by their digit sum
        sum_map = {}
        
        # Count the numbers in each group
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            digit_sum = sum_of_digits(i)
            if digit_sum not in sum_map:
                sum_map[digit_sum] = 0
            sum_map[digit_sum] += 1
        
        # Find the maximum group size
        max_size = max(sum_map.values())
        
        # Count how many groups have the maximum size
        count = sum(1 for group_size in sum_map.values() if group_size == max_size)
        
        return count

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.countLargestGroup(13))  # Output: 4
print(sol.countLargestGroup(2))   # Output: 2
print(sol.countLargestGroup(15))  # Output: 6
print(sol.countLargestGroup(24))  # Output: 5

```

This Python class-based solution follows the canonical format for LeetCode and should execute directly with their platform. The code iterates once over the range, performs digit sum calculations with a string conversion and integer parsing method, utilizes a dictionary to tally group sizes, and finally aggregates results with a comprehensive scan of the dictionary to determine the result. This should be efficient for the given constraint, `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

# 1409. Queries on a Permutation With Key

### Problem Description 
Given the array `queries` of positive integers between `1` and `m`, you have to process all `queries[i]` (from `i=0` to `i=queries.length-1`) according to the following rules:
In the beginning, you have the permutation `P=[1,2,3,...,m]`.

For the current `i`, find the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P` (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation `P.` Notice that the position of `queries[i]` in `P` is the result for `queries[i]`.

Return an array containing the result for the given `queries`.


Example 1:
Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
Output: [2,1,2,1] 
Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. 
Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].  

Example 2:
Input: queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4
Output: [3,1,2,0]

Example 3:
Input: queries = [7,5,5,8,3], m = 8
Output: [6,5,0,7,5]

Constraints:
`1 <= m <= 10^3`
`1 <= queries.length <= m`
`1 <= queries[i] <= m`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we will maintain and update a list to represent the permutation `P`. For each element in the `queries`, we will:

1. Locate the index of the queried number in the current permutation list `P`.
2. Record the index value since that's what the problem expects us to return.
3. Move the queried number from its current position to the beginning of the list.

Given the constraints (`1 <= m <= 1000` and `1 <= queries.length <= m`), directly manipulating the list with operations like `index()` to get positions and slicing or `pop()` and `insert()` to rearrange should perform adequately.

Here's the Python solution using a direct list manipulation approach, suitable for submitting to LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def processQueries(self, queries: List[int], m: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the permutation P with elements from 1 to m
        P = list(range(1, m + 1))

        # This will be our result list
        result = []

        # Process each query in the queries list
        for query in queries:
            # Find the position of the query in the current permutation
            position = P.index(query)
            # Append this position to the result
            result.append(position)
            # Move the element at this position to the start of the list
            # We can do this by popping and then inserting at the front
            P.insert(0, P.pop(position))

        # Return the final result list
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `P` is initialized as a list of integers from `1` to `m`.
   - An empty list `result` is prepared to store results.
   
2. **Processing the Queries:**
   - For each `query` value in `queries`, we use the `index` method to find its current position in `P`.
   - The position is recorded in the `result` list.
   - The queried value is moved to the beginning of `P` by removing (`pop`) it from its position and then inserting (`insert`) it at the start of the list (`0` index).
   
3. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries, the `result` list is returned.

This approach is direct, reflecting the step-by-step instructions from the problem statement and will run efficiently given the suggested constraints on `m` and `queries`.

# 1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `nums`, you start with an initial positive value startValue.

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus elements in `nums` (from left to right).

Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: If you choose startValue = 4, in the third iteration your step by step sum is less than 1.

                step by step sum
                startValue = 4 | startValue = 5 | nums
                  (4 -3 ) = 1  | (5 -3 ) = 2    |  -3
                  (1 +2 ) = 3  | (2 +2 ) = 4    |   2
                  (3 -3 ) = 0  | (4 -3 ) = 1    |  -3
                  (0 +4 ) = 4  | (1 +4 ) = 5    |   4
                  (4 +2 ) = 6  | (5 +2 ) = 7    |   2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Minimum start value should be positive. 

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,-2,-3]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 100`
`-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution to the problem described above. We'll need to ensure that the starting value (`startValue`) when added cumulatively to elements of the array `nums` never results in cumulative sums less than 1. This requires us to dynamically track the running sum and adjust `startValue` accordingly to handle the lowest running sum dips.

We'll explain each step with comments to make it clear, and ensure the solution conforms to the format required by LeetCode for direct execution.



```python
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Set the minimum required start value to 1 (as the problem states it should be positive)
        min_start_value = 1
        
        # The running sum starts at 0
        current_sum = 0
        
        # Traverse through each number in the list
        for num in nums:
            # Update the running sum by adding the current number
            current_sum += num
            
            # If the current sum is such that it would bring the step-by-step sum below 1,
            # we need to adjust the minimum start value
            # We need the start value such that startValue + current_sum >= 1
            # Rearranging gives us startValue >= 1 - current_sum
            if current_sum < 1:
                # Calculate the required addition so sum never drops below 1
                required_start_value = 1 - current_sum
                
                # Update the minimum necessary start value if this required value is greater
                min_start_value = max(min_start_value, required_start_value)
        
        # Return the computed minimum start value which satisfies problem conditions
        return min_start_value

# Please note, you need to add this statement: `from typing import List` at the very top of the code
# if you're testing this in a local Python environment because the `List` type is used in the function signature.

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We start with a minimum starting value (`min_start_value`) of 1, and an initial current sum (`current_sum`) of 0.
2. **Iteration over nums**: For each element in the `nums` array:
    - **Update Running Sum**: We increase `current_sum` by the current element.
    - **Check and Adjust `min_start_value`**: If `current_sum` is less than 1, it implies that with the current `min_start_value`, the cumulative sum might drop below 1 at this point if started at this minimum. We then calculate the required starting value to ensure the sum at this point is at least 1. If this required starting value is higher than our current `min_start_value`, we update it.
3. **Return Result**: The loop guarantees that `min_start_value` is the smallest value with which the sum never drops below 1 through every iteration of the array.

This algorithm performs efficiently in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array `nums`, and uses O(1) additional space.

# 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K

### Problem Description 
Given an integer `k`, return the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to `k`. The same Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:
`F1 = 1`
`F2 = 1`
`Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2` for `n > 2.`
It is guaranteed that for the given constraints we can always find such Fibonacci numbers that sum up to `k`.


Example 1:
Input: k = 7
Output: 2 
Explanation: The Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... 
For k = 7 we can use 2 + 5 = 7.


Example 2:
Input: k = 10
Output: 2 
Explanation: For k = 10 we can use 2 + 8 = 10.


Example 3:
Input: k = 19
Output: 3 
Explanation: For k = 19 we can use 1 + 5 + 13 = 19.


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= 10^9`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem on LeetCode, we will generate Fibonacci numbers up to `k` and then use a greedy approach by taking the largest Fibonacci numbers possible until the sum equals `k`.

The Python solution will consist of two main steps:

1. **Generate Fibonacci numbers up to `k`**: We compute the Fibonacci sequence until the largest Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `k`. This will require iterative calculation given the exponential growth of the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **Use a greedy strategy to find the minimum count of Fibonacci numbers that sum up to `k`**: Starting from the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `k`, we will subtract it from `k` and then move to the next largest Fibonacci number, continuing this process until `k` equals zero. We'll count the number of subtractions, which gives the number of Fibonacci numbers used in the sum.

Here is the Python code implementing the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def findMinFibonacciNumbers(self, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to 'k'
        fibs = [1, 1]
        while fibs[-1] <= k:
            fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
        
        # Step 2: Use a greedy approach to find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers
        count = 0
        i = len(fibs) - 1
        while k > 0:
            # Use the largest possible Fibonacci number
            if fibs[i] <= k:
                k -= fibs[i]
                count += 1
            i -= 1
            
        return count

# The test cases
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findMinFibonacciNumbers(7))  # Output: 2
print(sol.findMinFibonacciNumbers(10))  # Output: 2
print(sol.findMinFibonacciNumbers(19))  # Output: 3

```

### Explanation:
- **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The list `fibs` stores Fibonacci numbers, created by iterative additions until the numbers exceed `k`.
- **Greedy Approach**: We initialize `count` to 0 and use a reverse iteration starting from the largest Fibonacci number. If this number can be subtracted from `k` (i.e., it's less than or equal to `k`), we do so and increment the `count`. This process is repeated by decreasing `i` until `k` becomes zero.
- This greedy approach works since taking the largest possible Fibonacci number reduces `k` significantly faster, thus using fewer numbers in the sum, maximizing the reduction in each step.

This solution is optimized for the problem's constraints and is efficient in handling large values of `k`.

# 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards

### Problem Description 
There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the maximum score you can obtain.


Example 1:
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.


Example 2:
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.


Example 3:
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.


Example 4:
Input: cardPoints = [1,1000,1], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot take the card in the middle. Your best score is 1. 

Example 5:
Input: cardPoints = [1,79,80,1,1,1,200,1], k = 3
Output: 202

Constraints:
`1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
`1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we can use a sliding window technique which involves deducing the sum of a subarray of length `len(cardPoints) - k` that has the minimum sum in the array. The maximum score can then be derived by subtracting the total sum of this subarray from the total sum of the `cardPoints` array.

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the problem constraint:** You can take cards from either end of the array, which makes this a combination of prefix sums from the left or the right. To maximize the score, you'd want to minimize the sum of the ignored cards.

2. **Using a sliding window to minimize ignored cards sum:** Consider the total sum of all cards. If we need to take `k` cards, then `len(cardPoints) - k` cards will be ignored. Finding the smallest sum among any consecutive subarrays of length `len(cardPoints) - k` gives the smallest sum of ignored cards. 

3. **Calculating the answer:** The maximum score is derived by subtracting the minimum sum of ignored cards (from step `2`) from the overall sum of the cardPoints.

4. **Special edge cases:** If `k` equals the length of `cardPoints`, you simply sum up all the cards, as you aren't ignoring any.

 ### Steps in the code:
1. Calculate the total sum of the `cardPoints`.
2. If `k` is equal to the number of cards, return this sum.
3. Use a sliding window approach to find the smallest sum of any consecutive subarray of size `len(cardPoints)-k`.
4. Subtract the smallest sum found from the total to get the maximum points achievable.

Below is the Python solution that can be run directly on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(cardPoints)
        # If k is equal to the number of cards, take all cards
        if k == n:
            return sum(cardPoints)
        
        # Total sum of all elements
        total_sum = sum(cardPoints)
        
        # Length of the subarray to find the minimum sum
        subarray_length = n - k
        min_subarray_sum = float('inf')
        
        current_sum = 0
        left = 0
        
        # Find the minimum sum of any subarray of length subarray_length
        for right in range(n):
            current_sum += cardPoints[right]
            
            # When window reaches desired subarray length, move left bound
            if right - left + 1 > subarray_length:
                current_sum -= cardPoints[left]
                left += 1
            
            # Update the minimum subarray sum
            if right - left + 1 == subarray_length:
                min_subarray_sum = min(min_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        # Maximum score is the total sum minus the minimum sum of the ignored subarray
        return total_sum - min_subarray_sum

```

This code implements the described optimization using a sliding window method. It efficiently finds the minimum sum of the cards we're forced to ignore so as to maximize the sum of the cards we can take, achieving an efficient and straightforward solution.

# 1424. Diagonal Traverse II

### Problem Description 
Given a list of lists of integers, `nums`, return all elements of `nums` in diagonal order as shown in the below images.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7],[8],[9,10,11],[12,13,14,15,16]]
Output: [1,6,2,8,7,3,9,4,12,10,5,13,11,14,15,16]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[4],[5,6,7],[8],[9,10,11]]
Output: [1,4,2,5,3,8,6,9,7,10,11]

Example 4:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3,4,5,6]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums[i].length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^9`
There at most `10^5` elements in `nums`.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem of returning all elements of `nums` in diagonal order, we can use a dictionary to group elements that lie on the same diagonal. Diagonal elements share a unique characteristic: the difference between their row and column indices (r - c) remains constant across any single diagonal.

Here's the approach to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary called `diagonals` to store elements by their diagonal keys (r - c).
2. Traverse each element in `nums` with its indices, and for each element `nums[i][j]`, compute the diagonal key as `i - j`.
3. Append each element to its respective list in `diagonals` based on its diagonal key.
4. After grouping all elements by their diagonal keys, extract and concatenate them. This requires careful attention to the order of diagonals and elements within each diagonal.

For example, when traversing the input, each element `nums[i][j]` is placed into a group indexed by `i - j`. After populating this mapping, iterating over sorted diagonal keys allows us to collect the elements in the desired order.

Let's now convert this approach into Python code.



```python
class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Using a dictionary to map `diagonal index` to elements in that diagonal
        diagonals = {}
        
        # Fill the dictionary with the elements according to their diagonal indices
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums[i])):
                diag_index = i - j
                if diag_index not in diagonals:
                    diagonals[diag_index] = []
                # Prepend to preserve order (based on example requirements)
                diagonals[diag_index].append(nums[i][j])
        
        # Output list
        result = []
        
        # We process diagonals starting from the smallest index
        for k in sorted(diagonals.keys()):
            # Since we added the items in a flipped order to each list, we need to reverse them back
            result.extend(reversed(diagonals[k]))
        
        return result

```

This code should be added to the LeetCode editor under the class name `Solution`, and the `findDiagonalOrder` function can then be directly called with any test cases as per the provided problem statement. The solution utilizes a dictionary to facilitate easy grouping by diagonal indices, and careful ordering within list operations to match the required output pattern. This should be efficient enough given the constraints, focusing on clarity and correctness.

# 1426. Counting Elements

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `arr`, count how many elements `x` there are, such that `x + 1` is also in `arr`. If there are duplicates in `arr`, count them separately.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.


Example 4:
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.


Example 5:
Input: arr = [1,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Both 1s are counted because 2 is in the array.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
`0 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 Below is the Python code that solves the given problem. This solution creates a set from the array for O(1) average time complexity lookups and then counts the elements that satisfy the condition `x + 1 in arr`. The code also includes necessary comments to explain each part of the process.



```python
class Solution:
    def countElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a set from the array for constant time lookup
        value_set = set(arr)
        
        # Initialize the count
        count = 0

        # Loop through each element in the original array
        for num in arr:
            # Check if the element plus one is in the set
            if num + 1 in value_set:
                count += 1
        
        # Return the count of elements that meet the condition
        return count

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.countElements([1,2,3]))  # Output: 2
# print(sol.countElements([1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]))  # Output: 0
# print(sol.countElements([1,3,2,3,5,0]))  # Output: 3
# print(sol.countElements([1,1,2,2]))  # Output: 2
# print(sol.countElements([1,1,2]))  # Output: 2

```

### Explanation

1. **Set Creation**: Convert the list `arr` into a set called `value_set`. The set allows us to check for the presence of elements in O(1) time on average.
  
2. **Count Initialization**: Initialize a counter `count` to zero. This will keep track of the number of valid elements.
  
3. **Iterate and Count**: Loop through each element `num` in the original array `arr`. For each element, check if `(num + 1)` exists in `value_set`. If it does, increment the `count` by one.
  
4. **Return Result**: After finishing the loop, return the `count`. This is the number of elements in the array that meet the condition as stated in the problem.

**Complexity**: The solution primarily includes a loop that runs in O(n) time where n is the length of `arr`, and set operations that run in average O(1) time. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the additional storage required for the set. This solution is efficient and suitable for the problem constraints (with n up to 1000).

# 1427. Perform String Shifts

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix `shift`, where `shift[i] = [direction, amount]`:
`direction` can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift). 
`amount` is the amount by which string `s` is to be shifted.

A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.

Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation: 
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:  
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 100`
`s` only contains lower case English letters.

`1 <= shift.length <= 100`
`shift[i].length == 2`
`0 <= shift[i][0] <= 1`
`0 <= shift[i][1] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, the idea is to determine the net number of shifts required and its direction efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computations. Given the constraints, applying each shift individually can be avoided since multiple shifts can be aggregated into a single operation.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Net Shift**: Traverse the list of shift operations to calculate the net effective shift. For every operation with `direction` as `0`, decrease the net shift count and for `direction` as `1`, increase the net shift count. This gives us a total count which could be either positive (indicating net right shifts) or negative (indicating net left shifts).

2. **Reduce Overflows**: Since shifting a string of length `n` by `n` or any multiple of `n` times results in the string returning to its original arrangement, we can take modulo of the absolute net shift count with the string length, reducing unnecessary computations.

3. **Determine Effective Shift and Direction**: Depending on the sign and value of the net shift post modulo operation, decide the direction (left or right).

4. **Apply the Shift**: Shift the string based on the effective shift and direction computed previously.

5. **Return the Resulting String**: After making the effective shifts, return the modified string.

This approach ensures we work with minimized operations, keeping the computation at an effective computation time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string.

Here is the implementation using this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def stringShift(self, s: str, shift: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        # Calculate net shifts
        net_shift = 0
        for direction, amount in shift:
            if direction == 0:
                net_shift -= amount  # left shift
            else:
                net_shift += amount  # right shift
        
        # Modulo the length of the string to ensure shifts are minimal
        net_shift %= len(s)
        
        # If net shift is 0, return the string as it is
        if net_shift == 0:
            return s
        
        # Depending on the direction of net shifts we slice the string
        if net_shift > 0:  # net right shift
            net_shift = len(s) - net_shift
        else:  # net left shift
            net_shift = -net_shift
        
        # Perform the shift
        result = s[net_shift:] + s[:net_shift]
        
        return result

```

This code defines the `stringShift` method expected on the LeetCode platform inside a `Solution` class. It gathers shifts to perform this calculation only once, adjusts via modulo to avoid redundant shifts, and finally applies the determined valid shift to achieve the transformed string efficiently.

# 1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One

### Problem Description 
(This problem is an interactive problem.)
A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are `0` or `1` and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix `binaryMatrix`, return the index (0-indexed) of the leftmost column with a 1 in it. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

You can't access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:
`BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).

`BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows x cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix `mat`. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.


Example 1:
Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: -1

Example 4:
Input: mat = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`rows == mat.length`
`cols == mat[i].length`
`1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
`mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

`mat[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution 
 Below is a Python implementation to solve the given problem using the defined `BinaryMatrix` interface. This implementation follows an efficient approach, utilizing the properties of the row-sorted binary matrix by starting from the top-right corner and moving leftwards if a `1` is found, and downwards otherwise. This ensures that each column and row is visited at most once, leading to a time complexity of O(rows + cols), which is optimal given the constraints.



```python
# For use on LeetCode:
# The BinaryMatrix is provided by the problem statement in the interactive environment.

# Definition for a Binary Matrix.
# class BinaryMatrix(object):
#     def get(self, row: int, col: int) -> int:
#     def dimensions(self) -> list:

def leftMostColumnWithOne(binaryMatrix: 'BinaryMatrix') -> int:
    # Get dimensions of the matrix
    dimensions = binaryMatrix.dimensions()
    rows, cols = dimensions[0], dimensions[1]
    
    # Initialize row and col pointers
    row, col = 0, cols - 1
    # Variable to track the left-most index of column containing '1'
    left_most_col = -1
    
    # Iterate while the row and col pointers are within the bounds of the matrix
    while row < rows and col >= 0:
        # Get the current value
        current_value = binaryMatrix.get(row, col)
        
        # If we find a '1', we move left to see if there is a column with '1' further left
        if current_value == 1:
            left_most_col = col   # Update the left-most column index
            col -= 1              # Move left
        else:
            # If current value is '0', move down to the next row
            row += 1
    
    return left_most_col

# This function can be tested within the LeetCode platform which provides the `BinaryMatrix` interface.

```

Detailed Explanation:
1. **Dimension Retrieval**: First, retrieve the number of rows and columns using the `binaryMatrix.dimensions()` method.

2. **Initialization**: Start from the top-right corner of the matrix. Initialize a variable `left_most_col` to `-1` which will store the left-most column index containing `1`.

3. **Matrix Traversal**:
   - If the value at the current position `binaryMatrix.get(row, col)` is `1`, update `left_most_col` (since this column now contains a `1`), and move left `(col -= 1)` to check if there is any column to the left that contains `1`.
   - If the value is `0`, traverse downwards `(row += 1)` to check the next row.

4. **Result**: Continue the traversal until either you run out of columns or rows. After finishing the loop, `left_most_col` will contain either the index of the left-most column with a '1', or it will stay as `-1` if no '1' is present in the matrix.

This approach minimizes the number of accesses to the matrix, making it highly efficient and suitable given the problem constraints.

# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

### Problem Description 
Given the array `candies` and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.


Example 1:
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

Example 2:
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.


Example 3:
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]

Constraints:
`2 <= candies.length <= 100`
`1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
`1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

### Solution 
 Here's the Python code solution for the proposed problem using the LeetCode format. The provided explanation details the logic behind the solution.



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        # Find the current maximum number of candies any kid has
        maxCandies = max(candies)
        
        # Initialize a result list to store the results for each kid
        result = []
        
        # Iterating through each kid in the candies list
        for count in candies:
            # Check if giving extra candies to the current kid can make
            # or match the maximum candies count
            if count + extraCandies >= maxCandies:
                result.append(True)
            else:
                result.append(False)
    
        return result

# Example Usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.kidsWithCandies([2, 3, 5, 1, 3], 3)) # Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
print(sol.kidsWithCandies([4, 2, 1, 1, 2], 1)) # Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
print(sol.kidsWithCandies([12, 1, 12], 10)) # Output: [true,false,true]

```

### Explanation
1. **Max Candies Calculation**: First, we determine the maximum number of candies that any kid currently holds using Python's built-in `max()` function.
2. **Result List**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store boolean values on whether each kid can or cannot have the most candies after potentially receiving the `extraCandies`.
3. **Logic Iteration**: For each kid in the `candies` array, we add `extraCandies` to the current candy count of a kid and check if it is equal to or greater than `maxCandies`. If true, append `True` to `result`; otherwise, append `False`.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list, which comprises the boolean values indicating whether each kid can have the greatest number of candies.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `candies` list, because we are iterating through the list a fixed number of times and performing constant-time operations within the loop. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage requirements of the `result` list that stores n boolean values.

# 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums` of 0s and 1s and an integer `k`, return `True` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `False`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 0
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1], k = 1
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`0 <= k <= nums.length`
`nums[i]` is `0` or `1`

### Solution 
 The primary goal of our problem is to check if all the occurrences of 1 in the array `nums` are at least `k` indices apart from each other. A straightforward approach to solve this problem is by traversing the array and tracking the indices of the 1s, subsequently ensuring that the difference between consecutive indices of 1s is greater than or equal to `k`. 

Here's how we can solve it:

1. Initialize a variable to store the index of the last seen 1 (e.g., `last_index`), setting it to some value like `-k-1` initially to handle edge cases where the first 1 appears early in the array.
2. Traverse the array `nums`:
   - If we encounter a 1, check the distance from the last 1 (if any).
   - If the distance is less than `k`, return `False`.
   - If valid, update the `last_index` to the current index.
3. If the entire array is processed without violations, return `True`.

Now, let's implement this approach in Python as per the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # the position of the last found 1 in the list
        last_index = -k - 1
        
        # go through each number in the list
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num == 1:  # when we find a 1
                if i - last_index <= k:  # check the distance from the last 1
                    return False
                last_index = i  # update the last found 1's position
                
        return True

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.kLengthApart([1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], 2))  # Output: True
print(sol.kLengthApart([1,0,0,1,0,1], 2))       # Output: False
print(sol.kLengthApart([1,1,1,1,1], 0))         # Output: True
print(sol.kLengthApart([0,1,0,1], 1))           # Output: True

```

Explanation:
- We initialize `last_index` to `-k-1`, allowing us to accommodate the check when we encounter the first 1 without caring about array boundaries.
- We check each position: if it's 1, we verify its distance from the last 1.
- If any 1s are found to be closer than `k` indices apart, the function returns `False`.
- If no such pair of close 1s is found, the function returns `True`.

This solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in `nums`, and has a constant space complexity.

# 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.

[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.

[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.

[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.

[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.

[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.

[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.

[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.

[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
`0 <= limit <= 109`

### Solution 
 To tackle this problem, we can utilize a sliding window approach with the help of two deques to efficiently find the maximum and minimum within any given window:

1. **Using Deques for Efficiency**: A deque, or double-ended queue, allows us to insert and remove elements from both the front and the back of the queue in constant time. We will maintain two deques:
   - `maxDeque`: This will keep track of indices of the elements in a non-increasing order. The front will always have the index of the maximum element in the current window.
   - `minDeque`: This will keep track of indices of the elements in a non-decreasing order. The front will always have the index of the minimum element in the current window.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - We expand the window by adding elements from the right.
   - Upon adding a new element:
     - For `maxDeque`, remove all elements from the back that are less than the new element, and then add the new element.
     - For `minDeque`, remove all elements from the back that are greater than the new element, and then add the new element.
   - Check if the current window is valid, i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum is within the limit:
     - If true, try to expand the window further.
     - If false, contract the window from the left until it becomes valid again.

3. **Length Calculation**:
   - Throughout the process, maintain a variable to track the length of the longest valid window encountered.

This approach allows us to process each element a limited number of times, making the algorithm efficient.

Here's the Python code to implement the solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        from collections import deque
        
        maxDeque, minDeque = deque(), deque()
        longest = 0
        l = 0
        
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            # Maintain maxDeque
            while maxDeque and nums[maxDeque[-1]] < nums[r]:
                maxDeque.pop()
            maxDeque.append(r)
            
            # Maintain minDeque
            while minDeque and nums[minDeque[-1]] > nums[r]:
                minDeque.pop()
            minDeque.append(r)
            
            # Check if current window is valid
            while nums[maxDeque[0]] - nums[minDeque[0]] > limit:
                l += 1
                if l > maxDeque[0]:
                    maxDeque.popleft()
                if l > minDeque[0]:
                    minDeque.popleft()
            
            # Update longest length found
            longest = max(longest, r - l + 1)
        
        return longest

```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `longestSubarray`, which returns the size of the longest non-empty subarray meeting the specified condition. The sliding window technique combined with deques provides an efficient solution to this problem, supporting large input sizes as indicated in the constraints.

# 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays

### Problem Description 
Given two integer arrays of equal length `target` and `arr`.

In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return True if you can make `arr` equal to `target`, or False otherwise.


Example 1:
Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.


Example 2:
Input: target = [7], arr = [7]
Output: true
Explanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.


Example 3:
Input: target = [1,12], arr = [12,1]
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: arr doesn't have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.


Example 5:
Input: target = [1,1,1,1,1], arr = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: true

Constraints:
`target.length == arr.length`
`1 <= target.length <= 1000`
`1 <= target[i] <= 1000`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 The given problem can be reduced to checking whether both arrays, `target` and `arr`, can be made equivalent through rearrangement (since reversing subarrays is essentially rearranging). To establish if `arr` can be rearranged to match `target`, we need to ensure that both arrays contain exactly the same elements with the same frequencies.

We can achieve this using the following methods:
1. **Sorting**: If we sort both arrays and they become identical, then it's possible to rearrange `arr` to match `target`.
2. **Hash Table (Counting Frequency)**: We can use a hash table to count occurrences of each element in both arrays and compare these counts.

Here, we'll implement the second method for better efficiency, using Python's `collections.Counter` to count and compare the elements in both arrays. This method is preferred for larger input sizes because it avoids the overhead of sorting and directly compares the frequency of elements.

Here's the Python code implementing the solution:



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Counting frequency of elements in both target and arr
        target_count = Counter(target)
        arr_count = Counter(arr)
        
        # Compare the two counters
        return target_count == arr_count


```

### Explanation:
1. **Counter Objects**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to create frequency distribution objects for both `target` and `arr`.
2. **Comparison**: We then compare these `Counter` objects. In Python, two `Counter` objects are equal if and only if they have the same set of keys (elements) with the same corresponding counts (frequencies).
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the two `Counter` objects are equal, meaning `arr` can be rearranged to match `target`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the arrays, since constructing each `Counter` object and comparing them takes linear time relative to input size. This ensures that the solution will perform well even for the upper constraint of `target.length == 1000`.

# 1464. Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array

### Problem Description 
Given the array of integers `nums`, you will choose two different indices `i` and `j` of that array. Return the maximum value of `(nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1)`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,2]
Output: 12 
Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 = 12. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Choosing the indices i=1 and j=3 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value of (5-1)*(5-1) = 16.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,7]
Output: 12

Constraints:
`2 <= nums.length <= 500`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`

### Solution 
 Here's a Python program that solves the given problem. We'll take advantage of the fact that to maximize the product `(nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1)`, we simply need to find the two largest numbers in the array, since subtracting one from each won't change their order. This approach is efficient, as it avoids checking every possible combination.



```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initial conditions
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return 0  # edge case, should not happen based on problem constraints
        
        # Find the two largest numbers in the array
        # Initialize the two largest values
        top1 = top2 = float('-inf')
        
        for num in nums:
            if num > top1:
                top2, top1 = top1, num
            elif num > top2:
                top2 = num
        
        # Calculate the result as per the given formula
        result = (top1 - 1) * (top2 - 1)
        return result

# This class can be used for executing the function directly in a coderpad environment like LeetCode

```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Largest Values:** Instead of sorting the array which can have a time complexity of \(O(N \log N)\), we traverse the array only once to find the two largest values (`top1` and `top2`). This traversal has a time complexity of \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Traversing Efficiently:** 
   - We iterate through each number in the array.
   - If the current number is larger than `top1`, we update `top2` to be `top1`, and then set `top1` to the current number.
   - If the current number is not as large as `top1` but is larger than `top2`, we update `top2`.

3. **Computing the Result:** Once we have our two largest values, we plug them into the formula \((\text{top1} - 1) \times (\text{top2} - 1)\) to get the maximum product.

### Performance

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\) due to the single loop that finds the largest two numbers.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

This method is efficient and directly applicable for a wide range of input sizes given the problem constraints.

# 1465. Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts

### Problem Description 
Given a rectangular cake with height `h` and width `w`, and two arrays of integers `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where `horizontalCuts[i]` is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the `ith` horizontal cut and similarly, `verticalCuts[j]` is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the `jth` vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red lines are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the green piece of cake has the maximum area.


Example 2:
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3,1], verticalCuts = [1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red lines are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the green and yellow pieces of cake have the maximum area.


Example 3:
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3], verticalCuts = [3]
Output: 9

Constraints:
`2 <= h, w <= 10^9`
`1 <= horizontalCuts.length < min(h, 10^5)`
`1 <= verticalCuts.length < min(w, 10^5)`
`1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h`
`1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w`
It is guaranteed that all elements in `horizontalCuts` are distinct.

It is guaranteed that all elements in `verticalCuts` are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem effectively, we need to identify the largest gaps between consecutive cuts for both the horizontal and vertical cuts.

### Steps:

1. **Sort the Cuts**: First, sort both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` arrays. This will help us determine the size of the pieces that result from the cuts.
  
2. **Compute Maximum Gaps**:
    - For horizontal cuts, append `0` (top of the cake) and `h` (bottom of the cake) to the `horizontalCuts` array. Sort it and find the maximum difference between consecutive elements in this extended list. This difference represents the maximum height of the resulting pieces.
    - Similarly, for vertical cuts, append `0` (left of the cake) and `w` (right of the cake) to `verticalCuts`, sort, and find the maximum difference between consecutive elements. This difference represents the maximum width of the resulting pieces.

3. **Calculate Max Area**: Multiply the largest horizontal gap by the largest vertical gap to get the area of the largest piece. 

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the answer needs to be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\), take the modulo of the result to avoid overflow and to adhere to the constraints.

### Implementation:

Here is the Python code that follows the above logic, suitable for direct execution on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, h: int, w: int, horizontalCuts: List[int], verticalCuts: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Add boundaries and sort the cuts
        horizontalCuts.extend([0, h])
        verticalCuts.extend([0, w])
        horizontalCuts.sort()
        verticalCuts.sort()

        # Find the maximum gaps
        max_h_gap = max(horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(horizontalCuts)))
        max_v_gap = max(verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(verticalCuts)))

        # Calculate the maximum area of a piece (mod MOD)
        max_area = (max_h_gap * max_v_gap) % MOD
        
        return max_area

```

### Explanation:

- This code creates modifications directly on `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` by extending them with the edges of the cake (0 and respective dimensions).
- It sorts these lists and then computes maximum gaps by subtracting consecutive elements.
- The `maxArea` is calculated by multiplying the maximum gaps found in horizontal and vertical cuts.
- All these operations ensure that we are efficiently computing the desired result using sorting (O(n log n) for each array due to the sorting operation) and iterating through the array (O(n)), where `n` is the number of cuts in the specific direction. Given the constraints, this method will perform efficiently.

# 1470. Shuffle the Array

### Problem Description 
Given the array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]`.

Return the array in the form `[x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2
Output: [1,2,1,2]

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 500`
`nums.length == 2n`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`

### Solution 
 The problem statement describes a scenario where we are given an array structured as `[x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn]`, and we need to reorganize this array into the form `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]`. This transformation involves reordering the elements so that items from the first half and the second half of the array are alternated.

To accomplish this reordering, we can make use of Python's list slicing and straightforward looping:
- We will separate the first half of the list (representing the `x` values) and the second half (representing the `y` values).
- We instantiate a new list and populate it by alternatingly appending an element from the `x` list and then one from the `y` list.

Now, let's proceed by defining the function based on the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def shuffle(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
        x_part = nums[:n]   # First half (x values)
        y_part = nums[n:]   # Second half (y values)
        
        result = []
        for x, y in zip(x_part, y_part):
            result.append(x)
            result.append(y)
        
        return result

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Input and Output:** This function takes in the `nums` array and an integer `n`. It returns the reorganized list.
2. **Variable Definitions:**
   - `x_part` contains the first n elements of `nums`.
   - `y_part` contains the last n elements of `nums`.
   - `result` will store the combined result.
3. **Looping Mechanism:** `zip(x_part, y_part)` binds each element from `x_part` and `y_part` together in pairs. For each pair `(x, y)`, we add `x` then `y` to the `result` list.
4. **Output the Result:** Finally the reorganized list is returned.

This organization and method ensure that the sequence is rearranged in the required format and adheres to the constraints given in the problem statement.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the value given, because the loop iterates n times to combine elements.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), considering the space required for the `result` array (in addition to the input list, if that does not count toward extra space). If only extra space is considered, then the space complexity is O(n) due to the `result` list. If list slicing counts for space (which creates copies), this would increase but generally matches problem constraints.

# 1471. The k Strongest Values in an Array

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.

A value `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|` where `m` is the median of the array.

If `|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|`, then `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than `arr[j]` if `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

Return a list of the strongest `k` values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position `((n - 1) / 2)` in the sorted list (0-indexed).

For `arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11]`, `n = 5` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2`. The median is `6`.

For `arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3]`, `n = 4` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1`. The median is `3`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.

Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
Output: [5,5]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].


Example 3:
Input: arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5
Output: [11,8,6,6,7]
Explanation: Median is 7, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [11,8,6,6,7,7].

Any permutation of [11,8,6,6,7] is accepted.


Example 4:
Input: arr = [6,-3,7,2,11], k = 3
Output: [-3,11,2]

Example 5:
Input: arr = [-7,22,17,3], k = 2
Output: [22,17]

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
`-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`
`1 <= k <= arr.length`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we'll take the following steps:

1. Calculate the median value of the input array.
2. Compute the "strength" of each array element relative to the median determined. This is based on the distance from the median, \( |arr[i] - m| \).
3. Sort the elements of the array by their strength. If two elements have the same strength, we'll further sort them by their actual values.
4. Return the top `k` strongest elements from this sorted list.

Given that Python supports sorting with custom keys by a tuple of order criteria, we can achieve our custom sorted list using a simple call to `sorted()`. This accommodates both the primary sorting criteria (strength, based on distance from median) as well as the tie-breaking criterion (actual values of the elements).

Here's the Python code that executes the above plan:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def getStrongest(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Sort the array and find the median
        arr.sort()
        n = len(arr)
        m = arr[(n - 1) // 2]  # median value
        
        # Step 2: Sort the array by the strength criteria
        # -Main factor: Absolute difference from median
        # -Tiebreaker: Value itself
        arr.sort(key=lambda x: (abs(x - m), x), reverse=True)
        
        # Step 3: Return the first k elements (the k strongest)
        return arr[:k]

# Examples for testing
sol = Solution()
print(sol.getStrongest([1,2,3,4,5], k=2))  # Output: [5, 1] or any permutation
print(sol.getStrongest([1,1,3,5,5], k=2))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(sol.getStrongest([6,7,11,7,6,8], k=5))  # Output: [11, 8, 6, 6, 7] or any permutation
print(sol.getStrongest([6,-3,7,2,11], k=3))  # Output: [11, -3, 2] or any permutation
print(sol.getStrongest([-7,22,17,3], k=2))  # Output: [22, 17]

```

This Python code follows the format for submission in platforms like LeetCode:
- Define a `Solution` class.
- Within the `Solution` class, define the function `getStrongest` which:
  - Reads the list of integers `arr` and the integer `k`.
  - Executes the steps outlined to find and return the k strongest values in the list.
- Example cases are called for demonstration and testing, which can be commented out or removed before submitting to LeetCode.

# 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

### Problem Description 
Given the array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `ith` item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the `ith` item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the minimum index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the `ith` element is the final price you will pay for the `ith` item of the shop considering the special discount.


Example 1:
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.


Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.


Example 3:
Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]

Constraints:
`1 <= prices.length <= 500`
`1 <= prices[i] <= 10^3`

### Solution 
 Here's a Python code solution for the described discount problem using a monotonic stack approach. This choice of data structure allows efficient determination of the next smaller or equal price for each item.

Explanation:
- **Monotonic Stack**: The idea is to use a stack to keep track of indices where each element waits to find the next lesser or equal value. As we iterate over the array, for each new element we check whether the current element can serve as a next lesser price for the indices waiting in the stack.
- **Execution**:
  - Traverse through the array. For each item, continue popping from the stack if the stacked indices have prices greater than the current price.
  - After finding such indices, calculate their discounts using the current price.
  - Finally, add each index to the stack, waiting for its turn to find a suitable discount price.

Here's the modularized solution which directly fits into the format used for leetcode submissions:



```python
class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []  # This will contain indices of prices array
        discount_prices = prices.copy()  # To store the final prices after discount
        
        for i, price in enumerate(prices):
            # Resolve all previous prices waiting in the stack for a discount
            while stack and prices[stack[-1]] >= price:
                index = stack.pop()
                discount_prices[index] = prices[index] - price
            # Push the current index on the stack
            stack.append(i)
        
        # Any remaining items in stack receive no discount; already handled by copying
        return discount_prices

# Usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.finalPrices([8,4,6,2,3]))  # Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
# print(sol.finalPrices([1,2,3,4,5]))  # Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(sol.finalPrices([10,1,1,6]))   # Output: [9,0,1,6]

```

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**: `stack` to hold indices and `discount_prices` initialized to original `prices`.
2. **Iterate Over Prices**: For each price:
   - **Check Stack Top for Discount**: While the last index's price in the stack can receive the current price as a discount, pop the stack and update the `discount_prices` accordingly.
   - **Add Current Index to Stack**: If the current item cannot provide a discount for the last item in the stack, add it to the stack for future discount potential.
3. **Final Price Array**: Immediately available as items either find their discounts inside the loop or are implicitly undiscounted if they remain discounted with self value.

The above algorithm runs in O(n) time as each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once. The use of a stack ensures we efficiently track potential discounts without excess computation.

# 1476. Subrectangle Queries

### Problem Description 
Implement the class `SubrectangleQueries` which receives a `rows x cols` rectangle as a matrix of integers in the constructor and supports two methods:
1.` updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)`
Updates all values with `newValue` in the subrectangle whose upper left coordinate is `(row1,col1)` and bottom right coordinate is `(row2,col2)`.

2.` getValue(int row, int col)`
Returns the current value of the coordinate `(row,col)` from the rectangle.


Example 1:
Input
["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue"]
[[[[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]],[0,2],[0,0,3,2,5],[0,2],[3,1],[3,0,3,2,10],[3,1],[0,2]]
Output
[null,1,null,5,5,null,10,5]
Explanation
SubrectangleQueries subrectangleQueries = new SubrectangleQueries([[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]);  
// The initial rectangle (4x3) looks like:
// 1 2 1
// 4 3 4
// 3 2 1
// 1 1 1
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 3, 2, 5);
// After this update the rectangle looks like:
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5 
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 5
subrectangleQueries.getValue(3, 1); // return 5
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(3, 0, 3, 2, 10);
// After this update the rectangle looks like:
// 5   5   5
// 5   5   5
// 5   5   5
// 10  10  10 
subrectangleQueries.getValue(3, 1); // return 10
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 5

Example 2:
Input
["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue"]
[[[[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]],[0,0],[0,0,2,2,100],[0,0],[2,2],[1,1,2,2,20],[2,2]]
Output
[null,1,null,100,100,null,20]
Explanation
SubrectangleQueries subrectangleQueries = new SubrectangleQueries([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 0); // return 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 2, 2, 100);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 0); // return 100
subrectangleQueries.getValue(2, 2); // return 100
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(1, 1, 2, 2, 20);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(2, 2); // return 20

Constraints:
There will be at most `500` operations considering both methods: `updateSubrectangle` and `getValue`.

`1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
`rows == rectangle.length`
`cols == rectangle[i].length`
`0 <= row1 <= row2 < rows`
`0 <= col1 <= col2 < cols`
`1 <= newValue, rectangle[i][j] <= 10^9`
`0 <= row < rows`
`0 <= col < cols`

### Solution 
 The problem requires us to implement a class `SubrectangleQueries` that can update values in a subrectangle (specified by its top-left and bottom-right corners) of a matrix and fetch values from the matrix at specified coordinates.

We will construct this class with the following two main functionalities: `updateSubrectangle` and `getValue`.

Here's the step-by-step Python code:



```python
class SubrectangleQueries:
    def __init__(self, rectangle):
        """
        Initializes the object with the rectangle and store it.
        """
        # Deep copy the rectangle to avoid mutation issues
        self.rectangle = [row[:] for row in rectangle]

    def updateSubrectangle(self, row1, col1, row2, col2, newValue):
        """
        Updates all values with newValue in the subrectangle whose
        upper left coordinate is (row1, col1) and bottom right coordinate is (row2, col2).
        """
        # Loop through the specified subrectangle and update the cells
        for row in range(row1, row2 + 1):
            for col in range(col1, col2 + 1):
                self.rectangle[row][col] = newValue

    def getValue(self, row, col):
        """
        Returns the current value of the coordinate (row, col) from the rectangle.
        """
        # Return the value at the specified cell
        return self.rectangle[row][col]

# Your SubrectangleQueries object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = SubrectangleQueries(rectangle)
# param_1 = obj.getValue(row,col)
# obj.updateSubrectangle(row1,col1,row2,col2,newValue)

```

In this class:
1. `__init__(self, rectangle)`: Constructor that initializes with a 2D list representing the matrix/rectangle.
2. `updateSubrectangle(self, row1, col1, row2, col2, newValue)`: Method to update all values within the specified subrectangle to `newValue`.
3. `getValue(self, row, col)`: Method that returns the value at a specific location within the matrix.

### Example Usage:


```python
subrectangleQueries = SubrectangleQueries([[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]])
print(subrectangleQueries.getValue(0,2))  # Output: 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0,0,3,2,5)  # Update subrectangle
print(subrectangleQueries.getValue(0,2))  # Output: 5
print(subrectangleQueries.getValue(3,1))  # Output: 5
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(3,0,3,2,10)  # Update subrectangle
print(subrectangleQueries.getValue(3,1))  # Output: 10
print(subrectangleQueries.getValue(0,2))  # Output: 5

```

This solution takes advantage of direct updates, ensuring that both `updateSubrectangle` and `getValue` operations are efficient. It avoids advanced data structures because the size limits (1 <= rows, cols <= 100) do not necessitate more complex optimizations.

# 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]...nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].


Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
`-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution for the problem along with detailed comments and explanations. This code can be directly executed on LeetCode under the type of problems that require you to define a function that returns the solution.



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Calculate running sums for the input array.
        
        Args:
        nums (List[int]): The list of numbers for which to compute the running sums.
        
        Returns:
        List[int]: A list containing the running sums.
        """
        
        # Initialize an empty list for the running sums
        running_sum = []
        
        # Initialize a variable to store the cumulative sum so far
        current_sum = 0
        
        # Iterate through each number in the input list
        for num in nums:
            # Update the cumulative sum with the current number
            current_sum += num
            # Append the cumulative sum to the running sum list
            running_sum.append(current_sum)
        
        # Return the list of running sums
        return running_sum

# Following code is for the demonstration purposes, to show how class can be used:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.runningSum([1,2,3,4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]
# print(sol.runningSum([1,1,1,1,1]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# print(sol.runningSum([3,1,2,10,1])) # Output: [3, 4, 6, 16, 17]

```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Class Definition**:
   - A class `Solution` is defined as per a typical LeetCode solution format.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - Inside `Solution`, a method `runningSum` is defined, which takes `nums` (a list of integers) as an argument and returns a list of integers.

3. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The method initializes an empty list called `running_sum` to store the running sums.
   - It also initializes `current_sum` to zero, which keeps track of the accumulated sum while iterating through the list.
   - For each number in the list `nums`, it adds the number to `current_sum` and then appends `current_sum` to `running_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns the `running_sum` list containing all the running sums.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums`, since it passes through the list exactly once. This meets the problem's constraints and is suitable for direct execution on LeetCode platforms.
