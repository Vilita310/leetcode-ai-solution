# 1805. Number of Different Integers in a String

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `word` that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, `"a123bc34d8ef34"` will become `" 123  34 8  34"`. Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: `"123"`, `"34"`, `"8"`, and `"34"`.

Return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on `word`.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.


Example 1:
Input: word = "a123bc34d8ef34"
Output: 3
Explanation: The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.


Example 2:
Input: word = "leet1234code234"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: word = "a1b01c001"
Output: 1
Explanation: The three integers "1", "01", and "001" all represent the same integer because
the leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.


Constraints:
`1 <= word.length <= 1000`
`word` consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting distinct integers from the given string after replacing non-digit characters with spaces, we can follow these steps:

1. **Replace Non-Digit Characters**: Convert every character in the string that is not a digit to a space. This creates a clean separation between potential integer values.

2. **Split the Cleaned String**: Use the space as a delimiter to split the string into a list of substrings that represent integers.

3. **Remove Leading Zeros**: For each integer substring, remove any leading zeros to normalize the representation. This is crucial because "01", "001", and "1" should all be counted as the same integer.

4. **Use a Set for Uniqueness**: Store these normalized integers in a set, which inherently handles uniqueness for us. 

5. **Count Distinct Integers**: Finally, return the size of the set, which gives us the count of distinct integers.

Here's the Python code implementing the above logic, structured in a way that can be directly run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def numDifferentIntegers(self, word: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Replace all non-digit characters with space
        for char in word:
            if not char.isdigit():
                word = word.replace(char, ' ')
        
        # Step 2: Split the string by spaces to get individual integer strings
        nums = word.split()
        
        # Step 3: Normalize the integers by stripping leading zeros and storing them in a set
        unique_numbers = set()
        for num in nums:
            # Remove leading zeros using int conversion, and convert back to string
            # This automatically handles cases like "001", "01" by converting them to "1"
            if num:  # Check if the string is not empty
                unique_numbers.add(str(int(num)))
        
        # Step 4: Return the number of unique integers
        return len(unique_numbers)

# Example usage
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.numDifferentIntegers("a123bc34d8ef34"))  # Output: 3
# print(sol.numDifferentIntegers("leet1234code234"))  # Output: 2
# print(sol.numDifferentIntegers("a1b01c001"))        # Output: 1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `numDifferentIntegers` that takes a string `word` as input.
- The first loop goes through each character in the string and replaces non-digit characters with spaces.
- We split the resulting string on spaces to obtain a list `nums`, which contains the potential integer substrings.
- By iterating through each substring, we convert it to an integer (which strips any leading zeros) and then add it back to a set. This handles duplicates automatically.
- Finally, we return the length of the set as the count of distinct integers.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the word. We iterate through the string and perform operations that are linear with respect to its size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique integers stored in the set, which can be at most n in the worst case.

This solution efficiently counts distinct integers in the given string as per the problem requirements.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you've mentioned a problem related to SQL Schema but didn't provide specific details about the problem you want to solve. SQL Schema problems typically involve making queries related to database tables. 

### Example Problem

Let’s assume a common problem related to SQL schema, such as retrieving a user’s information based on a criterion. Here’s an example where we will query a `Users` table to find users above a certain age.

Given the SQL schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    UserName VARCHAR(255),
    Age INT
);

```

### Example Problem Statement

"Write a SQL query to find all users who are older than 30."

### SQL Query Solution

Here's the SQL query that can solve this problem:


```sql
SELECT UserId, UserName, Age
FROM Users
WHERE Age > 30;

```

### Explanation of the SQL Query

1. **SELECT Clause**: This part of the query specifies the columns we want to retrieve. In this case, we want `UserId`, `UserName`, and `Age` from the `Users` table.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: This indicates the table from which we are retrieving the data. Here, we are getting the data from the `Users` table.

3. **WHERE Clause**: This is the filter criteria for our query. We only want records where the `Age` is greater than 30.

### Conclusion

However, if you have a specific SQL query or example you would like assistance with, including the schema and requirements, please provide the details, and I will craft a tailored SQL query solution.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like your question was cut off and you did not provide the problem statement or the SQL schema. However, I can give you a template for a LeetCode solution in Python. You can later replace the outline with your specific logic based on the problem you're trying to solve.

### LeetCode Solution Template

When you want to solve a problem on LeetCode, you typically need to define a class with a specific function. I will provide a generic example, and you can modify the logic inside based on your problem's requirements.

### Example Problem Structure

Assuming we're solving a hypothetical problem where you're needing to return a sorted list of numbers.

**Example Problem: Given an unsorted list of integers, return the sorted list.**

Here's how you can write a solution for it.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Sorts an input list of integers in non-decreasing order.
        
        :param nums: List[int] - the input list of integers.
        :return: List[int] - the sorted list of integers.
        """
        # Here we can use Python's built-in sorting functions for simplicity.
        return sorted(nums)

# Example of usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test the function with an example input
    test_case = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
    print("Sorted Array:", solution.sortArray(test_case))

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**:
    - We define a class called `Solution`, which is a standard format for writing LeetCode solutions.

2. **Function Definition**:
    - Inside the class, we define a function `sortArray` which takes a parameter `nums`, a list of integers. The type hint specifies that `nums` should be a list of integers and the return type will also be a list of integers.

3. **Sorting Logic**:
    - We utilize Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list from the specified iterable.
  
4. **Main Block**:
    - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used for testing the function directly. This can help in testing different scenarios outside of the LeetCode platform before submission.

5. **Test Case**:
    - We created a test case and printed the sorted version of the input list to demonstrate the functionality.

### How to Proceed with Your Problem

1. **Replace the Problem Logic**:
    - Insert the logic specific to your problem inside the function where sorting is being done.
  
2. **SQL Context**:
    - If you are dealing with a SQL-related problem, you might want to describe how to transform the data first within Python, if applicable (though generally SQL solutions denote relational database queries rather than direct Python).

3. **Test Scenarios**:
    - Ensure to test several cases, including edge cases to confirm the logic is sound.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like your message was cut off. You mentioned a "SQL Schema," but there is no specific problem description provided. However, I can show you a general approach on how to solve problems on LeetCode that involve SQL schemas, or if you give me more details (like a specific problem statement), I can help you solve it accordingly.

For SQL-related problems on LeetCode, typically, you are given a scenario with tables and are required to write an SQL query that produces a specific output. The format generally involves writing a multi-line SQL statement that adheres to SQL syntax.

Here’s an example of how to format a SQL solution for a fictional problem. Let's assume the problem requires us to find the names of users who have made more than one order from a `Users` and `Orders` table.

### Problem Statement:
We have two tables as follows:

**Users Table**
- `userId` (Primary Key)
- `name`

**Orders Table**
- `orderId` (Primary Key)
- `userId` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
- `amount`

The goal is to find the names of users who have placed more than one order.

### SQL Solution:


```sql
SELECT u.name
FROM Users u
JOIN Orders o ON u.userId = o.userId
GROUP BY u.userId, u.name
HAVING COUNT(o.orderId) > 1;

```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT u.name**: This selects the `name` column from the `Users` table (aliased as `u`).
2. **FROM Users u**: We are using the `Users` table and giving it an alias `u` for easier reference.
3. **JOIN Orders o ON u.userId = o.userId**: This joins the `Users` table with the `Orders` table (aliased as `o`) on the foreign key relationship, where `userId` from the `Users` table matches `userId` in the `Orders` table.
4. **GROUP BY u.userId, u.name**: We group the results by `userId` and `name` to aggregate the orders for each user.
5. **HAVING COUNT(o.orderId) > 1**: Finally, we filter those groups to include only users who have more than one corresponding order by counting the `orderId`.

### Running the Code:
This SQL code needs to be placed in the SQL query editor on the LeetCode platform. The platform will execute this code against its dataset based on the schema defined in the problem statement.

If you provide specific details about the problem statement, I'd be glad to assist you further, such as generating a proper SQL query or even a Python-based solution if applicable!
