# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you've started to describe a problem but have not provided the complete problem statement or the SQL schema. However, I can provide you with a general format for how to tackle a problem on LeetCode, including how to handle SQL problems.

### Example LeetCode Problem Breakdown

Let's assume we are dealing with a SQL problem that requires retrieving specific data from tables. I'll create a fictitious example based on typical LeetCode SQL problems to illustrate the format.

### Problem Description
You are given two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`. The `Employees` table has the following schema:


```sql
 Employees
 +-------------+---------+
 | Column      | Type    |
 +-------------+---------+
 | employee_id | int     |
 | name        | varchar  |
 | department_id | int   |
 +-------------+---------+

```

The `Departments` table looks like this:


```sql
 Departments
 +--------------+---------+
 | Column       | Type    |
 +--------------+---------+
 | department_id| int     |
 | department_name| varchar|
 +--------------+---------+

```

Write a SQL query to find the names of all employees along with their respective department names. If an employee does not belong to any department, return 'No department'.

### Solution Format

To provide a solution, we utilize a SQL `LEFT JOIN` which allows us to get all employees, regardless of whether they have a corresponding department.

Here's how the solution would be structured:


```sql
SELECT 
    e.name AS employee_name,
    IFNULL(d.department_name, 'No department') AS department_name
FROM 
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN 
    Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

```

### Explanation
1. **SELECT Statement**: We start by selecting the employee's name and the department name. The `AS` keyword is used to provide aliases for our output column names.
  
2. **LEFT JOIN**: We are joining the `Employees` table with the `Departments` table on the condition that the `department_id` of the `Employees` table is equal to the `department_id` of the `Departments` table. This ensures that all employees are retained in the result set, even if they do not belong to a department.

3. **IFNULL Function**: This function checks if the department name is `NULL` (meaning the employee does not have a corresponding department in the `Departments` table). If it is `NULL`, we replace it with 'No department'.

### Conclusion

This structure ensures that our SQL solution adheres to the necessary requirements and will run directly on the LeetCode platform. Make sure to adapt the SQL to your specific problem as needed, and adjust the table and column names according to the actual problem description. If you provide me with the specific problem statement and schema, I would be able to write a more tailored solution.

# 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 To assist you effectively, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding regarding the "SQL Schema" problem. SQL schemas typically require handling data queries and manipulations using SQL rather than Python. However, if you provide me with the details of a specific LeetCode problem (whether it involves SQL, data structures, algorithms, etc.), I can help devise a solution in Python and format it according to LeetCode’s requirements.

Assuming your request is for a Python algorithm to solve a given problem, I'll create an example problem with a solution in the required format. Let's say we're solving a problem where we need to find the maximum subarray sum (a classic problem).

### Problem: Maximum Subarray

**Description:**
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example:**

Input: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = 6.  

### Python Solution



```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Function to find the maximum subarray sum.
        
        Parameters:
            nums (List[int]): List of integers representing the array.
        
        Returns:
            int: The maximum sum of the contiguous subarray.
        """

        # Initialize current sum and maximum sum
        current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]

        # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
        for num in nums[1:]:
            # If current sum is negative, start a new sum with the current number
            # Otherwise, add the current number to the current sum
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            
            # Update the maximum sum if the current sum is greater
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

        return max_sum

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution`, which is required by LeetCode for encapsulating the solution.

2. **Method Definition**: The `maxSubArray` method takes a list of integers `nums` as input.

3. **Initialization**: We set `current_sum` and `max_sum` to the first element of the array. This assumes that there's at least one number in the input list.

4. **Iteration**: We loop through the `nums` starting from the second element. For each element:
   - We decide whether to continue with the previous accumulated `current_sum` or start a new subarray with the current number based on which is larger.
   - We update `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum found so far.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, we return `max_sum`, which holds the maximum sum of contiguous subarray found.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. We traverse the list only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of space for variables.

This implementation can be directly copied to the LeetCode platform and run, given the constraints of the problem. If you have a specific SQL schema-related problem or any other questions, please provide the details so I can assist you perfectly.

# 574. Winning Candidate

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you're looking for help with a LeetCode problem related to SQL and accompanying Python code. However, I don’t see the specific problem statement or SQL schema you have in mind. 

If you could provide the details about the problem and any specific requirements, I would be glad to help you construct a solution in Python, following the format suitable for LeetCode.

In the meantime, here is a general format used for solving LeetCode problems in Python, which often includes:

1. **Problem Statement** - Briefly describe the problem.
2. **Plan** - Outline the steps you will take to solve the problem.
3. **Code** - Provide the actual Python code.
4. **Complexity Analysis** - Discuss the time and space complexity.

Here’s an example format with a dummy problem:

### Example Problem:
**Problem**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

### Plan:
1. Create a dictionary to store the numbers and their indices.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. For each number, calculate the complement needed to reach the target.
4. Check if this complement exists in the dictionary; if so, return the indices.
5. If not, store the number and its index in the dictionary.

### Code:


```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_map = {}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], index]
            num_map[num] = index

```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because we might store up to n elements in the dictionary.

Please provide the specific problem and schema, and I can help you produce the code following this structure!

# 577. Employee Bonus

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like your request for the SQL Schema is incomplete, which means I can't create a specific solution. However, I can walk you through a generic approach to create a Python solution that is commonly used for problems you might find on LeetCode, particularly those dealing with SQL schemas.

In LeetCode, problems might often ask us to solve a query using an SQL schema provided in the problem description. Since we are geared towards Python, let's consider an example where we use Python to manipulate data as if we were to query from the database tables.

**Hypothetical Problem Example:**

Assume you have the following SQL schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    city VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);

```

You are asked to write a Python function to find all users who have placed orders totaling more than a specified amount.

**LeetCode solution format example:**

Here is an example Python code that simulates such a scenario:



```python
class Solution:
    def findUsersWithHighOrders(self, users, orders, amount_threshold):
        # Create a dictionary to aggregate order totals by user id
        order_totals = {}
        
        # Sum up the order amounts per user
        for order in orders:
            user_id = order[1]  # Assuming order[1] is user_id
            order_amount = order[2]  # Assuming that order[2] is the amount
            if user_id in order_totals:
                order_totals[user_id] += order_amount
            else:
                order_totals[user_id] = order_amount
        
        # Prepare a list to store users who meet the criteria
        qualifying_users = []
        
        # Check each user against the order totals
        for user in users:
            user_id = user[0]  # Assuming user[0] is id
            if user_id in order_totals and order_totals[user_id] > amount_threshold:
                qualifying_users.append(user[1])  # Assuming user[1] is name
        
        return qualifying_users

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
users = [(1, "Alice", 30, "New York"), (2, "Bob", 25, "Los Angeles"), (3, "Charlie", 35, "Chicago")]
orders = [(1, 1, 150.00), (2, 1, 200.00), (3, 2, 100.00)]
amount_threshold = 200

print(solution.findUsersWithHighOrders(users, orders, amount_threshold))
# Output: ['Alice'] since Alice has orders totaling 350.00 which is > 200.

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**: We defined a method `findUsersWithHighOrders` inside a class `Solution`. This method takes three parameters: `users`, `orders`, and `amount_threshold`.

2. **Data Structure for Totals**: We utilize a dictionary, `order_totals`, to keep track of the total order amounts for each user identified by their `user_id`.

3. **Populating the Order Totals**: We iterate through the `orders` list (assumed to be in a specific format), updating the `order_totals` dictionary with the total amounts for each user.

4. **Finding Qualifying Users**: After calculating the totals, we iterate through the `users` list to identify which users have total orders that exceed the specified `amount_threshold`.

5. **Result Collection**: We collect the qualifying user names in `qualifying_users` and return this list.

### Testing the Function:

To test the function, we create example input data (users and orders) and invoke the `findUsersWithHighOrders` method, then print the results.

This generic pattern can be applied to many problems involving data processing using SQL-like logic in Python code. If you provide specific details or a complete SQL schema alongside the problem context, I would be glad to tailor the solution more precisely to your needs.

# 578. Get Highest Answer Rate Question

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like your request is incomplete. To assist you with a coding problem, particularly for a LeetCode-style solution, I need to know the specifics of the problem you're dealing with, especially the SQL schema you referred to.

In general, on LeetCode, many problems involve database queries where you interact with tables and columns. If you can provide the complete problem statement, including the SQL schema and the specific question or requirement associated with it, I can help you craft a Python solution that fits the LeetCode format.

If you're asking about a specific SQL query problem, here's a general template on how SQL solutions are represented in Python, using the LeetCode format (specifically for problems where you might be asked to use an ORM or database querying technique):



```python
class Solution:
    def execute(self, query: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        # import necessary libraries
        import sqlite3
        
        # Connect to a SQLite database (temporary in-memory database for this example)
        conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
        
        # Create a cursor
        cur = conn.cursor()
        
        # Execute the provided SQL query
        cur.execute(query)
        
        # Fetch all results
        results = cur.fetchall()
        
        # Close the connection
        conn.close()
        
        # Return the results as a list of lists
        return results

```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The solution is wrapped inside a class named `Solution`, which is the expected format on LeetCode.

2. **Method Definition**: We define a method called `execute` that takes a SQL query as a string.

3. **SQLite Connection**: We utilize SQLite as a lightweight database for example purposes. In actual LeetCode problems involving databases, you might be dealing with different databases.

4. **Executing the Query**: We use `cur.execute(query)` to run the SQL command passed into the function.

5. **Fetching Results**: After executing the query, we retrieve all results using `cur.fetchall()`, which gives us all the rows returned by the query.

6. **Closing the Connection**: It’s important to close the database connection to avoid memory leaks.

7. **Return Statement**: The method returns the results in a format compatible with expected outputs in LeetCode (usually a list of lists).

To give you the best possible assistance, please provide the detailed problem statement, including the SQL schema and any requirements specified for the solution.

# 579. Find Cumulative Salary of an Employee

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like there might be some misunderstanding, as you haven’t provided details regarding the specific LeetCode problem or the SQL schema you're referring to. To assist you accurately, please provide the complete problem statement, including any SQL schema if applicable, and any examples given in the problem description.

However, I can lay out a general format for how we can approach a LeetCode problem. Let’s assume a hypothetical SQL problem and walk through how to structure it in Python as a solution.

### Example LeetCode Problem

Let’s assume we have a SQL problem where we are asked to write a query to select the names of all employees who earn more than their managers. Here's how we might outline the solution:

### SQL Schema

Assuming the following SQL schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Salary INT NOT NULL,
    ManagerId INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ManagerId) REFERENCES Employee(Id)
);

```

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we will write a SQL query that joins the `Employee` table with itself to compare the salary of each employee with their respective manager.

### SQL Query


```sql
SELECT e1.Name 
FROM Employee e1 
JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id 
WHERE e1.Salary > e2.Salary;

```

### Python Code Equivalent

Now, if we were to implement this logic in Python (for instance, if we were allowed to use an ORM like SQLAlchemy for a database) it could look like the following. However, please note that LeetCode generally requires SQL for SQL problems.



```python
class Solution:
    def higher_salary_employees(self):
        # Assuming we have a method to execute SQL queries
        query = """
        SELECT e1.Name 
        FROM Employee e1 
        JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id 
        WHERE e1.Salary > e2.Salary;
        """
        results = self.execute_query(query)
        return results

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query defined above selects the names of employees (`e1.Name`) from the `Employee` table.
2. **JOIN Operation**: We perform a self-join on the `Employee` table where we check if the `ManagerId` of an employee matches the `Id` of another employee (their manager).
3. **Filtering**: The WHERE clause filters those employees whose salaries are greater than that of their manager.
4. **Execution and Results**: In the class method, we're defining a hypothetical method to execute the SQL query and return the results.

### Note:

This code won't run directly on LeetCode without modifications if it has to be SQL based directly, as I used Python just for illustration of possible logic flow. 

### Conclusion:

Please provide the specific problem statement or any further details so that I can offer a tailored solution fitting your request.

# 580. Count Student Number in Departments

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like your message got cut off! I don't have the details of the SQL schema or the specific problem you want to be solved, which is critical for providing a relevant solution. However, I will guide you through the general format of a LeetCode solution in Python, using a sample problem as a reference.

Let's say the problem is "Find the nth Fibonacci number". Here's how you can structure your solution, along with a detailed explanation. When you're ready, please provide the details of the SQL schema and problem you'd like me to solve.

### Sample Problem: N-th Fibonacci Number

**Problem Statement**: Given an integer `n`, return the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

### SQL Schema (Not Applicable Here)

Since this is not an SQL problem, we will focus on a simple Python solution.

### Solution in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        """ 
        Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.
        
        The function uses an iterative approach for better performance.
        
        Args:
        n (int): An integer representing the position in the Fibonacci sequence.

        Returns:
        int: The n-th Fibonacci number.
        
        Example:
        Input: 4
        Output: 3
        """
        if n == 0:  
            return 0
        elif n == 1: 
            return 1
        
        a, b = 0, 1  # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b  # Update variables for the next Fibonacci number
            
        return b  # b contains the n-th Fibonacci number

```

### Explanation:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class named `Solution` since LeetCode uses this format to encapsulate the function.

2. **Function Signature**: The function `fib` takes one parameter, `n`, which corresponds to the position in the Fibonacci sequence.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, we return 0 because F(0) = 0.
   - If `n` is 1, we return 1 because F(1) = 1.

4. **Iterative Approach**:
   - We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to represent the first two Fibonacci numbers (F(0) and F(1)).
   - We use a loop starting from 2 up to `n`, updating `a` and `b` for each iteration. The next Fibonacci number is found by summing the previous two.
   
5. **Return Value**: Finally, we return `b`, which holds the value of F(n) after the loop completes.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we compute each Fibonacci number up to n.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use two variables for the computation.

### Example Usage:
To use the above solution, you just need to call the `fib` method of an instance of `Solution`:



```python
sol = Solution()
result = sol.fib(4)  # Should return 3

```

Please provide the specific details of the SQL schema and problem so I can assist you more accurately!

# 584. Find Customer Referee

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! However, it appears that your message was cut off after mentioning "SQL Schema". If you have a specific problem statement or SQL schema involving a coding problem (like LeetCode-style questions), please provide it so we can create a Python solution accordingly.

For now, let’s consider a commonly encountered SQL-related problem as an example.

### Problem Statement
Given a table `Employees` with the following fields:
- `Id`: the employee ID.
- `Name`: the employee name.
- `Salary`: the employee salary.
- `Department`: the department of the employee.

You need to write a SQL query to find the employees who earn more than the average salary in their department.

### Example Input
The input table may look like this:

| Id | Name    | Salary | Department |
|----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1  | Alice   | 70000  | IT         |
| 2  | Bob     | 60000  | IT         |
| 3  | Charlie | 50000  | HR         |
| 4  | David   | 60000  | HR         |

### Expected Output
The output should list the employees (with their names and salaries) who earn more than the average salary in their respective department.

| Name    | Salary |
|---------|--------|
| Alice   | 70000  |

### SQL Solution
To achieve the above requirement, we can write the following SQL query:


```sql
SELECT Name, Salary
FROM Employees e1
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e1.Department = e2.Department);

```

### Python Solution
If we were to implement this in Python to relate with handling data (since Python wouldn't execute SQL natively), we could either mimic the logic by manipulating a DataFrame (with pandas) or structure the logic to filter employee data programmatically.

However, since LeetCode's Python environment doesn't require this, we would implement SQL using a direct SQL approach only as per the given task.

If the focus is on coding in Python, here’s a hypothetical code representation of the logic used in the SQL query:



```python
def employees_above_average(employees):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Calculate average salaries per department
    department_salaries = defaultdict(list)
    
    for emp in employees:
        department_salaries[emp['Department']].append(emp['Salary'])
    
    average_salaries = {}
    for dept, salaries in department_salaries.items():
        average_salaries[dept] = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)
    
    # Step 2: Filter employees earning above department average
    result = []
    for emp in employees:
        if emp['Salary'] > average_salaries[emp['Department']]:
            result.append({'Name': emp['Name'], 'Salary': emp['Salary']})
    
    return result

# Example usage:
employees_list = [
    {'Id': 1, 'Name': 'Alice', 'Salary': 70000, 'Department': 'IT'},
    {'Id': 2, 'Name': 'Bob', 'Salary': 60000, 'Department': 'IT'},
    {'Id': 3, 'Name': 'Charlie', 'Salary': 50000, 'Department': 'HR'},
    {'Id': 4, 'Name': 'David', 'Salary': 60000, 'Department': 'HR'},
]

print(employees_above_average(employees_list))

```

### Explanation of the Python Approach:
1. **Data Structure**: We use a `defaultdict` to aggregate salaries by department.
2. **Average Calculation**: We compute the average salary for each department.
3. **Filtering**: We traverse the original list to check each employee's salary against their department's average to determine if they should be included in the output.

### Summary
The SQL query directly captures what we want to achieve in the dataset structurally, while the Python function detailed a way to explore similar logic using programming language constructs. Let me know if you have a specific problem or additional requirement!

# 585. Investments in 2016

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that you haven't provided the complete problem statement or SQL schema you're referring to. However, I can demonstrate how to structure an answer in Python that would adhere to the common format found on platforms like LeetCode, particularly for SQL-related questions. If you provide more details or a specific problem statement, I can tailor the code accordingly.

### Example Problem Statement:

Let's assume we have a problem to write a Python solution for a typical SQL-related task. For example, consider a problem that asks us to return a list of employees with their salaries sorted in descending order. Below is the Python code structured to fit the LeetCode format:

### LeetCode Python Solution Format:



```python
class Solution:
    def getEmployeesWithSalary(self, employees: List[Tuple[int, str, float]]) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
        """
        Given a list of employees where each employee is represented as a tuple 
        (employee_id, employee_name, salary), this function returns the list of 
        employees sorted by their salaries in descending order.

        :param employees: List of tuples (employee_id, employee_name, salary)
        :return: List of tuples (employee_name, salary) sorted by salary in descending order
        """
        # Sort the employees by salary in descending order
        employees_sorted = sorted(employees, key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        
        # Extract and return the required information (employee_name, salary)
        result = [(emp[1], emp[2]) for emp in employees_sorted]
        return result

# Example Usage:
# solution = Solution()
# employees = [(1, 'Alice', 60000), (2, 'Bob', 70000), (3, 'Charlie', 50000)]
# print(solution.getEmployeesWithSalary(employees))

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**: A method `getEmployeesWithSalary` is defined inside a class `Solution`. This follows the structure expected on platforms like LeetCode.

2. **Parameters**: The function accepts a list of tuples, with each tuple containing:
   - An employee ID (int)
   - An employee name (str)
   - An employee salary (float)

3. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list of employees based on their salary (the third element of each tuple). The `key` parameter specifies a lambda function that extracts the salary for sorting, and `reverse=True` sorts it in descending order.

4. **List Comprehension**: A list comprehension is used to create a new list that contains only the employee name and salary in the required format `(employee_name, salary)`.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the sorted list is returned.

6. **Example Usage**: An example is provided to show how to create an instance of `Solution` and call the function with sample data.

If you can provide the specific SQL schema or problem statement, I can refine the code and explanation to fit that context precisely!

 It looks like your request is somewhat incomplete regarding the actual problem statement to solve in Python. You mentioned an SQL Schema, but without a specific problem description, I can't provide a relevant solution.

If you can provide the specific problem or question you're looking to solve (like a particular SQL query, data manipulation task, or a scenario involving an SQL Schema), I would be glad to help! Also, please let me know if it needs to be a specific programming paradigm or algorithm in Python. 

Once I have that information, I will provide a detailed explanation, a Python code solution, and ensure it follows a format suitable for platforms like LeetCode.

# 589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 104`
The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of performing a preorder traversal of an n-ary tree, we need to utilize a depth-first search approach. The goal is to visit each node in the tree in the order of root node first, followed by all of its children from left to right.

### Explanation:
1. **N-ary Tree Definition**: An n-ary tree can have zero or more children. Each node in this tree will have a value and a list of references to its children.

2. **Preorder Traversal**: This means we visit the root first, then recursively visit each child node. For an iterative solution, we can use a stack to keep track of nodes to process.

3. **Iterative vs Recursive**: While a recursive approach is straightforward, we need to implement an iterative version which involves:
   - Using a stack data structure to keep track of the nodes we need to visit.
   - As we pop nodes from the stack, we visit each node (adding its value to the result list) and push its children onto the stack in reverse order (to maintain the correct left-to-right processing).

### Python Code:
Here is the Python code following the LeetCode format which is designed to run directly on the LeetCode website:



```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

class Solution:
    def preorder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[int]:
        if root is None:
            return []
        
        result = []
        stack = [root]
        
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            result.append(node.val)
            # Add children to the stack in reversed order
            stack.extend(reversed(node.children))
        
        return result

```

### Code Explanation:
1. **Node Class**: We define a class `Node` representing a single node in the n-ary tree. Each node has a value (`val`) and a list of children (`children`).

2. **Solution Class**: Within the `Solution` class, we implement the `preorder` method:
   - **Initial Check**: We first check if the `root` is `None`. If it is, we return an empty list since there are no nodes to traverse.
   - **Stack Initialization**: We initialize a stack with the root node.
   - **Traversal Loop**: We use a while loop to continue traversing until there are no nodes left in the stack:
     - Pop a node from the stack, appending its value to the result list.
     - Extend the stack with its children in reverse order to maintain the left-to-right traversal order.
   
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list containing the values of the nodes in preorder traversal.

This efficient approach ensures we process each node and all of its children correctly while handling large trees with depth effectively within the constraints provided.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It appears that your message got cut off and did not include specific details about the SQL schema or the problem you want to solve. However, since you mentioned "LeetCode" and typically they provide problems regarding data manipulation, I will assume that you're looking for a problem that can be solved using SQL and then perhaps transformed into a Python solution that utilizes a similar logical flow.

I'll create a sample SQL-related problem and then provide a Python solution for it. Let's assume the problem is about retrieving information from a database of employees.

### Problem Statement:

You have a table `Employees` with the following schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary INT,
    department_id INT
);

```

You need to write a SQL query to find the second highest salary from the `Employees` table. Return the value as `SecondHighestSalary`. If there is no second highest salary, return `NULL`.

### SQL Solution:

Here is a SQL query that accomplishes this:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

```

### Explanation of SQL Query:

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT salary AS SecondHighestSalary`**: This part selects the unique salaries from the `Employees` table and aliases it as `SecondHighestSalary`.
2. **`FROM Employees`**: This specifies that we are selecting from the `Employees` table.
3. **`ORDER BY salary DESC`**: This orders the salaries in descending order so that the highest salary comes first.
4. **`LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1`**: This limits the results to just one entry, while skipping the first entry (the highest salary). The result we get is the second highest salary.

### Python Code Equivalent:

If you were to solve a similar problem using a list of dictionaries in Python (representing the `Employees` table), you can use the following code:



```python
def second_highest_salary(employees):
    # Extract unique salaries using a set
    unique_salaries = set()
    for emp in employees:
        unique_salaries.add(emp['salary'])
    
    # Convert the set to a sorted list
    sorted_salaries = sorted(unique_salaries, reverse=True)

    # Check if there is a second highest salary
    if len(sorted_salaries) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted_salaries[1]

# Example usage
employees = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'salary': 2000, 'department_id': 1},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob', 'salary': 3000, 'department_id': 1},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'Charlie', 'salary': 3000, 'department_id': 2},
    {'id': 4, 'name': 'David', 'salary': 1000, 'department_id': 2}
]

print(second_highest_salary(employees))  # Output: 2000

```

### Explanation of Python Code:

1. **`def second_highest_salary(employees):`**: The function definition takes a list of dictionaries as input.
2. **`unique_salaries = set()`**: We use a set to keep track of unique salaries since sets automatically filter duplicates.
3. **Iterate over the `employees` list**: For each employee dictionary, we extract the `salary` and add it to the `unique_salaries` set.
4. **`sorted_salaries = sorted(unique_salaries, reverse=True)`**: We convert the set to a sorted list in descending order.
5. **Check for second highest salary**: If the length of `sorted_salaries` is less than 2, it returns `None`, because there is no second highest salary available.
6. **Return the second highest**: Otherwise, it returns the second item in the sorted list.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python code simulates the logic we used in the SQL query and allows us to find the second highest salary from a given list of employee records in a format that would work similarly to how one would query a database. You can easily modify the `employees` list to test with different data.

Once you provide the necessary details, I would be happy to help you write the code and explain the solution in a format suitable for LeetCode!

# 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like your request was cut off, as it only mentions "SQL Schema" without providing any details on the problem itself. However, based on typical LeetCode problems that involve SQL, I can guide you through a generic example of a problem involving SQL queries. 

Let’s assume you're looking for a problem related to a table of employees and their salaries, where you might need to find the top earners or perhaps the average salary. Here, I'll provide a common SQL challenge and demonstrate how it can be solved. 

### Problem Description

**Employee Table:**

| EmpId | Name    | Salary |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1     | John    | 3000   |
| 2     | Jane    | 4000   |
| 3     | Joe     | 2500   |
| 4     | Jenny   | 6000   |
| 5     | James   | 4500   |

**Task:** Write a SQL query to find the name of the employee with the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, return `null`.

### SQL Query to Solve the Problem

Here is the SQL code that you can use to solve this problem:


```sql
SELECT 
    Name 
FROM 
    Employee 
ORDER BY 
    Salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

```

### Explanation

1. **ORDER BY Salary DESC**: This part of the query sorts the records in descending order based on the Salary column. The highest salary will be first, followed by the second highest, and so on.

2. **LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1**: The `LIMIT 1` clause specifies that we want to retrieve only one record, which is the second highest after the offset. The `OFFSET 1` clause tells the query to skip the first row (which has the highest salary).

3. The result will be the name of the employee who has the second highest salary. If there is only one employee or all employees have the same salary, this will return `NULL`.

### Code to Upload to LeetCode

If you were to create a new problem on LeetCode, you would define it like this:


```plaintext
# Problem
You are given a table called `Employee` with the following schema:

+------------+---------+
| Column Name| Type    |
+------------+---------+
| EmpId      | int     |
| Name       | varchar  |
| Salary     | int     |
+------------+---------+
EmpId is the primary key for this table. Each record contains the name and salary of an employee.

Write an SQL query to get the name of the employee with the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, return 'null'.

# Example

Input:
+--------+-------+--------+
| EmpId  | Name  | Salary |
+--------+-------+--------+
| 1      | John  | 3000   |
| 2      | Jane  | 4000   |
| 3      | Joe   | 2500   |
| 4      | Jenny | 6000   |
| 5      | James | 4500   |
+--------+-------+--------+

Output:
+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| James |
+-------+


```

# 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like your request is incomplete, as I cannot see the SQL schema or the problem statement to generate a solution. However, I can explain how to structure a LeetCode solution in Python once the complete problem statement is provided. Below is a general format you can follow, along with an example problem (like "Two Sum") for context.

### Structure of a LeetCode Solution in Python

1. **Function Signature**: The function name and its parameters as per the problem statement.
2. **Logic**: Implement the necessary logic to solve the problem.
3. **Return Statement**: Return the required output in a format specified by the problem statement.

### Example Problem: "Two Sum"

#### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

#### SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Numbers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    value INT
);

```

#### Python Solution

Here is a Python solution formatted for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        """
        This function finds two indices in the list `nums` such that their corresponding values add up to `target`.
        
        :param nums: List[int] - A list of integers.
        :param target: int - The target sum to find.
        :return: List[int] - A list containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
        """
        # Create a hashmap to store the difference and index
        hashmap = {}
        
        # Iterate through the array
        for index, number in enumerate(nums):
            # Calculate the difference
            difference = target - number
            
            # Check if the difference exists in the hashmap
            if difference in hashmap:
                # Return indices if found
                return [hashmap[difference], index]
            
            # Store the number with its index in the hashmap
            hashmap[number] = index
        
        # In case there's no solution; usually, there's an assumption there's always one
        return []

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**: The `Solution` class is defined as per LeetCode's requirement.
2. **Function Signature**: `twoSum` takes two parameters: 
   - `nums`: A list of integers.
   - `target`: An integer for the target sum.
3. **Using a HashMap**: 
   - A hashmap (dictionary) is used to store the numbers and their respective indices as we iterate through the list. This allows for O(1) average-time complexity for lookups.
4. **Loop Through the List**: 
   - For each number, calculate the `difference` needed to meet the `target`.
   - If this `difference` is found in the hashmap, the corresponding index and the current index are returned as a list.
5. **Return Statement**: If no pair is found (though this is typically not the case in many LeetCode problems), return an empty list.

### Next Steps
If you provide the specific SQL schema and problem statement you'd like to see a solution for, I can tailor the code example accordingly.

# 603. Consecutive Available Seats

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems you mentioned a SQL schema but didn't provide the specific problem details or the SQL schema itself. However, I can help you with a common structure for solving a problem in Python following the LeetCode solution format. Additionally, I can also provide a detailed explanation once the problem is specified.

Let’s assume a generic problem statement where we need to work with some SQL schema, and we'll format the Python solution accordingly. If you provide me with a specific problem statement and SQL schema, I can tailor the answer directly to that.

Here's a hypothetical example of how a LeetCode solution could look like:

### Problem Statement
Given a table `Employees` with the following schema:


```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| department  | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

```

Write a SQL query to find the name and salary of all employees who earn more than 50000.

### MySQL Solution

You can execute this query in a MySQL environment:


```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

```

### Python Solution

This is a scenario where we can implement a solution using Python that mimics the SQL behavior. Since LeetCode typically asks for a function, we will define a function that processes a hypothetical list of employee dictionaries.



```python
from typing import List, Dict

class Solution:
    def high_salary_employees(self, employees: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
        """
        This function checks for employees with a salary greater than 50000.
        
        Args:
            employees: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents
                       an employee with 'name' and 'salary' keys.

        Returns:
            List[Dict[str, int]]: A list of dictionaries containing the name and salary
                                   of employees that earn more than 50000.
        """
        high_earners = []
        for employee in employees:
            if employee['salary'] > 50000:
                high_earners.append({'name': employee['name'], 'salary': employee['salary']})
        return high_earners

```

### Explanation

1. **Input and Output**: The function `high_salary_employees` takes a list of dictionaries as input where each dictionary represents an employee. It returns a list of dictionaries that contains names and salaries of employees with a salary greater than 50000.

2. **Looping through Employees**: The function iterates through each employee in the provided list. It checks if the salary of the employee exceeds 50000.

3. **Storing Results**: If an employee's salary is greater than 50000, it constructs a new dictionary containing their name and salary, which is then appended to a result list.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns the list of employees who meet the salary criteria.

### Note

- This function exemplifies how you can convert SQL-like logic into Python code. In actual practice, if you were working with a SQL database, you would use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or a database connection to execute SQL queries directly.

If you can provide the exact problem statement and input schema, I will gladly provide you with a more precise solution!

# 607. Sales Person

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It appears that you've mentioned a problem related to SQL Schema but haven’t provided a specific problem statement. Since you mentioned a desire to solve a problem in Python, I can help you with a generic example that deals with SQL and Python, as well as give you a structure that aligns with expected format on platforms like LeetCode.

For instance, let's take a common problem related to SQL and provide a solution using Python. A typical problem might ask you to manipulate data from a database. Please note that LeetCode primarily focuses on algorithm problems that are typically solved with data structures and algorithms, but they also provide a section for database-related questions that use SQL.

### Example Problem: Top Earning Employees

**SQL Schema**

You have a table called `Employees` with the following structure:


```
Employees
------------
| id  | name  | salary |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 1   | John  | 1000   |
| 2   | Jane  | 1500   |
| 3   | Joe   | 1200   |
| 4   | Mary  | 2000   |

```

**Problem Statement**
Write a SQL query to find the names of the top 3 employees with the highest salaries. Return the result in ascending order of salaries.

The expected output would be:


```
| name |
|------|
| John |
| Joe  |
| Jane |

```

### SQL Solution

Here's the SQL solution to the problem, which can be executed directly in a database environment, such as LeetCode’s platform for SQL queries.


```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;

```

### Python Solution ( Using SQLite as an example )

If your requirement is to also interact with the SQL schema from Python, here's how you can do this, using SQLite as an example:



```python
import sqlite3

def top_earning_employees():
    # Connect to the in-memory database
    connection = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Create the Employees table
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE Employees (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT,
            salary INTEGER
        )
    ''')
    
    # Insert sample data
    cursor.executemany('''
        INSERT INTO Employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    ''', [
        (1, 'John', 1000),
        (2, 'Jane', 1500),
        (3, 'Joe', 1200),
        (4, 'Mary', 2000)
    ])
    
    # Query to find the top 3 earning employees
    cursor.execute('''
        SELECT name
        FROM Employees
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 3
    ''')
    
    # Fetch results
    top_employees = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Close the database connection
    connection.close()
    
    # Return names
    return [employee[0] for employee in top_employees]

# Run the function and print the result
print(top_earning_employees())

```

### Explanation

1. **Database Connection**: We connect to an in-memory SQLite database. This does not create any file; it only exists within the application's memory.

2. **Table Creation**: We create the `Employees` table, simulating the SQL schema provided.

3. **Data Insertion**: We insert example data into the table to illustrate how our query works.

4. **Query Execution**: We execute the SQL query that selects the top 3 employees based on their salary, ordering results in descending order.

5. **Fetching Results**: We retrieve the results and extract the names from the fetched data.

6. **Return Result**: We return the names as a list.

In a LeetCode-like environment for a different problem that involves Python programming without SQL, you'll often see a similar problem structure involving defining a function, processing inputs, and returning outputs.

If you provide me with a specific problem statement, I would be glad to write a tailored SQL or Python solution for you!

# 608. Tree Node

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that you're asking for help with a coding problem that is usually found on platforms like LeetCode. However, you mentioned "SQL Schema" which implies the problem may pertain to SQL rather than Python coding. If you are looking for a specific Python solution to an SQL-related problem or something else, please provide more details about the problem statement or the SQL requirements.

If you meant to describe a problem related to databases, for example, "Find all users who made a transaction over $100", please clarify that. If you meant a different problem, please specify it so that I can assist you properly.

Here’s how to structure a solution on LeetCode for a common problem as an example:

### Problem Statement Example (Hypothetical)
You are given a list of integers. Write a Python function to find the intersection of two lists.

### SQL Schema
(No SQL Schema needed for this problem since it is purely algorithm-based.)

### Function Signature


```python
def intersection(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:

```

### Explanation of the Code
Below is a Python solution to find the intersection of two lists, along with a detailed explanation of each step:



```python
from typing import List

def intersection(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Step 1: Convert the first list to a set to remove duplicates
    set1 = set(nums1)
    
    # Step 2: Use a set comprehension to find the intersection with the second list
    # This will iterate over nums2 and include only the elements that are also in set1
    result = {num for num in nums2 if num in set1}
    
    # Step 3: Convert the result set back to a list and return it
    return list(result)

```

### Detailed Explanation
1. **Import Statements**: We first import the `List` type from the `typing` module, which allows us to specify the input and output types of our function.

2. **Function Definition**: We define the function `intersection` that takes two lists of integers, `nums1` and `nums2`, and returns a list of integers.

3. **Convert List to Set**: We convert `nums1` into a set called `set1`. This is done to eliminate any duplicate values and to allow for faster lookup times compared to a list.

4. **Set Comprehension**: We use a set comprehension to create a new set `result` that contains only values from `nums2` that are also in `set1`. This checks each number in `nums2` against `set1` for membership.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we convert the resulting set back into a list and return it.

### Time Complexity
The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in `nums1` and m is the number of elements in `nums2`. This is because we iterate through each list once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) for storing the numbers in `set1` and O(min(n, m)) for the result, leading to a total space complexity of O(n).

### Example Usage
In the LeetCode environment, you typically don't provide the example usage section, as the platform will test the function directly with its own test cases. However, in a normal Python script, you might call the function like this:



```python
print(intersection([1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2]))  # Output: [2]

```

Please provide the specific problem statement if you would like a more tailored response!

# 610. Triangle Judgement

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you're requesting a solution to a LeetCode problem, but you haven't provided a specific problem statement. Typically, SQL schema problems involve selecting data from a simulated database. For now, I will create a common type of SQL problem based on a hypothetical question. 

Below, I'll provide an example of how you could format a Python code solution following the LeetCode style, along with explanations of the code:

### Sample Problem Statement:

**Problem: Retrieve Top N Employees**

You are given a database with the following schema:


```sql
Employees (id INT, name VARCHAR(255), salary INT)

```

Write a SQL query to find the top `N` highest salaries from the `Employees` table. Your query should return the top `N` salaries in descending order. If there are ties, all ties should be returned.

**Example Input:**

```
Employees Table:
+----+-------+--------+
| id | name  | salary |
+----+-------+--------+
| 1  | John  | 1000   |
| 2  | Jane  | 1500   |
| 3  | Dave  | 1500   |
| 4  | Mike  | 1200   |
+----+-------+--------+

```

**Input**: N = 2

**Example Output:**

```
+--------+
| salary |
+--------+
| 1500   |
| 1500   |
+--------+

```

### SQL Query:
To solve this problem, we will write a SQL query that retrieves the top N salaries but includes duplicate salaries.


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT N;

```

### Python Code Solution for LeetCode:

Although typical LeetCode solutions are provided in languages like Python, SQL in this case is best expressed in its native form. However, I'll provide a Python solution that demonstrates how to implement the functionality of querying a database to get the top N salaries as specified.

Assuming you might be using an SQL-yielding library like SQLite in actual code:



```python
import sqlite3

def get_top_n_salaries(N):
    # Connect to the SQLite database (replace with your database connection)
    conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')  # Using in-memory for demonstration
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create Employees table
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE Employees (
            id INT,
            name TEXT,
            salary INT
        )
    ''')

    # Sample data insertion, in a real scenario this would be your existing data.
    cursor.executemany('''
        INSERT INTO Employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    ''', [(1, 'John', 1000), 
           (2, 'Jane', 1500), 
           (3, 'Dave', 1500), 
           (4, 'Mike', 1200)])

    # SQL query to get top N salaries
    query = f'''
        SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM Employees
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT {N}
    '''

    # Execute the query and fetch results
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Closing the connection
    conn.close()
    
    # Return the list of salaries
    return [row[0] for row in results]

# Example usage:
print(get_top_n_salaries(2))  # Output: [1500, 1000]

```

### Explanation:
1. **Database Connection**: The script connects to an SQLite database. You'd replace this with your actual database connection in a real scenario.

2. **Table Creation**: A mock `Employees` table is created which matches the schema mentioned in the problem.

3. **Data Insertion**: Sample employee records are inserted for testing purposes.

4. **Dynamic SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves distinct salaries, orders them in descending order, and limits the output to the top N.

5. **Execution**: The query is executed, and results are fetched.

6. **Return Format**: The results are formatted into a list and returned.

### How to Use:
You can copy the Python function `get_top_n_salaries` to your local machine or your script for testing purposes. Adjust the database connection string, table schema, or values as necessary based on your use case.

This solution is only an illustrative example based on assumptions as the specific problem wasn't provided. Please specify the exact SQL schema problem if you'd like a more tailored solution.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like you might be referring to a problem commonly found in SQL challenges on platforms like LeetCode that typically involve queries on a database schema. However, since you didn't specify the exact problem or SQL schema, I’ll provide a general template for a LeetCode solution that processes data using SQL and translate it into a Python code solution that represents an appropriate algorithmic challenge. If you provide more details about a specific problem, I can provide a tailored solution.

For this example, let’s simulate a common SQL problem: finding the second highest salary from a employee table. Here's how you could structure it according to the LeetCode format, including sample data, the problem description, and a solution.

### Problem Statement

Given a table `Employee`:

| Column    | Type    |
|-----------|---------|
| id        | int     |
| name      | varchar |
| salary    | int     |

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should return `null`.

### SQL Schema


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    salary INT NOT NULL
);

```

### Example Input

For example, if the table is:

| id | name | salary |
|----|------|--------|
| 1  | Joe  | 70000  |
| 2  | Jim  | 90000  |
| 3  | Henry| 80000  |

The output should be `80000`, which is the second highest salary.

### Example SQL Solution


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employee 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

```

### Python Solution

Since you requested a Python code solution following the LeetCode format but with an equivalent challenge, we can approach it via algorithms, such as finding the second largest element in a list of salaries. Below is a Python solution using a list to replicate the example.

Here's how to implement it:



```python
class Solution:
    def secondHighestSalary(self, salaries: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:
        # Using a set to find distinct salaries
        distinct_salaries = list(set(salaries))
        if len(distinct_salaries) < 2:
            return None  # If there's no second highest, return None
        # Sort distinct salaries in descending order
        distinct_salaries.sort(reverse=True)
        return distinct_salaries[1]  # Return the second highest salary

# Example Usage
salaries = [70000, 90000, 80000, 80000]
solution = Solution()
print(solution.secondHighestSalary(salaries))  # Output: 80000

```

### Explanation of the Python Code

1. **Input**: The function `secondHighestSalary` takes a list of integers representing salaries.
2. **Finding Distinct Salaries**: We convert the list of salaries into a set to remove duplicates, then convert it back to a list.
3. **Checking the Length**: If there are less than 2 distinct salaries, we return `None` since there’s no second highest salary.
4. **Sorting**: We sort the list of distinct salaries in descending order.
5. **Returning the Result**: We return the salary at index 1, which is the second highest.

### Conclusion
The provided code will accurately find the second highest salary from a list of salaries using a Python list and handles edge cases (like fewer than two distinct salaries) gracefully. This structure follows the conventions of LeetCode submission and can be directly pasted into their platform as a solution. If you have a specific SQL query or schema to work with, please provide it, and I can adapt the explanation and the code accordingly.

# 613. Shortest Distance in a Line

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that you started to mention a problem but did not finish your request concerning the SQL Schema or the specific problem you intended to solve. However, I can certainly guide you through the general process of solving a LeetCode problem, particularly in the context of SQL problems or any other programming challenge.

For SQL problems, usually, you'll only need to write a SQL query to solve the problem, rather than Python code. Below, I'll proceed with an example SQL problem format and provide a brief explanation. If you meant a Python problem (like those in algorithms), please provide more details, and I’ll adjust accordingly.

### Example SQL Problem

**Problem:** Finding the ID of the most recent booking from a bookings table.

#### SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customerName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    bookingDate DATE NOT NULL
);

```

### SQL Query Solution
To find the most recent booking, you can use the following SQL query:


```sql
SELECT id 
FROM Bookings 
ORDER BY bookingDate DESC 
LIMIT 1;

```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT id:** This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the `id` of the booking.
2. **FROM Bookings:** Here, we are pointing to the `Bookings` table from which we want to get our data.
3. **ORDER BY bookingDate DESC:** This orders the results by the `bookingDate` in descending order, meaning the most recent date will be first.
4. **LIMIT 1:** Finally, we limit our results to just one entry, which gives us the ID of the most recent booking.

### How to Submit on LeetCode
1. Navigate to the SQL problem page on LeetCode.
2. Enter the query text provided in the SQL query solution.
3. Click on the "Run Code" button to test your solution.
4. If it passes all test cases, click "Submit".

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that you've mentioned an SQL schema-related problem without providing specific details about the task at hand. To help you better, I'll assume you're referring to a typical problem found in algorithms involving database queries that can be addressed with Python as outlined in the LeetCode format.

Since you need to see how SQL schema translates into a programming problem, I will create a common type of LeetCode question that might relate to SQL queries. Let's consider a problem where we need to find employees and their respective departments from a database schema.

**Problem Statement**

Imagine we have the following SQL tables:


```sql
Employees:
+----+----------+------------+
| Id | Name     | Department |
+----+----------+------------+
| 1  | John     | Sales      |
| 2  | Jane     | HR         |
| 3  | Bob      | Engineering |
| 4  | Alice    | Sales      |
| 5  | Eric     | HR         |
+----+----------+------------+

Departments:
+----+-------------+
| Id | Department  |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | Sales       |
| 2  | HR          |
| 3  | Engineering  |
| 4  | Marketing   |
+----+-------------+

```

### Problem
Write a function that, given a list of employee records and a list of department records, returns a list of employees along with their departments.

### Input
- A list of tuples where each tuple contains (Id, Name, Department)
- A second list of tuples where each tuple contains (Id, Department)

### Output
- A list of tuples containing (Employee Name, Department Name)

### Constraints
- Each department appears at least once.

### Python Solution
Let's translate this problem into Python code that adheres to the expected format.



```python
def employees_with_departments(employees, departments):
    # Create a dictionary to map department names to department ids
    department_map = {}
    for dep_id, dep_name in departments:
        department_map[dep_name] = dep_id

    result = []
    
    # Iterate over employees and match their department
    for emp_id, emp_name, emp_department in employees:
        if emp_department in department_map:
            result.append((emp_name, emp_department))

    return result

# Example usage:
employees_list = [(1, "John", "Sales"), (2, "Jane", "HR"),
                  (3, "Bob", "Engineering"), (4, "Alice", "Sales"), (5, "Eric", "HR")]
departments_list = [(1, "Sales"), (2, "HR"), (3, "Engineering"), (4, "Marketing")]

print(employees_with_departments(employees_list, departments_list))

```

### Explanation
1. **Input Representation**: We represent the employees and departments as lists of tuples. Each tuple represents a record.
  
2. **Mapping Departments**: We use a dictionary to create a mapping from department names to their corresponding IDs for quick lookup.

3. **Finding Matches**: We iterate through each employee's record, checking if their department exists in our department mapping. If it does, we append the employee's name and department name to our result list.

4. **Return**: Finally, we return the collected results.

### Conclusion
This approach efficiently combines two lists based on department matching, ensuring that the return format meets the problem’s requirements while being straightforward and easy to understand. Copy and paste this code into the appropriate LeetCode environment to run and test it! 

If you have a specific SQL schema or problem in mind, please provide it so I can tailor the solution accordingly.

# 615. Average Salary: Departments VS Company

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! It appears that you want to write a Python solution for a problem on LeetCode, but I noticed that you didn’t specify the ID or name of the problem you want to solve. For Python solutions on LeetCode, the general structure involves defining a class and implementing a method that contains the solution to the problem.

Since you mentioned an SQL schema, I will assume you want to work with a problem related to SQL, such as querying results from a database. However, without a specific problem, I'll create an example problem that you might find on LeetCode:

### Problem Statement Example: "Employees Earning More than their Managers"

You are given two tables: `Employee` and `Manager`.


```plaintext
Employee:
+----+-------+--------+
| Id | Name  | Salary |
+----+-------+--------+
| 1  | John  | 1000   |
| 2  | Doe   | 1500   |
| 3  | Jane  | 2000   |
+----+-------+--------+

Manager:
+-------+----------+
| EmpId | MgrId    |
+-------+----------+
| 1     | 2        |
| 2     | 3        |
| 3     | null     |
+-------+----------+

```

Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers. The query should return the employee's name and the name of their manager.

### SQL Query


```sql
SELECT e.Name AS EmployeeName, m.Name AS ManagerName
FROM Employee e
JOIN Manager r ON e.Id = r.EmpId
JOIN Employee m ON r.MgrId = m.Id
WHERE e.Salary > m.Salary;

```

Now let's convert this problem into a Python function as if it were a problem from LeetCode.

### Python Solution

Here’s how you would set up the solution in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def getEmployeesWithHigherSalary(self, employees, managers):
        # Create a mapping from manager Id to their Salary
        manager_salary = {}
        
        for emp in employees:
            emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary = emp
            manager_salary[emp_id] = emp_salary

        result = []
        
        for emp in managers:
            emp_id, mgr_id = emp
            
            # Get employee's salary
            employee_info = next((e for e in employees if e[0] == emp_id), None)
            if not employee_info:
                continue
            
            emp_name, emp_salary = employee_info[1], employee_info[2]
            
            # If manager exists
            if mgr_id is not None:
                # Check if manager exists in employees list
                manager_info = next((e for e in employees if e[0] == mgr_id), None)
                if manager_info:
                    mgr_name, mgr_salary = manager_info[1], manager_info[2]
                    if emp_salary > mgr_salary:
                        result.append((emp_name, mgr_name))
        
        return result

# Example usage
employees = [
    (1, "John", 1000),
    (2, "Doe", 1500),
    (3, "Jane", 2000)
]

managers = [
    (1, 2), 
    (2, 3), 
    (3, None)
]

sol = Solution()
output = sol.getEmployeesWithHigherSalary(employees, managers)
print(output)  # Output will be the list of employees who earn more than their managers

```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Structures**: We are using lists of tuples to represent the employees and their managers. Each tuple has the format `(Id, Name, Salary)` for employees and `(EmpId, MgrId)` for managers.
  
2. **Mapping Salaries**: We create a dictionary to map employee IDs to their salaries to easily access salary data by employee ID.

3. **Finding Employees with Higher Salaries**: We iterate through the managers. For each manager, we find the associated employee and check if that employee earns more than their manager. If they do, we add the pair of names to our result list.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list showing which employees earn more than their managers.

This example directly reflects the SQL problem and the approach to solve it programmatically in Python, formatted for a typical LeetCode problem setup. Please let me know if you had a different problem in mind!

# 618. Students Report By Geography

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! While your prompt did not specify a particular SQL problem or schema, I assume you're looking for a way to convert common SQL problems into Python solutions, typically used in coding interviews like those on LeetCode.

I’ll provide a generic example that mimics a SQL-like problem: counting distinct values in a table and returning them. I will also include the structure that a solution on LeetCode typically follows, with a function definition, input parameters, and expected outputs.

### Problem Example
Let's consider a problem where we want to count the distinct employee IDs from an `Employees` table. The SQL query might look something like this:


```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS uniqueEmployees FROM Employees;

```

### Python Solution
Below is a Python function that simulates retrieving data from an `Employees` table and counts the unique employee IDs. We will assume the input will be a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a record in the `Employees` table.



```python
class Solution:
    def countUniqueEmployees(self, employees: List[Dict[str,int]]) -> int:
        """
        Given a list of employee dictionaries, count the number of unique employee IDs.

        Params:
        employees (List[Dict[str,int]]): List containing dictionaries of employee records.

        Returns:
        int: The number of unique employee IDs.
        """

        # Using a set to store unique employee IDs
        unique_employees = set()

        # Loop through each employee record in the provided list
        for employee in employees:
            # Assuming each employee dictionary has an 'employee_id' key
            unique_employees.add(employee['employee_id'])
        
        # The number of unique employee IDs is the size of the set
        return len(unique_employees)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    employees = [
        {'employee_id': 1},
        {'employee_id': 2},
        {'employee_id': 1},
        {'employee_id': 3}
    ]
    print(solution.countUniqueEmployees(employees))  # Output: 3

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Class Definition**: We define a class named `Solution` which is in line with how LeetCode structures its problems.

2. **Function Definition**: Inside the class, we define the function `countUniqueEmployees` which takes a list of dictionaries as input.

3. **Set for Uniqueness**: 
   - We initialize an empty set named `unique_employees`. A set is used here because it inherently only keeps unique items, and adding a duplicate will have no effect.

4. **Loop through Employees**: 
   - We loop through each dictionary in the `employees` list. For each record, we add the `employee_id` to our set. 

5. **Return Unique Count**: 
   - Finally, we return the size of the set using the built-in `len()` function, which gives us the count of unique employee IDs.

6. **Example Usage**: 
   - The example usage shows how to create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the function with a sample list of employee records.

### Running the Code
To test this code directly on LeetCode or any similar platform, you'd encapsulate the core logic in the `countUniqueEmployees` method defined above, ensuring your input matches the expected format per the problem description.

Make sure you customize the input structure and logic based on the actual problem requirements when implementing on LeetCode.

# 619. Biggest Single Number

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It appears that your request was cut off. Since I don't have the details of the SQL schema or the specific problem you want to solve, I will illustrate how to write a Python solution in the format commonly used for LeetCode problems.

Let's assume a hypothetical problem related to a SQL schema, such as retrieving the first name and last name of all employees in a company who have a salary greater than a certain threshold. To frame this, I'll create a sample problem statement for context.

### Problem Statement:

Given a SQL table named `Employees`, the schema of the table is as follows:


```
Employees (EmployeeId INT, FirstName VARCHAR, LastName VARCHAR, Salary INT)

```

Write a SQL query to return the `FirstName` and `LastName` of all employees who have a `Salary` greater than $50,000.

### SQL Query:

To solve this problem, we can write the following SQL query:


```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;

```

### Python Code Solution:

For a LeetCode problem, one might be asked to solve this using a function, especially if we are working with data in a more programmatic way (not SQL). Here’s how you could use Python to achieve something similar:



```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, Salary):
        self.EmployeeId = EmployeeId
        self.FirstName = FirstName
        self.LastName = LastName
        self.Salary = Salary

def filter_high_salary_employees(employees):
    """
    This function filters employees based on their salary.
    
    :param employees: List[Employee] - A list of Employee objects
    :return: List[Tuple[str, str]] - A list of tuples containing FirstName and LastName
    """
    high_salary_employees = [
        (emp.FirstName, emp.LastName)
        for emp in employees
        if emp.Salary > 50000
    ]
    
    return high_salary_employees

# Sample Input
employees = [
    Employee(1, "John", "Doe", 60000),
    Employee(2, "Jane", "Smith", 45000),
    Employee(3, "Jim", "Brown", 70000),
]

# Function Call
result = filter_high_salary_employees(employees)

# Displaying the result
print(result)  # Output: [('John', 'Doe'), ('Jim', 'Brown')]

```

### Explanation:

1. **Class Definition**: We begin by defining a class `Employee` to represent our data structure. Each `Employee` object has an ID, first name, last name, and salary.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `filter_high_salary_employees` takes a list of `Employee` objects and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the first name and last name of employees whose salary exceeds $50,000.

3. **List Comprehension**: We utilize a list comprehension to iterate through each employee. We check if the `Salary` of each employee is greater than $50,000, and if true, we append a tuple of (FirstName, LastName) to the result list.

4. **Sample Input**: We create a sample list of employees to demonstrate the function.

5. **Function Call**: Finally, we call our function and print the result for verification.

This Python format allows you to adapt it to LeetCode problems by wrapping the logic into an appropriate function and calling it with sample inputs. Ensure that you adjust the class and function according to the actual problem statement provided in your LeetCode question. If you provide specific details or another problem, I can tailor the solution accordingly!

# 620. Not Boring Movies

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! Below is the explanation of a generic approach to solving a problem based on an SQL schema, along with a sample SQL query formatted for a platform like LeetCode. 

Let's assume the problem requires us to fetch unique values or perform aggregate operations based on a given SQL schema.

### Problem Example
Suppose you are given a SQL schema for a table named `Employees` with the following structure:

- `id`: An integer representing the employee ID (Primary Key).
- `name`: A string representing the name of the employee.
- `salary`: A float representing the salary of the employee.
- `department_id`: An integer representing the ID of the department to which the employee belongs.

### Goal
Our goal will be to write a SQL query that retrieves the names of employees who earn more than the average salary of their respective department.

### SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT NOT NULL
);

```

### SQL Query
Here’s how you can solve the problem using SQL:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT e.name
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(sub.salary)
    FROM Employees sub
    WHERE sub.department_id = e.department_id
)

```

### Explanation
1. **Main Query**: The main query starts with selecting the distinct names (`SELECT DISTINCT e.name`) from the `Employees` table (aliased as `e`).
  
2. **Subquery**: The subquery computes the average salary of employees within the same department. It uses `AVG(sub.salary)` to calculate this from a subset (`sub`) of the `Employees` table, filtered by the department ID that matches the current employee's department (`WHERE sub.department_id = e.department_id`).
  
3. **Comparison Condition**: In the `WHERE` clause of the main query, we check if the salary of each employee (`e.salary`) is greater than the average salary calculated from the subquery.

### Running the Code
To run this query on LeetCode or a similar environment:
- Make sure you have access to the given SQL schema.
- Use the SQL editor provided as part of the problem statement.
- Paste the query into the editor and execute it against the database.

### Final Code Submission
Your final submission on LeetCode would simply be the SQL query provided above.

This format can be used directly in the LeetCode website, and you can adapt the SQL schema and problem statement to suit the provided problem in your case. If you have a specific SQL schema or problem statement, please provide it for tailored assistance!

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! Although you haven't provided the specific details of the SQL Schema or the problem statement, I can guide you through how to structure a Python solution for a typical LeetCode problem. 

Let's assume a common SQL-related LeetCode problem, such as finding the second highest salary from a table named `Employee`. Below, I’ll outline how to construct the problem in the LeetCode format and provide the Python solution.

### Problem Description

Given a table called `Employee` that contains the following columns:

- `id` int: the primary key for the employee.
- `name` varchar(255): the name of the employee.
- `salary` int: the salary of the employee.

Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should return `null`.

### SQL Schema


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary INT
);

```

### SQL Query (for understanding the expected solution)


```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

### Python Code Conversion

For the sake of percentage, let's assume we want to implement the main logic in Python, similar to how we would write a SQL query through ORM or in a data processing framework, while focusing on algorithms. Here's how we can structure the implementation.



```python
class Solution:
    def secondHighestSalary(self, salaries):
        # Using a set to avoid duplicates
        unique_salaries = set(salaries)
        
        # If we need a second highest, it means we need at least 2 unique salaries
        if len(unique_salaries) < 2:
            return None
            
        # Sorting the unique salaries
        sorted_salaries = sorted(unique_salaries, reverse=True)
        
        # Returning the second highest
        return sorted_salaries[1]  # The second item in the sorted list

# Example usage
s = Solution()
print(s.secondHighestSalary([100, 200, 300]))  # Output: 200
print(s.secondHighestSalary([100, 100, 100]))  # Output: None

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Function Definition**: We define a method `secondHighestSalary` which takes a list of salaries as input.
- **Using a Set**: We convert the list of salaries to a set to automatically handle duplicate salaries.
- **Checking Length**: If the length of the set is less than 2, it means there aren’t enough unique salaries to determine the second highest, so we return `None`.
- **Sorting the Set**: We convert the set back to a sorted list in descending order.
- **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the second item from the sorted list which corresponds to the second highest salary.

### Note for Execution

# 627. Swap Salary

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like your request was cut off before you finished describing the problem related to SQL schema. However, I can provide you with a general structure of how to solve problems on LeetCode, particularly if we were looking at a problem that involves SQL or data retrieval.

The common structure for a solution in LeetCode for SQL problems has two parts:

1. **Problem Statement:** A short description of the SQL problem, what tables are involved, and what the expected output should be.
2. **SQL Query:** The actual SQL code that solves the problem.

**Example Problem:**
Let's say we have a problem that requires us to find the names of employees who have a salary greater than 50000 from an `Employee` table.

### SQL Schema


```plaintext
Employee
+----+--------+----------+
| Id | Name   | Salary   |
+----+--------+----------+
| 1  | John   | 60000    |
| 2  | Jane   | 45000    |
| 3  | Mark   | 70000    |
| 4  | Lucy   | 35000    |
+----+--------+----------+

```

### Query Requirement

We need to retrieve the names of employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

### SQL Query

Given the schema and the requirement, the SQL query will be as follows:


```sql
SELECT Name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary > 50000;

```

### Explanation of the SQL Code:
1. **SELECT Name:** This part of the SQL query specifies that we want to retrieve the "Name" column from the table.
  
2. **FROM Employee:** This indicates the table we're querying, which in this case is the `Employee` table.
  
3. **WHERE Salary > 50000:** This clause filters the results to only include rows where the "Salary" column is greater than 50,000.

### Final LeetCode Solution Format
Here’s how the problem can be summarized in a way that could be run directly on LeetCode:


```sql
-- Problem Statement: Retrieve the names of employees 
-- whose salary is greater than 50,000.

SELECT Name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary > 50000;

```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure your SQL environment (like MySQL or SQLite) is compatible with the functions you are using.
- Always test your query on the respective platform's provided sample data to validate correctness.
- If the problem generates multiple results, the order of results could affect grading, so always check if there are any specific ordering requirements (like `ORDER BY` clause).

# 796. Rotate String

### Problem Description 
We are given two strings, `A` and `B`.

A shift on `A` consists of taking string `A` and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if `A = 'abcde'`, then it will be `'bcdea'` after one shift on `A`. Return `True` if and only if `A` can become `B` after some number of shifts on `A`.


Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false
Note:
`A` and `B` will have length at most `100`.

### Solution 
 To determine if one string `A` can be transformed into another string `B` via a series of shifts, we can leverage an interesting property of strings. By concatenating string `A` with itself, we create a new string that contains all possible shifts of `A`. For instance, if we have `A = "abcde"`, then concatenating `A` with itself produces `"abcdeabcde"`, which includes all possible rotations of `A`: `"abcde"`, `"bcdea"`, `"cdeab"`, `"deabc"`, and `"eabcd"`.

With this insight, the problem simplifies to checking if `B` is a substring of the concatenated string `A + A`. 

### Implementation Steps
1. Check if the lengths of `A` and `B` are equal. If they're not, return `False` immediately, since rotations must have the same length.
2. Create a new string by concatenating `A` with itself.
3. Check if `B` is a substring of the concatenated string.
4. Return the result based on the substring check.

### Python Code Solution

Here’s the complete code implemented in a format that can be directly run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def rotateString(self, A: str, B: str) -> bool:
        # Check if lengths are equal
        if len(A) != len(B):
            return False
        
        # Concatenate A with itself to check for rotations
        double_A = A + A
        
        # Check if B is a substring of double_A
        return B in double_A

```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define a class named `Solution` that contains a method `rotateString`.
- The method accepts two parameters, `A` and `B`, both of which are strings.
- The first conditional check ensures that the lengths of `A` and `B` are equal. If not, the function will return `False`, as it's impossible to match strings of different lengths through rotation.
- We create a new string `double_A` by concatenating `A` with itself, which contains all possible shifts of `A`.
- Finally, we check if `B` is present in `double_A` using the `in` operator, which returns `True` if `B` can be found as a substring in `double_A`, indicating that `A` can be transformed into `B` by rotating.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of string A. The substring search in Python on average runs in linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the concatenated string `double_A`.

This solution efficiently determines if a string can be transformed into another string through shifts, adhering to the constraints provided by the problem.

# 798. Smallest Rotation with Highest Score

### Problem Description 
 Given an array `A`, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer `K` so that the array becomes `A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1]`.  Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth 1 point. 
For example, if we have `[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]`, and we rotate by `K = 2`, it becomes `[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]`.  This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest score we could receive.  If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index K.


Example 1:
Input: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation:  
Scores for each K are listed below: 
K = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
K = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
K = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
K = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
K = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3
So we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.


Example 2:
Input: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation:  A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.

So we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.

Note:
`A` will have length at most `20000`.

`A[i]` will be in the range `[0, A.length]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the optimal rotation index \( K \) for a given array \( A \) that yields the highest score, we can use a direct approach combined with efficient calculation of scores. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding Rotation**: Rotating the array by \( K \) means the element at index \( i \) will move to the index \( (i + K) \mod n \), where \( n \) is the length of the array.

2. **Scoring Criterion**: For each index \( i \), if the element at that new index is less than or equal to \( i \), we get one point.

3. **Multiple Rotations**: We need to compute scores for all \( K \) from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) and keep track of the highest score along with the smallest \( K \) that yields that score.

4. **Optimize Computation**: Instead of recalculating scores for every \( K \) from scratch, we can derive the score for \( K \) based on the score from \( K-1 \) with some adjustments.

### Implementation

The main idea is to calculate the score for \( K = 0 \), then use this base score to derive scores for subsequent \( K \) values. Each shift of \( K \) will only affect the score in a predictable pattern.

Here’s the Python code to implement this logic:



```python
def bestRotation(A):
    n = len(A)
    
    # Step 1: Calculate initial score for K = 0
    score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if A[i] <= i:
            score += 1
    
    # Step 2: Use an array to store how the score changes when we rotate
    score_change = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        # If A[i] needs to move to the front, it will become less than or equal to (i + 1)
        # It means it should add or subtract points accordingly.
        # From K = 0, this element will affect K = i + 1 to K = (i + 1 + A[i] - 1) % n
        # So, we should calculate the ranges where A[i] contributes points when shifted to the front
        start = (i - A[i] + 1 + n) % n  # When K is at least start, A[i] will no longer contribute to score
        end = (i + 1) % n
        
        if start <= end:
            score_change[start] += 1
            if end < n:
                score_change[end] -= 1
        else:
            score_change[start] += 1
            score_change[0] += 1
            score_change[end] -= 1
    
    # Step 3: Calculate scores and find the maximum
    max_score = score
    best_k = 0
    
    for k in range(1, n):
        score += score_change[k]  # Apply the precomputed change in score
        if score > max_score:      # Update the best score and corresponding k
            max_score = score
            best_k = k
        elif score == max_score:   # If scores are equal, prefer the smaller k
            best_k = min(best_k, k)

    return best_k

# Sample test cases
print(bestRotation([2, 3, 1, 4, 0]))  # Output: 3
print(bestRotation([1, 3, 0, 2, 4]))  # Output: 0

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: We calculate the initial score for \( K = 0 \).
- **Score Change Calculation**: We maintain an array `score_change` where each entry represents how the score will change when moving to the next rotation \( K \).
- **Dynamic Score Calculation**: For each successive \( K \), we adjust the score based on the score_change array.
- **Finding Maximum Score**: As we iterate through \( K \), we update our maximum score and track the corresponding index \( K \).

This approach allows us to find the optimal rotation with a time complexity of \( O(n) \), which is efficient given the constraint that \( n \) can be as large as 20,000.

# 804. Unique Morse Code Words

### Problem Description 
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: `"a"` maps to `".-"`, `"b"` maps to `"-..."`, `"c"` maps to `"-.-."`, and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + ".-" + "`-...`"). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.


Example:
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."
There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".

Note:
The length of `words` will be at most `100`.

Each `words[i]` will have length in range `[1, 12]`.

`words[i]` will only consist of lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 Certainly! Let's solve the given problem step-by-step. The goal is to count the number of unique Morse code transformations for a list of words.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Morse Code Mapping**: Each letter from 'a' to 'z' has a corresponding Morse code representation. We will create a list of strings with these mappings.

2. **Transforming Words**: For each word, transform it into its Morse code representation by replacing each letter with its corresponding Morse code string and concatenating the results.

3. **Count Unique Transformations**: We will use a set to track unique transformations since sets automatically handle duplicates for us.

### Implementation Steps

1. Define the Morse code list for the letters 'a' to 'z'.
2. Iterate through each word in the input list, transform it to Morse code, and add it to a set.
3. The number of unique transformations will be the size of the set.

### Python Code

Here's the Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueMorseRepresentations(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Morse code mappings for 'a' to 'z'
        morse_code = [
            ".-", "-...", "-.-.", "-..", ".", "..-.", "--.", "....", "..", ".---", "-.-",
            ".-..", "--", "-.", "---", ".--.", "--.-", ".-.", "...", "-", "..-", "...-",
            ".--", "-..-", "-.--", "--.."
        ]
        
        # Set to store unique transformations
        unique_transformations = set()
        
        # Transform each word to Morse code
        for word in words:
            morse_transformation = ''.join(morse_code[ord(c) - ord('a')] for c in word)
            unique_transformations.add(morse_transformation)
        
        # Return the number of unique transformations
        return len(unique_transformations)

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Morse Code List**: `morse_code` is a list where the index corresponds to each letter's position in the alphabet ('a' = 0, 'b' = 1, ..., 'z' = 25).

2. **Using a Set for Unique Transformations**: We initialize a set called `unique_transformations` to store the distinct Morse code strings.

3. **Transformation Process**: For each word, we generate its Morse code transformation:
   - We use a generator expression that iterates over each character in the word.
   - For each character, we compute its Morse code representation using `morse_code[ord(c) - ord('a')]`, where `ord(c)` gets the ASCII value of the character and `ord('a')` is subtracted to find the corresponding index in the Morse code list.
   - We join all these Morse codes into a single string.

4. **Count the Unique Entries**: Finally, we return the size of the `unique_transformations` set, which gives us the number of distinct Morse code transformations.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * W), where N is the number of words and W is the maximum length of a word, since we traverse each word and each of its characters.
- **Space Complexity**: O(U), where U is the number of unique Morse transformations, stored in the set.

This code can be run directly on LeetCode and will provide the correct number of unique Morse code transformations for the provided list of words.

# 806. Number of Lines To Write String

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an array `widths` denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, `widths[0]` is the width of `'a'`, `widths[1]` is the width of `'b'`, and so on.

You are trying to write `s` across several lines, where each line is no longer than `100` pixels. Starting at the beginning of `s`, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed `100` pixels. Then, from where you stopped in `s`, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of `s`.

Return an array `result` of length 2 where:
`result[0]` is the total number of lines.

`result[1]` is the width of the last line in pixels.


Example 1:
Input: widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: [3,60]
Explanation: You can write s as follows:
abcdefghij  // 100 pixels wide
klmnopqrst  // 100 pixels wide
uvwxyz      // 60 pixels wide
There are a total of 3 lines, and the last line is 60 pixels wide.


Example 2:
Input: widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], s = "bbbcccdddaaa"
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: You can write s as follows:
bbbcccdddaa  // 98 pixels wide
a            // 4 pixels wide
There are a total of 2 lines, and the last line is 4 pixels wide.


Constraints:
`widths.length == 26`
`2 <= widths[i] <= 10`
`1 <= s.length <= 1000`
`s` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 Certainly! We can solve the problem by iterating through the string `s` and calculating the width consumed on each line based on the `widths` array provided for each letter. The goal is to fill lines until we reach the 100-pixel limit, then start a new line and keep track of how many lines we used and the width of the last line.

Here’s how we can implement this in Python, ensuring that it conforms to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfLines(self, widths: List[int], s: str) -> List[int]:
        # The maximum width per line
        max_width = 100
        
        # To keep track of the number of lines and the current width
        line_count = 1  # Start with one line
        current_width = 0
        
        for char in s:
            # Get the width of the current character
            char_width = widths[ord(char) - ord('a')]
            
            # If adding this character exceeds the max width, increment the line count
            if current_width + char_width > max_width:
                line_count += 1  # Start a new line
                current_width = char_width  # Current character goes in the new line
            else:
                current_width += char_width  # Otherwise, add the width of the character
        
        return [line_count, current_width]

```

### Explanation:

1. **Input**: 
   - `widths`: This is a list of integers representing the pixel width of each lowercase letter, where `widths[0]` corresponds to 'a', `widths[1]` to 'b', and so on.
   - `s`: This is the input string consisting only of lowercase English letters.

2. **Define Constants**: 
   - Set `max_width` to `100`, which is the maximum width allowed per line.

3. **Initialize Counters**:
   - `line_count` is initialized to `1` because we will at least have one line.
   - `current_width` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the width used in the current line.

4. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string `s`, we:
     - Calculate the current character's width using `widths[ord(char) - ord('a')]`.
     - Check if adding this character would exceed `max_width`:
       - If it does, we increment the line count (indicating we need a new line) and reset `current_width` to the width of the current character.
       - If it doesn’t exceed, we simply add the character's width to `current_width`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return an array containing the total number of lines used and the width of the last line.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, since we are iterating through each character once.
- The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, and it follows the requirements provided for the problem.

# 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline

### Problem Description 
In a 2 dimensional array `grid`, each value `grid[i][j]` represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. 
At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

Example:
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
Explanation: 
The grid is:
[ [3, 0, 8, 4], 
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]
The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]
The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:
gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]
Notes: 
`1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50`.

All heights `grid[i][j]` are in the range `[0, 100]`.

All buildings in `grid[i][j]` occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a `1 x 1 x grid[i][j]` rectangular prism.

### Solution 
 To address the problem, we need to modify the heights of the buildings in a city represented by a 2D array (`grid`) such that the maximum height increases are performed without altering the skyline when viewed from any direction.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Understanding the Skylines**: The skyline from the four directions (top, bottom, left, right) is governed by the maximum heights in the respective rows and columns of the grid.
   - **Top/Bottom Skyline**: This corresponds to the maximum height in each column.
   - **Left/Right Skyline**: This corresponds to the maximum height in each row.

2. **Calculate Maximum Heights**:
   - We'll compute the maximum height for each row and for each column:
     - **Row Max Heights**: Iterating through each row will give us the maximum heights in rows.
     - **Column Max Heights**: Iterating through each column will give us the maximum heights in columns.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Increase**:
   - For each building in the original grid, the potential maximum height it can be increased to is determined by taking the minimum of the corresponding row and column max heights.
   - The increase for each building is the difference between this potential maximum height and its current height.
   - Sum all these increases to get the final result.

### Implementation

Here’s how this logic can be implemented in Python, formatted to run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        n = len(grid)
        m = len(grid[0])
        
        # Calculate row max heights and column max heights
        row_max = [0] * n
        col_max = [0] * m
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                row_max[i] = max(row_max[i], grid[i][j])
                col_max[j] = max(col_max[j], grid[i][j])
        
        # Calculate the maximum increase
        max_increase = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                # The new height is the minimum of the max heights
                new_height = min(row_max[i], col_max[j])
                # Increase is the diff between new height and current height
                max_increase += new_height - grid[i][j]
        
        return max_increase

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: We check if the grid is empty. If so, we return 0. We initialize arrays to store the maximum heights for rows and columns.
  
- **Compute Maximum Heights**:
  - We loop through each element in the grid with a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the rows, and the inner loop iterates through the columns.
  - We update the `row_max` and `col_max` arrays with the maximum values found in their respective rows and columns.

- **Calculate Maximum Increase**:
  - We again loop through each element of the grid. For each building at position `(i, j)`, we calculate what its new possible height can be, which is determined by the minimum of the maximum height of its row and the maximum height of its column.
  - The difference between this new height and the current height gives us the potential increase, and we sum these values to get the total maximum increase.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n * m), which is manageable given the constraints provided (grid size up to 50x50).

# 820. Short Encoding of Words

### Problem Description 
A valid encoding of an array of `words` is any reference string `s` and array of indices `indices` such that:
`words.length == indices.length`
The reference string `s` ends with the `'#'` character.

For each index `indices[i]`, the substring of `s` starting from `indices[i]` and up to (but not including) the next `'#'` character is equal to `words[i]`.

Given an array of `words`, return the length of the shortest reference string `s` possible of any valid encoding of `words`.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = `"time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5`].

words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"

Example 2:
Input: words = ["t"]
Output: 2
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "t#" and indices = [0].


Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 2000`
`1 <= words[i].length <= 7`
`words[i]` consists of only lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of finding the length of the shortest valid encoding string `s` for the given array of `words`, we can use a greedy approach which utilizes the properties of the suffixes of the words in the list. The key insight is that to minimize the length of the string `s`, we should avoid repeating characters in the `words` array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Use a Set for Suffixes**: Since we might end up with multiple words that share a common suffix, we will use a `set` to store the original words. This will help us to quickly determine if a word is a suffix of another.

2. **Iterate through the Words**: For each word in our list, we'll check if it's a suffix of any of the other words in the set. If it is not a suffix of any other words, we will include its length plus one (for the `#` character) in our total length.

3. **Count the Length**: We maintain a total length count which we will return at the end.

Below is the complete code following the LeetCode format, which includes the necessary class definition and function prototype.



```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLengthEncoding(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Use a set to store unique words
        word_set = set(words)
        
        # Variable to store the length of the encoding string
        length = 0
        
        # Check each word in the list
        for word in word_set:
            # For each word, we check if it's a suffix of any other word
            # If not, we add its length + 1 (for the '#')
            if not any(word != other and other.endswith(word) for other in word_set):
                length += len(word) + 1
                
        return length

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Class and Function Definition**: We define a class `Solution` and a method `minimumLengthEncoding` that takes a list of words as input.

- **Unique Words Storage**: We convert `words` into a set called `word_set` to ensure we only work with unique words.

- **Total Length Calculation**: We initialize a variable `length` to keep track of the total length of our valid encoding string.

- **Checking for Suffixes**: For each word, we check if it's a suffix of any other word. The condition in the `any` function ensures that we don't compare the word with itself (`word != other`).

- **Summing Up Lengths**: If the word is not a suffix of any other word, we add its length plus one (for the `#` character) to our total length.

- **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the calculated length.

The algorithm is efficient given the constraints of the problem and runs in a time complexity of O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the maximum length of a word, which is manageable within the provided limits.

# 821. Shortest Distance to a Character

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return an array of integers `answer` where `answer.length == s.length` and `answer[i]` is the distance from index `i` to the closest occurrence of character `c` in `s`.

The distance between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs` is the absolute value function.


Example 1:
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).

The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.

The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 3.

For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.

The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.


Example 2:
Input: s = "aaab", c = "b"
Output: [3,2,1,0]

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 104`
`s[i]` and `c` are lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that `c` occurs at least once in `s`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the distance of each character in the string `s` to the nearest occurrence of the character `c`, we can follow a two-pass approach. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: Create an array `answer` of the same length as `s`, filled with a default value (in this case, a large number) to represent initially unknown distances.

2. **First Pass (Left to Right)**: Traverse the string from the left to the right. Whenever the character `c` is encountered, set the distance for that index to `0` because it is at its own location. For all other indices, if we are still recording distances, update the distance based on the previously found occurrence of `c`.

3. **Second Pass (Right to Left)**: Traverse the string from the right to the left. Perform a similar update, checking if the distance to the closest `c` found earlier is shorter than the current known distance in `answer`. This ensures that for each character we look at the closest occurrence of `c` in both directions.

4. **Return the result**: Finally, return the `answer` array which now holds the required distances.

The implementation in Python is as follows:



```python
class Solution:
    def shortestToChar(self, s: str, c: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(s)
        answer = [float('inf')] * n  # Initialize distances to infinity
        
        # First pass: Left to Right
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == c:
                answer[i] = 0  # Distance to itself
            elif i > 0:  # If not the first character
                answer[i] = answer[i - 1] + 1  # Increment distance from left
            
        # Second pass: Right to Left
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == c:
                answer[i] = 0  # Distance to itself
            elif i < n - 1:  # If not the last character
                answer[i] = min(answer[i], answer[i + 1] + 1)  # Choose smaller distance
        
        return answer

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Initialization**: We start by setting the length of the string `s` to `n` and create the `answer` list filled with `float('inf')` to represent that we have yet to find the closest occurrence of `c` for each index.

- **First Pass**: 
    - We iterate through each index. If we find `c`, we set that position in `answer` to `0`.
    - If it's not `c` and we are past the first index, we set the value at `answer[i]` to be `answer[i - 1] + 1`. This incrementally calculates the distance from the last found occurrence of `c`.

- **Second Pass**: 
    - Now we reverse iterate through the string from right to left. As we check each index, if we find `c`, we set it to `0`.
    - If it’s not `c`, we compare the current `answer[i]` with `answer[i + 1] + 1`, which gives the distance from the closest `c` found to the right. We take the minimum of these two values to ensure we have the shortest distance.

- **Final Output**: The `answer` list now contains the distances for each character in `s` to the nearest occurrence of `c`, and we return it.

This solution efficiently computes the distances in O(n) time with O(n) additional space for the answer array, making it suitable for the given constraints.

# 822. Card Flipping Game

### Problem Description 
On a table are `N` cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 
If the number `X` on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output `0`.

Here, `fronts[i]` and `backs[i]` represent the number on the front and back of card `i`. 
A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.


Example:
Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
Output: `2`
Explanation: If we flip the second card, the fronts are `[1,3,4,4,7]` and the backs are `[1,2,4,1,3]`.

We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so `2` is good.

Note:
`1 <= fronts.length == backs.length <= 1000`.

`1 <= fronts[i] <= 2000`.

`1 <= backs[i] <= 2000`.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest positive integer `X` such that `X` is on the back of a chosen card (after potentially flipping it), and `X` does not appear on the front of any card. If no such number exists, we return `0`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Data Structures**: We'll use two sets. One set (`front_set`) to hold all the numbers present on the front of the cards, and another set (`back_set`) to hold all the numbers present on the back of the cards.

2. **Populating the Sets**: We iterate through the list of cards, adding each number from the fronts to `front_set` and each number from the backs to `back_set`.

3. **Finding Good Numbers**: After populating the sets, we can then check each number in `back_set`. We'll determine if it's not present in `front_set`. If it satisfies this condition, we add it to a list of good numbers.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the smallest number from our list of good numbers. If the list is empty, we return `0`.

Let's implement this in Python following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def findGoodInteger(self, fronts: List[int], backs: List[int]) -> int:
        front_set = set(fronts)
        back_set = set(backs)
        
        # Initialize a variable to store the smallest good integer
        smallest_good_integer = float('inf')
        
        # Check each number in back_set if it's not in front_set
        for num in back_set:
            if num not in front_set:
                smallest_good_integer = min(smallest_good_integer, num)
        
        # If we found a good integer, return it, otherwise return 0
        return smallest_good_integer if smallest_good_integer != float('inf') else 0

```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1**: Defines a class `Solution` that contains our method `findGoodInteger`.
- **Parameters**: The method takes two parameters, `fronts` and `backs`, which are both lists of integers.
- **Line 2-3**: We create two sets, `front_set` and `back_set`, to hold the unique numbers from the front and back of the cards, respectively.
- **Line 6**: We initialize `smallest_good_integer` to infinity (`float('inf')`), which will help us find the minimum good number.
- **Line 9-11**: We loop through each number in `back_set` and check if it exists in `front_set`. If it doesn't, we update `smallest_good_integer` to be the minimum of its current value and the found number.
- **Line 14**: Finally, we check if we found any good integer. If not, we return `0`. Otherwise, we return the smallest good integer.

This solution is efficient due to the use of sets, allowing for average O(1) time complexity for lookups, making the overall complexity O(N), where N is the number of cards. The space complexity is also O(N) due to the storage of the sets. This is well within the problem's constraints.

# 823. Binary Trees With Factors

### Problem Description 
Given an array of unique integers, `arr`, where each integer `arr[i]` is strictly greater than `1`.

We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.

Return the number of binary trees we can make. The answer may be too large so return the answer modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make these trees: `[2], [4], [4, 2, 2]`

Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,4,5,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can make these trees: `[2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2]`.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
`2 <= arr[i] <= 109`
All the values of `arr` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of distinct binary trees that can be constructed from a given array of unique integers where each integer is greater than `1`, we can utilize dynamic programming and hashing to keep track of previously computed results.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Tree Structure**:
   - A binary tree can have a leaf node which is a single integer from the array.
   - For non-leaf nodes, each integer can be represented as the product of the values of its child nodes. For example, if `node = a * b`, where `a` and `b` are values derived from child nodes, then the subtree with `node` as a root can be considered as effectively generating those child subtrees.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will maintain a dictionary `dp` where `dp[x]` represents how many distinct configurations (binary trees) can be formed with `x` as the root.
   - For each integer in the array, consider all pairs of integers from `arr` whose product gives this integer. The number of trees that can generate the current integer as a non-leaf node can be calculated using the number of trees formed by each of the children—specifically, combine all possible pairs.

3. **Handling Products**:
   - For each integer `node` derived from products of pairs `(left, right)`, where `node = left * right` and both `left` and `right` are from the array, update the count in `dp[node]` by multiplying the number of ways to form `left` and `right` (stored in `dp[left]` and `dp[right]`).

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The final answer will be the sum of all values in `dp` since each distinct value can act as a tree root.

### Implementation

Here's the complete Python implementation of the above strategy:



```python
class Solution:
    def numOfWays(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Dictionary to store the number of ways to form a tree with a specific root
        dp = {}
        # Sort the array to calculate products from the smallest values
        arr.sort()
        
        result = 0
        
        for node in arr:
            dp[node] = 1  # Start by counting the leaf node itself
            
            # Check all possible (left, right) pairs to generate this node
            for left in arr:
                if left >= node:
                    break
                if node % left == 0:  # Check if it can be a left child
                    right = node // left  # The right value needed to form the product
                    if right in dp:  # Check if right is also in our dp dictionary
                        dp[node] += dp[left] * dp[right]  # Calculate number of trees
                        dp[node] %= MOD  # Ensure we take mod at every step

            result = (result + dp[node]) % MOD  # Total up all trees

        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We define a large constant `MOD` to handle large numbers as the problem specifies to return results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The `dp` dictionary is initialized to store the number of distinct trees possible for each integer.

2. **Count Trees**:
   - We iterate through each integer in the sorted array and initialize `dp[node]` to `1` (for the tree consisting of just the node).
   - We generate potential parent nodes by checking possible pairs `(left, right)` where `left` is less than `node` and forms a clean division of `node`.

3. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - As we compute possible trees for each node, we add to `result` which keeps track of all the valid constructions.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the accumulated result which is the total number of distinct trees.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the size of `arr`, due to the pair checking within a double loop, which is efficient enough given the constraints.

This approach guarantees that we systematically explore all ways to construct binary trees using the given unique integers properly.

# 848. Shifting Letters

### Problem Description 
We have a string `S` of lowercase letters, and an integer array `shifts`.

Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). 
For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i+1` letters of `S`, `x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `S` are applied.


Example 1:
Input: S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: 
We start with "abc".

After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc".

After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc".

After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.

Note:
`1 <= S.length = shifts.length <= 20000`
`0 <= shifts[i] <= 10 ^ 9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to apply a series of shifts to the characters in a string `S`. The goal is to efficiently compute the final version of the string after performing the shifts defined in the `shifts` array. Each `shifts[i]` tells us how many times to shift the first `i + 1` letters of `S`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Understanding Shifts**: Each character shift follows the pattern of the alphabet, where 'z' wraps around to 'a'. To perform a shift efficiently, we use the modulo operation with 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet).

2. **Reverse Processing**: Start from the end of the array and calculate a cumulative shift that applies for all preceding letters as well. This way, for each letter, we can accumulate how much each character should be shifted in a single pass.

3. **Updating Each Character**: For each character in the string `S`, we apply the total effective shift derived from the cumulative sum of shifts up to that character index.

4. **Constructing the Result**: Build the final result string based on the updated characters after applying the respective shifts.

Here's a detailed implementation of the solution following the outlined approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def shiftingLetters(self, S: str, shifts: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(S)
        # We will create a cumulative array for shifts
        total_shifts = 0
        
        # Accumulate shifts in reverse order
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            total_shifts += shifts[i]  # Update the total shifts
            # Since we are shifting characters, we can apply the modulo operator
            total_shifts %= 26  # We only need to consider shifts modulo 26
            # Shift the character at position i
            # (ord(S[i]) - ord('a')) gives us the current position in the alphabet
            new_char = chr((ord(S[i]) - ord('a') + total_shifts) % 26 + ord('a'))
            S = S[:i] + new_char + S[i+1:]  # Update the string with the new character
        
        return S


```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` with a method `shiftingLetters`.
   
2. **Input Parameters**: The method accepts a string `S` and a list `shifts`.

3. **Cumulative Shifts**: We initialize `total_shifts` to keep track of how many shifts we need to apply to the current character.

4. **Reverse Iteration**: Using a for loop that starts from the last character to the first one:
   - We update `total_shifts` by adding `shifts[i]`.
   - To handle larger shifts that exceed the alphabet count, we take `total_shifts % 26`.
   - We calculate the new shifted character by adjusting its ASCII value, wrapping around if necessary.
   - Finally, we update the corresponding position in the string `S` with the new character.

5. **Returning the Result**: After processing all characters, we return the modified string `S`.

This implementation is efficient, operating in linear time O(n), which is suitable given the constraints of the problem (up to 20,000 characters). The space complexity is O(1) outside of the input size since we're modifying the string in place.

# 869. Reordered Power of 2

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer `n`. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return `true` if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: n = 16
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: n = 24
Output: false

Example 5:
Input: n = 46
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether the digits of a given integer `n` can be rearranged to form a power of two, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Generate Powers of Two**: First, we need to identify all powers of two that are possible up to the maximum constraint of `n`, which is \(10^9\). Since \(2^{30} = 1073741824\) exceeds this limit, we only need to consider powers of two from \(2^0\) to \(2^{29}\).

2. **Digit Count Comparison**: We will convert both the number `n` and each power of two into their string representations and create a character count (or frequency count) for the digits. This is done using a `Counter` from the `collections` module in Python. If the character counts match, it means we can rearrange the digits of `n` to form that power of two.

3. **Final Check**: If any power of two matches the digit count of `n`, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

Here’s the implementation in Python following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def reorderedPowerOf2(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # Generate all powers of 2 up to 10^9
        powers_of_two = [2 ** i for i in range(30)]
        
        # Get the digit count of the given number n
        n_count = Counter(str(n))
        
        # Check if any power of two matches the digit count of n
        for power in powers_of_two:
            if Counter(str(power)) == n_count:
                return True
        
        return False

```

### Explanation:
1. **Generating Powers of Two**:
   - We use a list comprehension to generate all powers of two from \(2^0\) to \(2^{29}\). This is efficient because there are only 30 such numbers.

2. **Counting Digits**:
   - The Counter creates a frequency dictionary where keys are the digits and values are their frequencies in the number `n`.

3. **Comparison Loop**:
   - We iterate through the pre-computed powers of two and create a Counter for each power. If the counted digits of any power match that of `n`, we know it's possible to rearrange the digits to form that power of two.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If a match is found, we immediately return `True`. If we finish the loop without finding a match, we return `False`.

This solution is efficient, running in a constant time complexity related to the number of powers of two (which is very small). The most computationally intense operation is the creation of the `Counter`, which is linear with respect to the number of digits, but since the maximum number of digits of `n` is 10 (for \(10^9\)), this is manageable. 

Thus, this method effectively checks if we can rearrange the digits of `n` to form any power of two in a straightforward and efficient manner.

# 878. Nth Magical Number

### Problem Description 
A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.

Given the three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, return the `nth` magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6

Example 3:
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 4
Output: 10

Example 4:
Input: n = 3, a = 6, b = 4
Output: 8

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 109`
`2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the `nth` magical number divisible by either `a` or `b`, we can use a mathematical approach leveraging the properties of multiples and the Least Common Multiple (LCM). 

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Understanding Magical Numbers**: A magical number is any positive integer that is divisible by `a` or `b`. Examples of magical numbers given `a = 2` and `b = 3` would be `{2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...}`.

2. **Counting Magical Numbers**: To find the `nth` magical number, we need a way to efficiently count how many magical numbers are less than or equal to a given number `x`. The count can be derived using the following formula:
   - Count of magical numbers ≤ `x` = `(x // a) + (x // b) - (x // lcm(a, b))`
   
   Here:
   - `x // a` gives the count of numbers divisible by `a`.
   - `x // b` gives the count of numbers divisible by `b`.
   - `x // lcm(a, b)` is subtracted because those numbers were counted twice (once for `a` and once for `b`).

3. **Finding the nth Magical Number**: We can use binary search to find the smallest number `x` for which the count of magical numbers ≤ `x` is `n`. The search range can be defined as `1` to `n * min(a, b)` because:
   - The worst case would be taking `n` multiples of the smaller of `a` and `b`.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the answer needs to be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`, we should ensure this during calculations.

### Implementation:
Based on this breakdown, the following Python code can be used as a solution that adheres to the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def nthMagicalNumber(self, n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Function to calculate the LCM
        def lcm(x, y):
            from math import gcd
            return (x * y) // gcd(x, y)
        
        # Binary search setup
        left = 1
        right = n * min(a, b)
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Binary search for the nth magical number
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            count = (mid // a) + (mid // b) - (mid // lcm_ab)
            
            if count < n:
                left = mid + 1  # We need more magical numbers
            else:
                right = mid  # We have enough magical numbers
        
        return left % MOD

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.nthMagicalNumber(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 2
# print(solution.nthMagicalNumber(4, 2, 3))  # Output: 6
# print(solution.nthMagicalNumber(5, 2, 4))  # Output: 10
# print(solution.nthMagicalNumber(3, 6, 4))  # Output: 8

```

### Explanation:
- We define the `lcm` function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
- Using binary search, we repeatedly narrow down our search range until we find the `nth` magical number.
- Each iteration calculates the count of magical numbers less than or equal to `mid`, adjusts the search bounds accordingly (either increase `left` or reduce `right`).
- Finally, we return the `left` variable (representing the nth magical number) modulo `10^9 + 7`. 

This approach is efficient, leveraging mathematical insights to minimize the number of calculations required, and works well within the provided constraints.

# 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes

### Problem Description 
You are given an `n x n` `grid` where we place some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes that are axis-aligned with the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of the cell `(i, j)`.

We view the projection of these cubes onto the `xy`, `yz`, and `zx` planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[2]]
Output: 5

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14

Example 5:
Input: grid = [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21

Constraints:
`n == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= n <= 50`
`0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the total area of the projections of cubes in a given `n x n` grid, we need to understand the concept of projections on three different planes: 

1. **xy-plane projection:** This is seen from the top and is simply the count of all non-zero cells. Each non-zero cell contributes an area of 1.
  
2. **yz-plane projection:** This projection views the cubes from the front side (along the y-axis) and is determined by finding the maximum height of the cubes in each column. The total area is the sum of the maximum values for each column.

3. **zx-plane projection:** This projection views the cubes from the side (along the x-axis) and is determined by finding the maximum height of the cubes in each row. The total area is the sum of the maximum values for each row.

The final area will be the sum of all three projections.

Here's a breakdown of the code that implements this solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def projectionArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Initialize area projection counters
        xy_area = 0  # Area for xy projection
        yz_area = 0  # Area for yz projection
        zx_area = 0  # Area for zx projection
        
        n = len(grid)  # Get size of the grid
        
        # Iterate through each cell in the grid
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] > 0:
                    xy_area += 1  # Count for xy projection
                yz_area += grid[i][j]  # Add height for yz projection
                zx_area += 1 if grid[i][j] > 0 else 0  # Count for zx projection (1 for presence of height)

        # yz_area needs just the maximum height per column
        max_row_heights = [max(row) for row in grid]  # Maximum height from each row
        max_col_heights = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(n)]  # Maximum height from each column
        
        # Total projected area
        total_area = xy_area + sum(max_row_heights) + sum(max_col_heights)
        
        return total_area

# Example usage
grid1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.projectionArea(grid1))  # Output: 17

grid2 = [[2]]
print(sol.projectionArea(grid2))  # Output: 5

grid3 = [[1, 0], [0, 2]]
print(sol.projectionArea(grid3))  # Output: 8

grid4 = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]
print(sol.projectionArea(grid4))  # Output: 14

grid5 = [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
print(sol.projectionArea(grid5))  # Output: 21

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization:** We prepare three variables to hold the areas of the projections: `xy_area`, `yz_area`, and `zx_area`.

2. **Iterating through the grid:** We loop through each element in the grid:
   - For the **xy projection**, we check if the grid value is greater than zero and increment the `xy_area`.
   - For the **yz projection**, we add the height of the current grid cell to `yz_area`, as each non-zero contributes to the overall height.
   - For **zx projection**, while counting we're just noting if there's something (greater than zero).

3. **Calculating maximums:** We compute the maximum heights for each row and column to finalize the contributions to `yz_area` and `zx_area`.

4. **Calculating the total area:** The total area is the sum of the three calculated areas.

5. **Returning the final result:** Finally, we return the computed total area.

This complete setup can be directly submitted to LeetCode to solve the problem based on the format of the coding environment provided.

# 892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes

### Problem Description 
You are given an `n x n` `grid` where you have placed some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes. Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of cell `(i, j)`.

After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.

Return the total surface area of the resulting shapes.

Note: The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2]]
Output: 10

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 34

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 16

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 32

Example 5:
Input: grid = [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 46

Constraints:
`n == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= n <= 50`
`0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the 3D shapes formed by cubes stacked in a grid. The surface area is defined by the exposed faces of the cubes after they've been stacked. 

Let's break down the approach to tackle this:

1. **Understanding the Surface Area Calculation**:
   - Each cube has a total of 6 faces.
   - Every cube contributes to its own surface area, but the faces that are touching other cubes do not contribute to the external surface area.
   - For each cube positioned at `(i, j)` with height `v`, the contribution to the surface area can be calculated as follows:
     - Total area contributed by the cubes = `v * 6` (for all cubes).
     - Subtract the area of the faces that are adjacent to other cubes:
       - For the left face (if `j > 0`): `min(v, grid[i][j-1])`
       - For the right face (if `j < n-1`): `min(v, grid[i][j+1])`
       - For the front face (if `i > 0`): `min(v, grid[i-1][j])`
       - For the back face (if `i < n-1`): `min(v, grid[i+1][j])`
     - The bottom face of the structure also counts for the surface area irrespective of any adjacent cubes.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Iterate over each cell in the grid.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` with height `v`, calculate:
     - `total_area` initialized to `v * 6`.
     - Deduct the areas of the shared faces with adjacent cubes.
     - Add 1 for the bottom face.
   - Finally, return the total surface area.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(n^2) time due to the nested loop through the grid, which is efficient given the constraints.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def surfaceArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        total_area = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] > 0:
                    total_area += grid[i][j] * 6  # each cube contributes 6
                    total_area -= self._overlapArea(grid, i, j)  # remove overlap area
                    total_area += 1  # account for the bottom face of the tower
        
        return total_area
    
    def _overlapArea(self, grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int) -> int:
        overlap = 0
        
        # Check adjacent cubes and calculate the overlap area
        if i > 0:  # Up
            overlap += min(grid[i][j], grid[i - 1][j])
        if i < len(grid) - 1:  # Down
            overlap += min(grid[i][j], grid[i + 1][j])
        if j > 0:  # Left
            overlap += min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j - 1])
        if j < len(grid) - 1:  # Right
            overlap += min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j + 1])
        
        return overlap

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `surfaceArea` function iterates through the grid.
- For each cube (or stack of cubes) at `(i, j)`, it first adds `v * 6` to the total area.
- The `_overlapArea` helper function calculates how much area needs to be subtracted by checking adjacent positions.
- Finally, the bottom face is accounted for in the total surface area.
- The function returns the computed total surface area.

This approach meets the problem requirements and efficiently calculates the desired output.

# 903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence

### Problem Description 
We are given `S`, a length `n` string of characters from the set `{'D', 'I'}`. (These letters stand for "decreasing" and "increasing".)
A valid permutation is a permutation `P[0], P[1], ..., P[n]` of integers `{0, 1, ..., n}`, such that for all `i`:
If `S[i] == 'D'`, then `P[i] > P[i+1]`, and;
If `S[i] == 'I'`, then `P[i] < P[i+1]`.

How many valid permutations are there?  Since the answer may be large, return your answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: "DID"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The 5 valid permutations of (0, 1, 2, 3) are:
(1, 0, 3, 2)
(2, 0, 3, 1)
(2, 1, 3, 0)
(3, 0, 2, 1)
(3, 1, 2, 0)
Note:
`1 <= S.length <= 200`
`S` consists only of characters from the set `{'D', 'I'}`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting valid permutations based on the string of characters 'D' and 'I', we can employ a dynamic programming approach. Let's break down the steps and the rationale behind the solution.

### Problem Explanation
Given a string `S` of length `n`, we need to find permutations of integers from `0` to `n` such that:
- If the ith character in `S` is 'D', then the ith integer in the permutation must be greater than the (i+1)th integer.
- If the ith character is 'I', then the ith integer must be less than the (i+1)th integer.

### Dynamic Programming Approach
1. **Define a DP Table**: We'll use a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of valid permutations of the first `i` numbers (i.e., `0` to `i-1`) that satisfy the conditions up to index `j` in `S`.
  
2. **Initialization**: Base case will have `dp[0][0] = 1` since there's one way to arrange zero numbers.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: 
   - For each number of elements from `1` to `n`, and for each character in `S`, we will update the `dp` table based on whether the character is 'D' or 'I':
     - If `S[j-1]` is 'D', we consider all the valid permutations formed by taking a block of decreasing numbers.
     - If `S[j-1]` is 'I', we consider all the valid configurations formed by increasing sequences. 

4. **Summing Up Valid Permutations**: The total valid permutations will be stored in `dp[n][0]`, which provides us the count of valid arrangements.

### Python Code
Below is the Python solution following the logic described above:



```python
class Solution:
    def numPermsDISequence(self, S: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(S)
        # Initialize the DP table
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case

        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, n + 2):  # We need dp for numbers 0 to n (thus n + 1)
            for j in range(i + 1):  # Total slots for current i are i + 1
                if j > 0:
                    # If S[i-1] == 'I', count increasing sequences
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1]  # Adding a number at position j (I case)
                if j < i:
                    # If S[i-1] == 'D', count decreasing sequences
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j]  # Keeping j as is for but using the larger of the remaining (D case)

                dp[i][j] %= MOD  # Ensuring the number remains within MOD
        
        return dp[n][0]  # The answer is found

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Constants**: We define `MOD` for taking modulo `10^9 + 7` and `n` as the length of the input string `S`.
2. **DP Initialization**: We create a dynamic programming table `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)`.
3. **Filling Logic**: We iterate through each length and determine how to fill the table based on whether characters are 'D' or 'I'.
4. **Final Result**: The desired count of valid permutations is in `dp[n][0]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), since we have a nested loop corresponding to the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), for the storage of the DP table.

This code is ready to run on LeetCode and adheres to the expected input and output formats.


# 912. Sort an Array

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 50000`
`-50000 <= nums[i] <= 50000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of sorting an array of integers in ascending order, we can make use of Python's built-in sorting capabilities which are efficient and well-suited for this task. The built-in sorting functions are based on Timsort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average. Given the constraints of the problem, this approach will be efficient.

Below is the Python code that directly follows the LeetCode solution format. This code defines a function `sortArray` that takes an array of integers `nums` and returns the sorted array. 

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        # Sort the array using Python's built-in sorted function
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
        return sorted_nums

```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Class Definition**: We start by defining a class named `Solution`. This is a standard practice in LeetCode problems as they usually expect the solution to be encapsulated within a class.

2. **Method Definition**: Inside the `Solution` class, we define a method called `sortArray` that takes one parameter:
   - `nums`: a list of integers which we need to sort.

3. **Sorting Process**:
   - We use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the array `nums`. The `sorted()` function:
     - Accepts an iterable and returns a new sorted list from the elements of that iterable.
     - By default, it sorts in ascending order. This fits our requirement perfectly.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the sorted list `sorted_nums` is returned.

### Examples and Outputs

- For an input of `nums = [5, 2, 3, 1]`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 5]`.
- For an input of `nums = [5, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0]`, the output will be `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 5]`.

### Constraints Handling

The constraints specify that:
- The length of `nums` will be at least 1 and at most 50000.
- Each integer in `nums` will be between -50000 and 50000.

The built-in sorting function can handle this volume and range of data comfortably.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently sorts the given array of integers in ascending order while adhering to the input specifications. You can copy and paste the above code directly into LeetCode to test and submit your solution.

# 940. Distinct Subsequences II

### Problem Description 
Given a string `S`, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of `S` .

Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".


Example 2:
Input: "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa" and "aba".


Example 3:
Input: "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".

Note:
`S` contains only lowercase letters.

`1 <= S.length <= 2000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the distinct non-empty subsequences of a string `S`, we can use dynamic programming. The key idea is to use an array where each index represents the number of distinct subsequences that can be formed using the first `i` characters of the string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach we'll take:

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We will create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the count of distinct subsequences of the substring `S[0:i]`.
   
2. **Initial Value**: We start with `dp[0] = 1`, representing the empty subsequence.

3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each character in the string, we can either include or exclude it. The formula can be described as follows:
   - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] * 2`. This gives us two choices for each subsequence formed up to index `i-1` — include `S[i-1]` or not.
   
4. **Handling Duplicates**: To handle duplicates, we need to keep track of the last occurrence of each character. If the character has appeared before, we subtract the number of subsequences formed before its last occurrence (to avoid double counting).
   
5. **Final Count**: Since we only care about non-empty subsequences, the final count will be `dp[n] - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string.

6. **Modulus Operation**: As the result can be large, we will take modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Python Code

Here is the implementation of the above approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSubseqII(self, S: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(S)
        
        # dp[i] will store the number of distinct subsequences for S[:i]
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1  # Base case: 1 way to choose an empty subsequence
        
        last_occurrence = {}  # This will track the last occurrence of each character
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            char = S[i - 1]
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * 2) % MOD  # Every subsequence can either include or exclude S[i-1]
            
            if char in last_occurrence:
                # Subtract the subsequences that were counted twice
                dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[last_occurrence[char] - 1]) % MOD
            
            # Update the last occurrence of the current character
            last_occurrence[char] = i
        
        # We subtract 1 to exclude the empty subsequence
        return (dp[n] - 1 + MOD) % MOD

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first define the `distinctSubseqII` method which takes an input string `S`.
- We initialize the `dp` array and set the base case `dp[0] = 1`.
- We also maintain a dictionary `last_occurrence` to keep track of the last seen index of each character.
- For each character in the string:
  - Update `dp[i]` based on `dp[i-1]`.
  - If the character has appeared before, we subtract the count of subsequences that were counted before its last index to avoid duplicates.
- Finally, we return `dp[n] - 1` to get the count of non-empty subsequences, ensuring we handle large numbers using modulo.

This solution efficiently counts the distinct subsequences while handling duplicates correctly, and runs in O(n) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints (with `|S|` up to 2000).

# 941. Valid Mountain Array

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:
`arr.length >= 3`
There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
	
`arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] `
`arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,1]
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: arr = [3,5,5]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: arr = [0,3,2,1]
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 104`
`0 <= arr[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 To determine whether a given array is a valid mountain array, we can follow a structured approach to check the two main conditions for a mountain array. Here’s how we can implement this in Python, suitable for running on the LeetCode platform.

### Explanation of the Requirements

1. **Array Length Check**: We need to ensure the length of the array is at least 3, because a mountain must have at least one peak and both sides of the peak.
  
2. **Increasing Sequence**: Start from the beginning of the array and check that the numbers strictly increase until we find a peak. The peak is defined as any index `i` where `arr[i]` is greater than both `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i+1]`.

3. **Decreasing Sequence**: After finding the peak, we check that the numbers strictly decrease until the end of the array.

### Steps to Implement the Solution

1. Initialize two pointers: one to check for the increasing part and one to check for the decreasing part.
2. Traverse the array using the first pointer to find the peak.
3. After finding the peak, use the second pointer to check for the decreasing part.
4. Check the conditions to confirm the array is a mountain array.

### Python Code

Here's the complete code following the LeetCode structure:



```python
class Solution:
    def validMountainArray(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(arr)
        
        # Step 1: Check if the array length is less than 3
        if n < 3:
            return False
        
        # Step 2: Find the peak of the mountain
        i = 0

        # Ascend to the peak
        while i < n - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
            i += 1
        
        # Step 3: Check if we didn't reach the first or last element
        if i == 0 or i == n - 1:
            return False
        
        # Step 4: Descend from the peak
        while i < n - 1 and arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            i += 1
        
        # Step 5: If we reached the end, it is a valid mountain array
        return i == n - 1

```

### Detailed Walkthrough

- **Initial Checks**: We first check if the array has at least three elements. If not, we return `False` immediately.
- **Finding the Peak**: We use a `while` loop to increment the index `i` while the next element is greater than the current one. This captures the increasing sequence.
- **Validation of Peak Location**: After finding the peak, we check that `i` is not at the beginning (`0`) or at the end (`n - 1`). This ensures that there is at least one element before and after the peak.
- **Descending Check**: We use another `while` loop to check for a strictly decreasing sequence from the peak until the last element.
- **Final Condition**: If we reach the end of the array with our index `i`, we confirm that it’s a valid mountain array.

### Conclusion

The implementation checks for both ascending and descending conditions, ensuring the properties of a mountain array are satisfied as specified in the problem statement. The overall complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, making it efficient for the given constraints.

# 956. Tallest Billboard

### Problem Description 
You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.

You are given a collection of `rods` that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths `1`, `2`, and `3`, you can weld them together to make a support of length `6`.

Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard, return `0`.


Example 1:
Input: rods = [1,2,3,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.


Example 2:
Input: rods = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.


Example 3:
Input: rods = [1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= rods.length <= 20`
`1 <= rods[i] <= 1000`
`sum(rods[i]) <= 5000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the height of a billboard supported by two equal-height steel supports made from a collection of rods, we need to split the given rods into two groups such that the sum of the lengths of rods in each group is equal. The goal is to find the maximum possible height of these supports.

This problem is a variation of the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem, which can be efficiently tackled using dynamic programming (DP). Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

### Plan:

1. **Define the Problem**: We will track the possible sums we can achieve using the rods and see which sums can be realized twice (once for each support).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use a DP approach where we maintain a dictionary (or a dynamic programming array) to keep track of the maximum possible sum we can achieve with a given difference between the two groups.

3. **Iterate through Rods**: For each rod, we update our DP state to consider both adding it to one group or subtracting it to the other group.

4. **Calculate the Maximum Height**: Iterate over possible sums and check which is the highest sum that can be realized twice.

5. **Return the Result**: If no valid configuration is found, return `0`.

### Python Code:

Here is how this can be implemented in Python according to the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:
        # DP dictionary where keys are the difference between the two parts,
        # and values are the maximum height achieved for that difference
        dp = {0: 0}
        
        for rod in rods:
            # We create a new state to keep track of updates in this round
            new_dp = dp.copy()
            
            for diff, height in dp.items():
                # Option 1: Add rod to the first side (diff increases)
                new_dp[diff + rod] = max(new_dp.get(diff + rod, 0), height)
                
                # Option 2: Add rod to the second side (diff decreases)
                new_dp[abs(diff - rod)] = max(new_dp.get(abs(diff - rod), 0), height + (diff if diff - rod >= 0 else 0))
                
            # Update dp for the next iteration
            dp = new_dp
        
        return dp.get(0, 0)


```

### Explanation of Code:

- **Initialization**: We start with a dictionary `dp` initialized with `{0: 0}` to represent that with a difference of `0`, we can achieve a height of `0`.

- **Iterating through Rods**: For each rod, we create a `new_dp` to represent potential sums with the current rod considered.

- **Updating States**:
  - **Add to first side**: This increases the difference by the length of the current rod.
  - **Add to second side**: This reduces the difference (hence taking the absolute) and contributes to the height if we can afford to add the excess from the first group's height.

- **Updating DP State**: After considering all rods, we check the final state in `dp` to see the maximum height achievable when the difference is `0`, which will be stored under `dp[0]`.

- **Return Result**: If we could not achieve any pair of subsets (i.e., height with equal sums), `dp.get(0, 0)` will return `0`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(N * D) where N is the number of rods, and D is the maximum difference that can occur, where `D` can be at most the sum of all rods. Given the constraints, it is efficient enough to run within limits.

# 970. Powerful Integers

### Problem Description 
Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

An integer is powerful if it can be represented as `xi + yj` for some integers `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

You may return the answer in any order. In your answer, each value should occur at most once.


Example 1:
Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
Explanation:
2 = 20 + 30
3 = 21 + 30
4 = 20 + 31
5 = 21 + 31
7 = 22 + 31
9 = 23 + 30
10 = 20 + 32

Example 2:
Input: x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15
Output: [2,4,6,8,10,14]

Constraints:
`1 <= x, y <= 100`
`0 <= bound <= 106`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding all the powerful integers that can be expressed in the form \(x^i + y^j\) for non-negative integers \(i\) and \(j\), and whose values are less than or equal to a given bound, we can employ a systematic approach:

1. **Understanding the Bounds**: For given values of `x` and `y`, we need to calculate `x^i` and `y^j` until they exceed the `bound`. This will prevent unnecessary calculations.

2. **Generating Candidate Values**:
   - We iterate over possible values of `i` to compute \(x^i\) while it remains within the bound.
   - Similarly, for each \(x^i\), we iterate over possible values of `j` to compute \(y^j\) and form the sums \(x^i + y^j\).
  
3. **De-duplication**: As we generate these sums, we can use a set to store the values to ensure uniqueness.

4. **Forming the Output**: Finally, we convert the set to a list and return it as our result.

Now, let's implement this in Python following the LeetCode structure.



```python
class Solution:
    def powerfulIntegers(self, x: int, y: int, bound: int) -> List[int]:
        powerful_integers = set()
        
        # If x or y is 1, we only need one loop as higher powers will not change the value
        if x == 1:
            i_val = 1
            while i_val + 1 <= bound:
                powerful_integers.add(i_val + 1)  # since j starts from 0, y^0 = 1
                i_val += 1
            return list(powerful_integers)
        
        if y == 1:
            j_val = 1
            while j_val + 1 <= bound:
                powerful_integers.add(1 + j_val)  # since i starts from 0, x^0 = 1
                j_val += 1
            return list(powerful_integers)

        # Otherwise, we loop for powers of x and y
        i = 0
        while True:
            x_power = x ** i
            if x_power > bound:
                break
            j = 0
            while True:
                y_power = y ** j
                total = x_power + y_power
                if total > bound:
                    break
                powerful_integers.add(total)
                j += 1
            i += 1

        return list(powerful_integers)

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We define a class named `Solution` with a method `powerfulIntegers` that takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `bound`.
  
2. We utilize a set called `powerful_integers` to store unique powerful integers.

3. We handle special cases where either `x` or `y` is `1`. Since higher powers of `1` will not contribute new values, we only need to add `1` and increment the other value.

4. For general cases, we use nested loops:
   - The outer loop increases the exponent `i`, calculating \(x^i\).
   - The inner loop increases the exponent `j`, calculating \(y^j\).
   - Each combination of \(x^i + y^j\) is added to the set if it does not exceed `bound`.

5. Finally, we convert the set to a list and return it.

This solution efficiently calculates and returns the powerful integers up to the specified bound without unnecessarily repeating calculations, and it's structured to run directly on the LeetCode platform.

# 1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5

### Problem Description 
Given an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, consider `N_i`: the i-th subarray from `A[0]` to `A[i]` interpreted as a binary number (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit.)
Return a list of booleans `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if and only if `N_i` is divisible by 5.


Example 1:
Input: [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: 
The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.  Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.


Example 2:
Input: [1,1,1]
Output: [false,false,false]

Example 3:
Input: [0,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false,false,true,false]

Example 4:
Input: [1,1,1,0,1]
Output: [false,false,false,false,false]
Note:
`1 <= A.length <= 30000`
`A[i]` is `0` or `1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether the binary number represented by each subarray from the input array `A` is divisible by 5, we need to understand a few key points:

1. **Binary Interpretation**: The binary number represented by a subarray from `A[0]` to `A[i]` is interpreted from most significant bit to least significant bit. For example, if `A = [1, 0, 1]`, `N_0 = 1` (binary `1`), `N_1 = 2` (binary `10`), and `N_2 = 5` (binary `101`).

2. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if the remainder when divided by 5 is zero. Thus, we need to check the remainder of each interpreted binary number.

3. **Iterative Building of Binary Number**: Instead of converting the entire subarray to a binary number each time, we can build the number iteratively. This is efficient and prevents overflow as we handle the bits one at a time.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: To check for divisibility by 5, we can use the property that:
   - If `num` is the current value represented by the binary number, then:
     \[
     \text{next\_num} = (num \times 2 + A[i]) \mod 5
     \]
   This will keep us within bounds and allows us to check the divisibility in a continuous manner.

Now let's implement this in Python for the LeetCode format.



```python
class Solution:
    def prefixesDivBy5(self, A: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        answer = []  # This will store the results
        current_num = 0  # This will hold the current value of the binary number mod 5
        
        for bit in A:
            # Update current_num by shifting left (multiply by 2) and adding the new bit
            current_num = (current_num * 2 + bit) % 5
            # Check if the current number is divisible by 5
            answer.append(current_num == 0)
        
        return answer

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with an empty list `answer` to store whether each `N_i` is divisible by 5, and `current_num` initialized to 0.

2. **Iteration Through the Array**: We loop through each element in the input array `A`. For each bit:
   - We update `current_num` using the formula mentioned above.
   - We append `True` to `answer` if `current_num` is 0 (indicating divisibility by 5), otherwise we append `False`.

3. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the `answer` list, which matches the expected output format.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input array `A`. We go through each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the result list `answer`.

This solution efficiently determines the required boolean values for any given binary input array within the constraints provided.
