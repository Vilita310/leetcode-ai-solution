# 383. Ransom Note

### Problem Description 
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.


Example 1:
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

Constraints:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if a ransom note can be constructed from the letters available in a magazine string, we can follow a straightforward approach involving frequency counting of characters.

Here's how we can break down the solution into steps:

1. **Count the Frequency of Letters**: We will count how many times each letter appears in both the ransom note and the magazine.
2. **Comparison**: For each character in the ransom note, we will check if the magazine has at least as many instances of that character.
3. **Return Result**: If all characters in the ransom note can be matched with those in the magazine with the required frequencies, we'll return true. If we find any character in the ransom note that cannot be matched, we return false.

We'll use Python's built-in `collections.Counter` which will allow us to easily count and compare the frequencies of letters in both strings.

Here’s the detailed code that you can directly run on LeetCode:



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        # Count the frequency of letters in the magazine
        magazine_count = Counter(magazine)
        
        # Count the frequency of letters in the ransom note
        ransom_note_count = Counter(ransomNote)
        
        # Check if each letter in the ransom note can be constructed from the magazine
        for letter in ransom_note_count:
            if ransom_note_count[letter] > magazine_count.get(letter, 0):
                return False
        
        return True

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Imports**:
   - We import `Counter` from the `collections` module, which is a convenient way to count occurrences of items in a collection.
   
2. **Class Definition**:
   - The problem statement is encapsulated within a class `Solution`.
   
3. **Method Definition**:
   - The `canConstruct` method takes two strings, `ransomNote` and `magazine`, as parameters.
   
4. **Counting Letters**:
   - `Counter(magazine)` creates a dictionary-like object where each character in the magazine is a key, and its value is the count of that character.
   - Similarly, `Counter(ransomNote)` does the same for the ransom note.
   
5. **Checking Counts**:
   - We iterate over each letter in the `ransom_note_count`.
   - For each letter, we check if its count in the ransom note exceeds its count in the magazine. The method `get(letter, 0)` returns the count in the magazine, defaulting to `0` if the letter is not found.
   - If `ransom_note_count[letter]` (needed count) is greater than `magazine_count.get(letter, 0)` (available count), we return `False`.
   
6. **Returning True**:
   - If we finish checking all letters in the ransom note without returning `False`, we return `True`, indicating the ransom note can indeed be constructed.

This code is efficient, working in linear time relative to the lengths of the input strings, making it suitable for competitive programming and platforms like LeetCode.

# 385. Mini Parser

### Problem Description 
Given a string s represents the serialization of a nested list, implement a parser to deserialize it and return the deserialized `NestedInteger`.

Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.


Example 1:
Input: s = "324"
Output: 324
Explanation: You should return a NestedInteger object which contains a single integer 324.


Example 2:
Input: s = "[123,[456,[789]]]"
Output: [123,[456,[789]]]
Explanation: Return a NestedInteger object containing a nested list with 2 elements:
1. An integer containing value 123.

2. A nested list containing two elements:
    i.  An integer containing value 456.

    ii. A nested list with one element:
         a. An integer containing value 789

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
`s` consists of digits, square brackets `"[]"`, negative sign `'-'`, and commas `','`.

`s` is the serialization of valid `NestedInteger`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of deserializing a string representation of a nested list into a `NestedInteger` object, we will define the `NestedInteger` class and implement a method to parse the string. The key steps to accomplish this task are as follows:

1. **Define the NestedInteger Class**: This class will have methods to handle single integers and nested lists.
2. **Parse the String**: We will use a stack to keep track of the current `NestedInteger` objects as we parse through the string.
3. **Handle Different Cases**: As we traverse the string, we need to handle digits, commas, brackets, and potentially negative signs.

Let's look at the implementation in Python:



```python
class NestedInteger:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize an empty nested list.
        """
        self._value = []

    def add(self, nestedInteger):
        """
        Add a nested integer to this nested list.
        """
        self._value.append(nestedInteger)

    def setInteger(self, value):
        """
        Set this NestedInteger to a single integer.
        """
        self._value = value

    def isInteger(self):
        """
        Return True if this NestedInteger holds a single integer, rather than a nested list.
        """
        return isinstance(self._value, int)

    def getInteger(self):
        """
        Return the single integer that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a single integer.
        Return None if this NestedInteger holds a nested list.
        """
        if self.isInteger():
            return self._value
        return None

    def getList(self):
        """
        Return the nested list that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a nested list.
        Return None if this NestedInteger holds a single integer.
        """
        if not self.isInteger():
            return self._value
        return None


class Solution:
    def deserialize(self, s: str) -> NestedInteger:
        """
        Given a string s representing a nested list, return the deserialized NestedInteger.
        """
        stack = []
        current = NestedInteger()
        num = ''
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            char = s[i]
            
            if char == '[':
                # Start a new list
                stack.append(current)
                current = NestedInteger()
            elif char == ']':
                # End of the current list
                if num:
                    current.add(NestedInteger().setInteger(int(num)))
                    num = ''
                last = stack.pop()
                last.add(current)
                current = last
            elif char == ',':
                # End of the current number
                if num:
                    current.add(NestedInteger().setInteger(int(num)))
                    num = ''
            else:
                # It's part of a number (digit or sign)
                num += char
            
            i += 1
        
        # If there's a number left at the end
        if num:
            current.add(NestedInteger().setInteger(int(num)))
        
        return current

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We define a `NestedInteger` class to store either a single integer or a list of nested integers.

2. **The `deserialize` Method**:
   - We maintain a stack (`stack`) to keep track of `NestedInteger` objects as we encounter nested lists.
   - The `current` variable points to the current `NestedInteger` being constructed.
   - We iterate through the string `s` using an index `i`.

3. **Parsing Logic**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If we encounter `[`, a new list starts. We push the `current` onto the stack and create a new `NestedInteger`.
     - If we encounter `]`, we finalize the current list. If there's a number being formed, we convert it to an integer and add it to the current list. We then pop from the stack and add the current list back to the last one.
     - If we encounter `,`, it's just a separator; if there’s a number being formed, we finalize it.
     - If the character is a digit or `-`, we continue building the number string.

4. **Finalizing the Current Number**:
   - At the end of the loop, if there's still a number to add, we finalize this before returning the `current`.

This approach efficiently constructs the nested structure using a linear scan through the string, ensuring correctness in nesting and hierarchy. It is designed to run within the constraints provided.

# 387. First Unique Character in a String

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, return the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 105`
`s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the first non-repeating character in a string and returning its index, we can utilize the following approach:

1. **Count Character Frequencies**: We'll create a dictionary (or a `collections.Counter`) to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

2. **Find the First Non-Repeating Character**: After counting the characters, we can iterate through the string again to find the first character with a count of 1 (indicating it is non-repeating). 

3. **Return the Index**: If we find such a character, we'll return its index. If no non-repeating character is found by the end of the search, we will return -1.

Now, let's implement this logic in Python, following the LeetCode solution format.



```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count occurrences of each character
        char_count = {}
        for char in s:
            if char in char_count:
                char_count[char] += 1
            else:
                char_count[char] = 1
        
        # Step 2: Find the first non-repeating character
        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if char_count[char] == 1:
                return index
        
        # Step 3: Return -1 if no non-repeating character exists
        return -1

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.firstUniqChar("leetcode"))  # Output: 0
# print(solution.firstUniqChar("loveleetcode"))  # Output: 2
# print(solution.firstUniqChar("aabb"))  # Output: -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: The code is wrapped in a class named `Solution`. This is a common requirement in LeetCode problems to encapsulate the solution.

2. **Method Definition**: Inside the `Solution` class, we define the method `firstUniqChar` which takes a single string argument `s`.

3. **Count Occurrences**:
   - We initialize a dictionary `char_count` to keep track of how many times each character appears in `s`.
   - We use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string. If the character is already in the dictionary, we increment its count; otherwise, we set its count to 1.

4. **Finding the First Non-Repeating Character**:
   - We enumerate through the characters in the string again to keep track of both the character and its index.
   - We check if the count of the character in the dictionary is 1. If it is, we return the current index.

5. **Return -1**: If we finish the loop without finding any non-repeating characters, we return -1.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice: once for counting and once for finding the non-repeating character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we count a fixed number of characters (lowercase English letters), which is constant.

This method is efficient and should work well within the provided constraints of the problem.

# 408. Valid Word Abbreviation

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty string `s` and an abbreviation `abbr`, return whether the string matches with the given abbreviation.

A string such as `"word"` contains only the following valid abbreviations:
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
Notice that only the above abbreviations are valid abbreviations of the string `"word"`. Any other string is not a valid abbreviation of `"word"`.

Note:
Assume `s` contains only lowercase letters and `abbr` contains only lowercase letters and digits.


Example 1:
Given s = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n":
Return true.


Example 2:
Given s = "apple", abbr = "a2e":
Return false.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of checking whether a string `s` matches a given abbreviation `abbr`, we need to process both `s` and `abbr` such that we accurately account for letters and skipped characters represented by numbers in `abbr`. 

Here's a step-by-step approach on how to implement this in Python to run effectively on the LeetCode platform:

1. **Initialization**: We will maintain an index for both `s` and `abbr`. The index for `s` (`i`) will help us track our position in the string, while the index for `abbr` (`j`) will do the same for the abbreviation.

2. **Processing the abbreviation**: As we iterate through `abbr`, we need to handle:
   - Letters: If we encounter a letter, we compare it against the current character in `s`. If they match, we move both indices forward. If not, the abbreviation does not match and we can return false.
   - Digits: A digit indicates that we are supposed to skip a certain number of characters in `s`. We need to parse the digit to determine how many characters to skip. If the digit is `k`, we will increase `i` by `k` characters.

3. **Final checks**: After processing both strings, both indices should reach the end of their respective strings for a successful match.

Here’s the succinct and well-structured Python implementation conforming to the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, s: str, abbr: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, 0  # Initialize two pointers for s and abbr
        n, m = len(s), len(abbr)  # Get the lengths of both strings

        while i < n and j < m:  # Iterate while there are characters in both s and abbr
            if abbr[j].isdigit():  # If the current character in abbr is a digit
                if abbr[j] == '0':  # Leading zeros are not allowed
                    return False
                    
                count = 0
                while j < m and abbr[j].isdigit():  # Extract the full number
                    count = count * 10 + int(abbr[j])
                    j += 1

                i += count  # Skip the characters in s according to the number

            else:  # Current character in abbr is a letter
                if i < n and s[i] == abbr[j]:  # Check if they match
                    i += 1  # Move forward in s
                else:
                    return False  # They do not match
                j += 1  # Move forward in abbr
        
        # If both indices have reached the end of their respective strings, it is a match
        return i == n and j == m

# Example Usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.validWordAbbreviation("internationalization", "i12iz4n"))  # Output: True
# print(solution.validWordAbbreviation("apple", "a2e"))  # Output: False

```

### Explanation:
- We initialize the two pointers `i` and `j` to zero, which will navigate through the string `s` and the abbreviation `abbr`, respectively.
- Our while loop runs until either pointer reaches the end of its respective string.
- Inside the loop:
  - If we come across a digit in `abbr`, we handle it by calculating the full number and incrementing the pointer for `s` accordingly.
  - For alphabetic characters, we compare them and increment both pointers only if there's a match.
- Finally, we check whether both pointers are at the end of their respective strings, confirming a successful match.

This algorithm runs in O(n + m) time complexity, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s` and `abbr`, respectively. The implementation checks for valid conditions and maintains clarity for future reference.

# 415. Add Strings

### Problem Description 
Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string.


Example 1:
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"

Example 2:
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"

Example 3:
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"

Constraints:
`1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104`
`num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.

`num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Follow up: Could you solve it without using any built-in `BigInteger` library or converting the inputs to integer directly?

### Solution 
 Certainly! The problem asks us to sum two non-negative integers represented as strings and return the result as a string without using built-in large integer types or conversions to integer directly. 

To solve this problem, we can simulate the addition process similar to how we would do it manually. We'll traverse both strings from the end to the beginning, just as we would with paper and pencil, handling carry as necessary.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Start from the least significant digit (the end of the strings), initialize variables for the result string and a carry which will hold any overflow greater than 10.
  
2. **Loop through digits**: Iterate through both strings while there's still a digit to process or there's a carry. 
    - Extract the current digit from `num1` and `num2`. If one string is shorter, treat its digit as 0.
    - Convert these string digits into integers and sum them along with the carry.
    - Calculate the new digit to append to the result and update the carry. The new digit is the sum modulo 10, and the carry is the sum divided by 10.
  
3. **Final adjustments**: After the loop, if there’s a carry remaining, append it to the result.

4. **Reverse the result**: Since we built the result from the least significant to the most significant digit, we need to reverse it before returning.

### Python Code

Here's how the algorithm can be implemented in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        # Initialize variables
        result = []
        carry = 0
        
        # Pointers for num1 and num2
        i, j = len(num1) - 1, len(num2) - 1
        
        # Loop until both strings are processed and no carry is left
        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            # Get the current digit from num1
            if i >= 0:
                carry += int(num1[i])
                i -= 1
            
            # Get the current digit from num2
            if j >= 0:
                carry += int(num2[j])
                j -= 1
            
            # Carry will be the tens place, result digit is the units place
            result.append(str(carry % 10))
            carry //= 10  # Get the carry for the next iteration
        
        # Join the result and reverse since we collected it in reverse order
        return ''.join(reversed(result))

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**: We're defining a class `Solution` with a method `addStrings` that takes two string parameters, `num1` and `num2`.
  
2. **Result and Carry Initialization**: We initialize a list called `result` to hold the digits of the sum and a variable `carry` to hold the overflow.

3. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are digits left in either number or there’s a carry.
   - We check if there are still digits to process in `num1` and `num2`, add them to `carry` if so, and move the respective pointer left.
  
4. **Appends**: For each iteration, we calculate the digit to append to `result` as `carry % 10`, and update `carry` using floor division by 10.

5. **Final Join and Reverse**: After constructing the list, we reverse the result since we collected it backwards and then join it into a string to return.

### Testing

You can run this code on LeetCode for the problem "Add Strings" by placing it in the provided coding area for the problem statement. The solution effectively meets the constraints and performs well for the input size specified in the problem description.

# 443. String Compression

### Problem Description 
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.

Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

Follow up:
Could you solve it using only `O(1)` extra space?

Example 1:
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".


Example 2:
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.


Example 3:
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".


Example 4:
Input: chars = ["a","a","a","b","b","a","a"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "aaa", "bb", and "aa". This compresses to "a3b2a2". Note that each group is independent even if two groups have the same character.


Constraints:
`1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
`chars[i]` is a lower-case English letter, upper-case English letter, digit, or symbol.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of compressing an array of characters according to the specified rules, we can follow a step-by-step approach. The key idea is to iterate through the character array, count the consecutive repeating characters, and modify the input array in place. 

Let's break down the steps and then implement the solution in the format expected by LeetCode:

### Steps to Solution:
1. **Initialization**: We'll use two pointers: one pointer (`write_index`) to keep track of where to write the compressed characters, and another pointer (`read_index`) to iterate through the input array.

2. **Counting Consecutive Characters**: For each character in the input array, we will count how many times it appears consecutively.

3. **Writing Compressed Data**: If a character appears only once, we write it directly to the `write_index`. If it appears multiple times, we write the character followed by its count to the array. If the count is 10 or more, we need to split it into individual digits.

4. **Return Length**: Finally, we return the length of the compressed parts of the array, which will be represented by the `write_index`.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        write_index = 0  # Index to write the compressed characters
        read_index = 0   # Index to read characters
        n = len(chars)   # Length of the input character array
        
        while read_index < n:
            current_char = chars[read_index]
            count = 0
            
            # Counting occurrences of current character
            while read_index < n and chars[read_index] == current_char:
                read_index += 1
                count += 1
            
            # Writing current character
            chars[write_index] = current_char
            write_index += 1
            
            # If count is greater than 1, we write the count in the array
            if count > 1:
                for digit in str(count):  # Split count into digits
                    chars[write_index] = digit
                    write_index += 1
        
        return write_index  # The new length of the compressed array

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Class and Method Definition**: The solution is encapsulated in a class `Solution` with a method `compress` that takes a list of characters as input.

2. **Pointer Initialization**: We initialize `write_index` to keep track of where we are writing the compressed characters and `read_index` to iterate through the characters.

3. **While Loop**: We loop until `read_index` is less than the length of the `chars` array. Inside the loop:
   - We save the current character and reset the count to zero.
   - A nested `while` loop counts how many times the current character repeats.

4. **Writing to the Array**: After closing the inner loop (which counts the repetitions), we write the current character to `chars` at the location pointed by `write_index`. Then, if the count is more than 1, we convert it to a string and write each digit back into `chars`.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the method returns `write_index`, which represents the length of the modified array.

This approach ensures that the original input array is modified in place with O(1) extra space complexity, as required in the problem statement.

# 459. Repeated Substring Pattern

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.


Example 2:
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 104`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 Certainly! The problem at hand is to determine whether a given string can be formed by repeating a substring multiple times. A string can be represented as multiple copies of a substring if and only if there is a substring that can be multiplied to recreate the entire string.

To solve this problem, we can utilize an efficient approach based on string manipulation. Here's the plan:

1. **Concatenate the string with itself**: By doing this, we create a string that includes all possible overlaps of the substring. 

2. **Remove the first and last character**: This helps us determine if the original string appears in this new concatenated string, excluding the trivial case where the string would just match itself at the end.

3. **Check for the original string**: If the original string can be found within this new modified string, then the string can indeed be formed by repeating a substring.

Here's how to implement this approach in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Create the concatenated string
        doubled_s = s + s
        
        # Step 2: Check if the original string appears in the modified string
        # but excluding the first and last characters.
        # The original string should start at index 1 and end before the last index.
        return s in doubled_s[1:-1]

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.repeatedSubstringPattern("abab"))  # Output: True
# print(solution.repeatedSubstringPattern("aba"))   # Output: False
# print(solution.repeatedSubstringPattern("abcabcabcabc"))  # Output: True

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` that meets the LeetCode structure.
  
2. **Method Definition**: We implement a method `repeatedSubstringPattern` which takes a string `s` as input.

3. **Doubling the String**: `doubled_s = s + s` creates a new string which is `s` appended to itself.

4. **Substring Check**: We check if the original string `s` exists in the subrange `doubled_s[1:-1]`, which effectively removes the first and last character from the concatenated string to avoid trivial matches.

5. **Return Boolean**: The function returns `True` if `s` is found in the modified string, indicating that `s` can be constructed by repeating a substring. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. The major operation is the substring search which can be done in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we are creating a new string that is twice the length of the input.

This method is efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for handling the constraints provided.

# 468. Validate IP Address

### Problem Description 
Given a string `IP`, return `"IPv4"` if IP is a valid IPv4 address, `"IPv6"` if IP is a valid IPv6 address or `"Neither"` if IP is not a correct IP of any type.

A valid IPv4 address is an IP in the form `"x1.x2.x3.x4"` where `0 <= xi <= 255` and `xi` cannot contain leading zeros. For example, `"192.168.1.1"` and `"192.168.1.0"` are valid IPv4 addresses but `"192.168.01.1"`, while `"192.168.1.00"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are invalid IPv4 addresses.

A valid IPv6 address is an IP in the form `"x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8"` where:
`1 <= xi.length <= 4`
`xi` is a hexadecimal string which may contain digits, lower-case English letter (`'a'` to `'f'`) and upper-case English letters (`'A'` to `'F'`).

Leading zeros are allowed in `xi`.

For example, "`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"` and "`2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"` are valid IPv6 addresses, while "`2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:037j:7334"` and "`02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"` are invalid IPv6 addresses.


Example 1:
Input: IP = "172.16.254.1"
Output: "IPv4"
Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".


Example 2:
Input: IP = "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"
Output: "IPv6"
Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".


Example 3:
Input: IP = "256.256.256.256"
Output: "Neither"
Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.


Example 4:
Input: IP = "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334:"
Output: "Neither"

Example 5:
Input: IP = "1e1.4.5.6"
Output: "Neither"

Constraints:
`IP` consists only of English letters, digits and the characters `'.'` and `':'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of identifying whether a given string is a valid IPv4 address, a valid IPv6 address, or neither, we can use the following approach:

### Steps to solve the problem:
1. **Check for IPv4 Validity:**
   - Split the string by the `.` character.
   - Confirm that there are exactly 4 sections.
   - For each section, ensure:
     - It is composed only of digits.
     - Convert the section to an integer and check if it lies within the range [0, 255].
     - Ensure there are no leading zeros for any section, except the section is exactly "0".

2. **Check for IPv6 Validity:**
   - Split the string by the `:` character.
   - Confirm that there are exactly 8 sections.
   - For each section, ensure:
     - Its length is between 1 and 4 characters.
     - It contains only valid hexadecimal characters (digits and 'a' to 'f' or 'A' to 'F').

3. **Decide the output:**
   - If the string fits the IPv4 criteria, return "IPv4".
   - If the string fits the IPv6 criteria, return "IPv6".
   - If neither, return "Neither".

### Python Code:
Here's how the implementation looks in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def validIPAddress(self, IP: str) -> str:
        # Helper function to validate IPv4 address 
        def is_valid_ipv4(ipv4):
            parts = ipv4.split('.')
            if len(parts) != 4:
                return False
            
            for part in parts:
                if not part.isdigit():  # Check if part is only digits
                    return False
                if len(part) == 0 or len(part) > 3:  # Check for empty or too long
                    return False
                if part[0] == '0' and len(part) > 1:  # Check leading zeros
                    return False
                if int(part) < 0 or int(part) > 255:  # Check range
                    return False
            
            return True

        # Helper function to validate IPv6 address 
        def is_valid_ipv6(ipv6):
            parts = ipv6.split(':')
            if len(parts) != 8:
                return False
            
            for part in parts:
                if len(part) < 1 or len(part) > 4:  # Length check
                    return False
                if not all(c in '0123456789abcdefABCDEF' for c in part):  # Hex check
                    return False
            
            return True

        # Determine if the IP is IPv4, IPv6 or Neither
        if '.' in IP:
            return "IPv4" if is_valid_ipv4(IP) else "Neither"
        elif ':' in IP:
            return "IPv6" if is_valid_ipv6(IP) else "Neither"
        else:
            return "Neither"

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` with a method `validIPAddress` that takes an IP string.
- Inside the method, we define two helper functions, one for validating IPv4 and another for IPv6.
- Each helper function checks the respective format and rules as outlined in our approach.
- We determine whether the input string contains a `.` or a `:` to decide whether we should validate it as IPv4 or IPv6.
- Finally, we return the appropriate string based on which validation check passes.

### How to use on LeetCode:
- This code can be directly copied and pasted into the LeetCode coding environment under the problem statement.
- Ensure the problem statement matches the provided function signature (`validIPAddress(self, IP: str) -> str`). 

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently determines the type of IP address input while ensuring all the specified rules are adhered to. It runs in linear time with respect to the length of the input string, making it suitable for this problem.

# 520. Detect Capital

### Problem Description 
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:
All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".

All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".

Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".

Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.


Example 1:
Input: "USA"
Output: True

Example 2:
Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of judging the usage of capitals in a word based on specified rules, we can break the solution down into clear steps. We need to check the three specified conditions:

1. All letters in the word are capitalized.
2. All letters in the word are in lowercase.
3. Only the first letter is capitalized, and the rest are lowercase.

We can leverage built-in string methods in Python to verify these conditions simply and efficiently. The `str.isupper()`, `str.islower()`, and `str.istitle()` methods will be particularly useful. The `str.istitle()` method checks if the first character is uppercase and all subsequent characters are lowercase.

Here's how the implementation can look:



```python
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        # Check if all characters are uppercase
        all_upper = word.isupper()
        # Check if all characters are lowercase
        all_lower = word.islower()
        # Check if the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase
        first_upper = word.istitle()
        
        # Return True if any of the three conditions is satisfied
        return all_upper or all_lower or first_upper

```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: We define a method `detectCapitalUse` which takes a single argument `word` (a string).

2. **Check Conditions**:
    - `word.isupper()`: This will return `True` if all characters in `word` are uppercase.
    - `word.islower()`: This will return `True` if all characters in `word` are lowercase.
    - `word.istitle()`: This will return `True` if the first character is uppercase and all subsequent characters are lowercase.

3. **Return Statement**: Finally, we check if any of the above conditions hold true using a logical OR operator (`or`) and return the result.

### Example Usage:

Here are a few example test cases to illustrate how our code behaves with input data.



```python
# Instantiate the solution class
solution = Solution()

# Test cases
print(solution.detectCapitalUse("USA"))    # Output: True
print(solution.detectCapitalUse("FlaG"))   # Output: False
print(solution.detectCapitalUse("leetcode")) # Output: True
print(solution.detectCapitalUse("Google"))  # Output: True
print(solution.detectCapitalUse("gOOd"))    # Output: False

```

This solution is efficient and runs in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input string, as each of the string methods will iterate through the string at most once. It also has O(1) space complexity since we're only using a few boolean flags.

# 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `a` and `b`, find the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them.

A subsequence of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`. For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"` because you can delete the underlined characters in `"aebdc"` to get `"abc"`. Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).

An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.

Return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between `a` and `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".

Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.


Example 2:
Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".


Example 3:
Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.


Constraints:
`1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
`a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between two strings `a` and `b`, we can make some observations about what constitutes an uncommon subsequence.

### Observations:
1. **Subsequence Definition**: A subsequence is derived by deleting some (or no) characters from a string. Thus, if two strings are identical, they share all subsequences.
2. **Uncommon Subsequence Definition**: An uncommon subsequence is one that exists in one string but not in the other.
3. **Length Check**: If both strings are identical, the answer is `-1` since all subsequences from one will also be in the other.
4. **Length Comparison**: If the strings differ, the longest uncommon subsequence will simply be the longer of the two strings. This is because the entirety of the longer string cannot be formed from the shorter string when they are not equal.

### Plan:
1. Compare strings `a` and `b`.
2. If they are equal, return `-1`.
3. If they are not equal, return the maximum of the lengths of the two strings.

### Implementation:
Let's implement the solution in Python, following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        # If both strings are the same, return -1
        if a == b:
            return -1
        # Return the length of the longer string
        return max(len(a), len(b))

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.findLUSlength("aba", "cdc"))  # Output: 3
# print(sol.findLUSlength("aaa", "bbb"))  # Output: 3
# print(sol.findLUSlength("aaa", "aaa"))  # Output: -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `Solution` class is defined with a method `findLUSlength`.
- Inside the method, we first check if strings `a` and `b` are equal. If they are, we return `-1` since they do not have any uncommon subsequences.
- If they differ, we then return the maximum of the lengths of `a` and `b`. This is because the longer string itself is an uncommon subsequence.
  
### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the longer string, due to the comparison of lengths and the equality check.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This solution is efficient and meets the constraints provided, working seamlessly for strings of length up to 100 characters.

# 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II

### Problem Description 
Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence among them. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.


Example 1:
Input: "aba", "cdc", "eae"
Output: 3
Note:
All the given strings' lengths will not exceed 10.

The length of the given list will be in the range of [2, 50].

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the longest uncommon subsequence among a list of strings, we can follow a systematic approach. The key observation here is that an uncommon subsequence is a string that is not a subsequence of any other string in the list.

Here's the step-by-step outline for the solution:

1. **Definition Recap**: For any string `s`, it is a subsequence of another string `t` if `s` can be obtained from `t` by deleting some characters without rearranging the remaining characters.

2. **Plan**:
   - We will find the maximum length of a string in the list that is not a subsequence of any other string in the list.
   - Start by considering each string and check if it is a subsequence of any other string.
   - If a string is not a subsequence of any other, we consider its length as a candidate for the longest uncommon subsequence.
   - The answer will be the longest such candidate found, or -1 if all strings are subsequences of each other.

3. **Equality Check**: Two strings are the same and thus trivially subsequences of each other. So we should also ensure that two strings must be different for one to be considered an uncommon subsequence.

Below is the Python code following the LeetCode solution format, including necessary imports and a method signature:



```python
class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        def is_subsequence(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
            it = iter(s2)
            return all(c in it for c in s1)

        max_length = -1  # Initialize to -1
        
        for i in range(len(strs)):
            # Assume current string is a valid uncommon subsequence
            is_uncommon = True
            
            for j in range(len(strs)):
                if i != j:
                    # If strs[i] is a subsequence of strs[j]
                    if is_subsequence(strs[i], strs[j]):
                        is_uncommon = False
                        break
            
            if is_uncommon:
                # Update max_length if the current string's length is greater
                max_length = max(max_length, len(strs[i]))
        
        return max_length

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` with a method `findLUSlength` which takes a list of strings `strs`.

2. **Helper Function**: 
   - `is_subsequence(s1, s2)` checks if `s1` is a subsequence of `s2` using an iterator approach that checks if all characters of `s1` can be found in `s2` in order.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - We initialize `max_length` to -1, which will hold our answer.
   - We loop through each string `strs[i]`, and for each string, check against all other strings `strs[j]`.
   - If we find that `strs[i]` is a subsequence of `strs[j]`, we mark it as not uncommon (`is_uncommon = False`).
   - If a string is deemed uncommon after checking, we update `max_length` with the maximum value between the current `max_length` and the length of the uncommon string.

4. **Return Statement**: After finishing the loops, we return `max_length`, which is the length of the longest uncommon subsequence or -1 if none exists.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- Strings that are the same will never count as uncommon.
- Strings of length 1 and 2.
- All strings being subsequences of others.

This solution efficiently finds the longest uncommon subsequence according to the problem's requirements. The complexity of checking subsequences ensures that we can handle the given constraints.

# 527. Word Abbreviation

### Problem Description 
Given an array of n distinct non-empty strings, you need to generate minimal possible abbreviations for every word following rules below.

Begin with the first character and then the number of characters abbreviated, which followed by the last character.

If there are any conflict, that is more than one words share the same abbreviation, a longer prefix is used instead of only the first character until making the map from word to abbreviation become unique. In other words, a final abbreviation cannot map to more than one original words.

 If the abbreviation doesn't make the word shorter, then keep it as original.


Example:
Input: ["like", "god", "internal", "me", "internet", "interval", "intension", "face", "intrusion"]
Output: ["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]
Note:
 Both n and the length of each word will not exceed 400.

 The length of each word is greater than 1.

 The words consist of lowercase English letters only.

 The return answers should be in the same order as the original array.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of generating minimal abbreviations for an array of distinct non-empty strings, we will follow the specified rules to ensure that each abbreviation is unique while observing the constraints given.

### Approach:
1. **Generate Initial Abbreviations**: For each word, generate an initial abbreviation using the first character, the number of characters that are abbreviated, and the last character.
2. **Check for Conflicts**: Check if the generated abbreviations conflict with one another. If a conflict occurs, we will incrementally increase the prefix length of the conflicting abbreviation.
3. **Select the Best Abbreviation**: For each abbreviation, we must ensure that it is shorter than the original word. If it is not, we will retain the original word.

### Detailed Steps:
- Start by defining a function to generate an abbreviation for a word based on an abbreviation length.
- Use a loop to check for conflicts between abbreviations. If any conflicts arise, increment the prefix length until the abbreviations become unique.
- Keep track of the best abbreviation or the original word if it doesn't make the word shorter.
- Finally, compile the list of unique, valid abbreviations and return it.

Here’s how the implementation would look:



```python
class Solution:
    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words):
        n = len(words)
        abbreviations = []
        unique_abbr = {}
        
        # Function to generate abbreviation
        def generate_abbr(word, prefix_length):
            if len(word) - prefix_length <= 2:
                return word  # If abbreviation doesn't make it shorter, return the original
            return word[:prefix_length] + str(len(word) - prefix_length - 1) + word[-1]

        # Try to generate abbreviations for each word
        for word in words:
            abbr = generate_abbr(word, 1)
            abbreviations.append(abbr)

        # Conflict resolution
        while True:
            # Count abbreviations for conflicts
            unique_abbr = {}
            conflicts = False

            for i, abbr in enumerate(abbreviations):
                if abbr in unique_abbr:
                    unique_abbr[abbr].append(i)
                    conflicts = True
                else:
                    unique_abbr[abbr] = [i]

            # If no conflicts, break loop
            if not conflicts:
                break

            # Resolve conflicts by incrementing prefix length
            new_abbrs = []
            for i, abbr in enumerate(abbreviations):
                if len(unique_abbr[abbr]) > 1:
                    # The abbreviation had conflicts; increase the prefix length
                    prefix_length = abbr.count(unique_abbr[abbr][0]) - 2  # Get the original prefix length
                    new_abbr = generate_abbr(words[i], prefix_length + 1)  # Increment prefix length
                    new_abbrs.append(new_abbr)
                else:
                    new_abbrs.append(abbr)

            abbreviations = new_abbrs
            
        return [generate_abbr(word, 1) if len(abbreviations[i]) >= len(word) else abbreviations[i] for i, word in enumerate(words)]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define our solution inside a class named `Solution` which is a common practice on platforms like LeetCode.
2. **Generate Abbreviation Function**: This auxiliary function helps create an abbreviation based on the prefix length. If the abbreviation is not shorter, it returns the original word.
3. **Loop Until No Conflicts**: We repeatedly check for conflicts in the current list of abbreviations. If conflicts are found, we increase the length of the prefix for the conflicting entries.
4. **Final Output**: After resolving all conflicts, the final list of abbreviations is returned, ensuring that for each word, its representation is either unique or the original word itself if abbreviation isn’t advantageous.

This implementation efficiently generates the required abbreviations while adhering to the constraints of the problem, making it suitable for execution in a LeetCode session.

# 536. Construct Binary Tree from String

### Problem Description 
You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.


Example 1:
Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5]

Example 2:
Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5,7]

Example 3:
Input: s = "-4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [-4,2,6,3,1,5,7]

Constraints:
`0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
`s` consists of digits, `'('`, `')'`, and `'-'` only.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of constructing a binary tree from a string representation and returning its level-order traversal, we can break the problem down into two main tasks:

1. Parse the input string to construct the binary tree.
2. Perform a level-order traversal (BFS) to return the desired output format.

Here’s how we can implement this solution in Python, ensuring it conforms to the LeetCode solution format.

### Step 1: Define the TreeNode Class
We'll first create a TreeNode class to represent each node in the binary tree.

### Step 2: Build the Tree from String
We'll write a helper function that will parse the string and construct the binary tree recursively.

### Step 3: Perform Level-Order Traversal
We'll define a method to perform a level-order traversal of the tree and return the output as a list.

### Final Code Implementation
Here's the complete implementation:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def str2tree(self, s: str) -> TreeNode:
        
        # Helper function to parse string and construct the tree
        def parse(s, index):
            if index >= len(s):
                return None, index
            
            # Read the number (could be negative)
            start = index
            if s[index] == '-':
                index += 1
            
            while index < len(s) and s[index].isdigit():
                index += 1
                
            root_val = int(s[start:index])  # Convert to integer
            root = TreeNode(root_val)
            
            # If there are left and/or right subtrees
            if index < len(s) and s[index] == '(':
                index += 1  # Skip '('
                root.left, index = parse(s, index)  # Parse left subtree
                index += 1  # Skip ')'
            
            if index < len(s) and s[index] == '(':
                index += 1  # Skip '('
                root.right, index = parse(s, index)  # Parse right subtree
                index += 1  # Skip ')'
            
            return root, index
        
        # Parse the string starting from index 0
        root, _ = parse(s, 0)
        return root

    def levelOrder(self, root: TreeNode) -> list:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        result = []
        queue = [root]
        
        while queue:
            current_level = []
            next_queue = []
            for node in queue:
                current_level.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    next_queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    next_queue.append(node.right)
            result.extend(current_level)
            queue = next_queue
            
        return result

    # Final function to integrate both parts
    def treeFromString(self, s: str) -> list:
        root = self.str2tree(s)
        return self.levelOrder(root)

# Example Usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.treeFromString("4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"))  # Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **TreeNode Class**: Represents a single node in the binary tree, holding a value and pointers to left and right children.
  
2. **str2tree Method**:
   - The `parse` nested function recursively constructs the binary tree by interpreting the string. It reads an integer and constructs a `TreeNode`. If the next characters are '(', it recursively processes the left and then the right subtree.
   - Each time a number is read, we also handle the possibility of negative numbers.
     
3. **levelOrder Method**:
   - This method takes the root of the binary tree and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to collect the node values level by level.
   - It uses a queue to facilitate the level-order traversal and collects values into a result list.

4. **treeFromString Method**:
   - This is the high-level function to read the string, construct the binary tree, and return its level order traversal.

You can test the solution by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling `treeFromString` with the input string. The output will match the expected level-order representation of the binary tree.

# 537. Complex Number Multiplication

### Problem Description 
Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.


Example 1:
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.


Example 2:
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

Note:
The input strings will not have extra blank.

The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of multiplying two complex numbers, we will follow these steps:

1. **Parse the input strings** representing the complex numbers to extract the real and imaginary parts.
2. **Multiply the complex numbers** using the formula:
   - If \( z_1 = a + bi \) and \( z_2 = c + di \), then:
     \[
     z_1 \times z_2 = (a \times c - b \times d) + (a \times d + b \times c)i
     \]
3. **Format the output string** to ensure it's in the standard form \( a+bi \).

### Detailed Code Explanation

- We'll define a function `complexNumberMultiply` that takes two strings as input.
- We will parse each string to separate the real and imaginary parts.
- Using the multiplication formula, we'll calculate the new real and imaginary parts.
- Finally, we'll return the result in the required format.

Here is the complete code in Python that follows the format used in LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def complexNumberMultiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        # Helper function to parse a complex number from the string format
        def parse_complex(num: str):
            # Find the index of the '+' or '-' which separates real and imaginary parts
            plus_index = num.find('+', 1)
            if plus_index == -1:  # if not found, it must be '-'
                plus_index = num.find('-', 1)
            
            # Extract real and imaginary parts
            real = int(num[:plus_index])  # before '+' or '-' is the real part
            imaginary = int(num[plus_index:-1])  # after '+' or '-' and before 'i' is the imaginary part
            return real, imaginary
        
        # Parse both complex numbers
        a, b = parse_complex(num1)
        c, d = parse_complex(num2)
        
        # Multiply using the formula
        real_result = a * c - b * d
        imaginary_result = a * d + b * c
        
        # Format the result in string format
        return f"{real_result}+{imaginary_result}i"

# Example of usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.complexNumberMultiply("1+1i", "1+1i"))  # Output: "0+2i"
print(solution.complexNumberMultiply("1+-1i", "1+-1i"))  # Output: "0+-2i"

```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: The `Solution` class contains our method for multiplication.
2. **Parse Function**: A helper function `parse_complex`:
   - It finds the index of '+' or '-' to separate the real and imaginary parts, ensuring to look starting from the second character (ignoring the sign at position 0).
   - It extracts and converts these parts into integers.
   
3. **Extracting Components**: The method retrieves the real and imaginary parts of both complex numbers by calling `parse_complex`.
   
4. **Multiplication Logic**: It computes the product using the formula described earlier.
   
5. **Returning Result**: Finally, it constructs the result string in the appropriate format and returns it.

This code handles the parsing of complex numbers and performs the multiplication correctly according to the defined rules, making it suitable for submission on LeetCode.

# 539. Minimum Time Difference

### Problem Description 
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.


Example 1:
Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`2 <= timePoints <= 2 * 104`
`timePoints[i]` is in the format "HH:MM".

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum minutes difference between any two time points given in a "HH:MM" format, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: First, we need to convert each time point from "HH:MM" format to the total number of minutes since midnight. This can be calculated as `HH * 60 + MM`.

2. **Sort the Time Points**: Once we have converted the times into minutes, we can sort this list of minutes. Sorting helps to easily find the minimum difference between consecutive time points.

3. **Calculate Differences**: After sorting, we compute the difference between each consecutive pair of time points. Since time is cyclical (i.e., after "23:59", it goes to "00:00"), we also need to consider the difference between the last time point and the first time point in the sorted list, adjusted for the 24-hour wraparound.

4. **Find the Minimum Difference**: We will keep track of the minimum difference found during the iteration.

Here's the implementation of the above steps in Python:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Convert time points into minutes
        minutes = []
        for time in timePoints:
            hh, mm = map(int, time.split(':'))
            total_minutes = hh * 60 + mm
            minutes.append(total_minutes)

        # Step 2: Sort the list of minutes
        minutes.sort()
        
        # Step 3: Calculate minimum differences
        min_diff = float('inf')  # Start with a large value
        n = len(minutes)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1]
            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
        
        # Step 4: Check the wrap-around difference
        wrap_around_diff = (minutes[0] + 1440) - minutes[-1]  # 1440 = 24 * 60
        min_diff = min(min_diff, wrap_around_diff)
        
        return min_diff

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input and Output**: The function `findMinDifference` accepts a list of time strings in the "HH:MM" format and returns an integer representing the minimum minute difference.

2. **Conversion of Time**: The loop iterates through each time point, splits it into hours (`hh`) and minutes (`mm`), and converts it into total minutes since midnight.

3. **Sorting**: We sort the list of total minutes to ensure time points are in chronological order.

4. **Calculating Differences**: We loop through the sorted list, calculating the difference between each pair of consecutive times and updating our `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found.

5. **Wrap-Around Calculation**: Additionally, we check the difference between the first time point (after sorting) and the last time point, taking into account the 24-hour cycle by adding `1440` minutes.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the minimum difference found.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of time points.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the converted minute values.

This code is crafted to be directly runnable on the LeetCode website, complete with appropriate definitions and type hints.

# 541. Reverse String II

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and left the other as original.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 104`
`s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

`1 <= k <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of reversing the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters in the string `s`, we can break it down into logical steps. The task requires us to iterate through the string in chunks of `2k`, reverse the first `k` characters of each chunk, and leave the remainder of the characters as they are. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Iterate through the string**: We will loop through the string in steps of `2k`, effectively dividing the string into chunks of size `2k`.

2. **Reverse the first `k` characters**: For each chunk, we will reverse the first `k` characters if they are available. If there are fewer than `k` characters left in that part of the string, we will reverse whatever is left.

3. **Handle the remaining characters**: After reversing the first `k` characters, we will leave the next `k` characters as they are.

4. **Concatenate the results**: Finally, we will concatenate the processed chunks back into a single string to get the required output.

Here's the detailed implementation in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Convert the string to a list of characters for mutable operations
        s_list = list(s)
        n = len(s_list)
        
        # Iterate through the string in chunks of 2k
        for i in range(0, n, 2 * k):
            # Determine the end index for the current k characters
            end = min(i + k, n)  # We reverse only up to the length of the string
            
            # Reverse the first k characters
            s_list[i:end] = reversed(s_list[i:end])
        
        # Return the joined list as a new string
        return ''.join(s_list)

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Convert the string to a list**: Since strings in Python are immutable, we first convert the input string into a list of characters to allow mutable operations.

2. **Calculate the length**: We calculate the length of the string (`n`) to control our loop.

3. **Loop through the string**: We loop through the string in increments of `2k` using `range(0, n, 2 * k)`. This gives us the starting index for each chunk of size `2k`.

4. **Determine the end index**: For each segment starting at index `i`, we calculate the `end` index as `min(i + k, n)`. This ensures that we do not try to reverse more characters than are present in the string.

5. **Reverse the first `k` characters**: We utilize Python's list slicing and the `reversed` method to reverse the first `k` characters efficiently.

6. **Join the list back to a string**: After processing all chunks, we use `''.join(s_list)` to convert the list of characters back into a string and return it as the result.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we are traversing the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the list of characters.

### Example Usage:

Here’s how you would use the `Solution` class to solve the examples provided:



```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
print(solution.reverseStr("abcd", 2))      # Output: "bacd"

```

This format aligns with the requirements to be runnable in a LeetCode environment.

# 544. Output Contest Matches

### Problem Description 
During the NBA playoffs, we always arrange the rather strong team to play with the rather weak team, like make the rank 1 team play with the rank nth team, which is a good strategy to make the contest more interesting. Now, you're given n teams, you need to output their final contest matches in the form of a string.

The n teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.


Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: (1,2)
Explanation: 
Initially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.

Then we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.


Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: ((1,4),(2,3))
Explanation: 
In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.

And we got (1,4),(2,3).

In the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.

And we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).


Example 3:
Input: 8
Output: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Explanation: 
First round: (1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)
Second round: ((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))
Third round: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Since the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).

Note:
The n is in range [2, 212].

We ensure that the input n can be converted into the form 2k, where k is a positive integer.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of generating the final contest matches for the given NBA playoff structure, we will use a recursive approach. The key idea is to understand that in each round, the strongest remaining team is paired with the weakest remaining team, and this process continues until all teams are paired and we can represent the results in a nested format using parentheses.

The pairing operates on the following principles:
1. In each pairing round, the strongest team is paired with the weakest team. For example, with teams ranked from 1 to `n`, team `1` is paired with team `n`, team `2` with team `n-1`, and so on.
2. After the first round of pairings, the winners of these contests need to be paired again, which introduces additional layers of parentheses.

Given the problem constraints, `n` will always be a power of 2, making our recursive pairing straightforward.

### Solution Steps

1. **Recursive Function**: We will define a recursive function that generates the string representation of the teams for a given range (`start` to `end`).
2. **Base Case**: If there is only one pair (i.e., start equals end), return the representation of that single pair.
3. **Recursive Case**: For a general case:
   - Pair the strongest team from the start with the weakest team from the end.
   - Recursively generate the pairs for the two halves of the teams.
4. **Output Formatting**: Format the output string according to the required structure with parentheses and commas.

### Python Code

Here's how the solution can be implemented in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def generateContestMatches(self, n: int) -> str:
        def helper(start: int, end: int) -> str:
            if start == end:  # Base case: single team
                return str(start)
            # Pair the strongest and weakest
            left = helper(start, end - 1)  # Recursive call for the left half
            right = helper(start + 1, end)  # Recursive call for the right half
            return f'({left},{end})' if start == 1 else f'({left},{right})'

        return helper(1, n)

# Testing the function
solution = Solution()
print(solution.generateContestMatches(2))  # Output: (1,2)
print(solution.generateContestMatches(4))  # Output: ((1,4),(2,3))
print(solution.generateContestMatches(8))  # Output: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))

```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Class and Function Definition**: We define a class `Solution` and a method `generateContestMatches()`, which takes an integer `n` as input.
2. **Helper Function**: Inside `generateContestMatches()`, we define a nested `helper` function that constructs the contest matches recursively. It takes two parameters:
   - `start`: The starting team rank.
   - `end`: The ending team rank.
3. **Base Case**: When `start` equals `end`, we reach a base condition where there is only one team. We return its string representation.
4. **Recursive Pairing**:
   - We pair the weakest (`end`) with the strongest (`start`).
   - We recursively calculate the matches for the lower and upper halves of the teams.
5. **String Formatting**: The generated strings for matches are wrapped in parentheses in the format `(left_pair,right_pair)`.
6. **Final Call**: The final result is returned by calling `helper` with the full range from `1` to `n`.

This code can be run directly on the LeetCode platform, adhering to its format and conventions.

# 551. Student Attendance Record I

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:
`'A'`: Absent.

`'L'`: Late.

`'P'`: Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
The student was absent (`'A'`) for strictly fewer than 2 days total.

The student was never late (`'L'`) for 3 or more consecutive days.

Return `true` if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or `false` otherwise.


Example 1:
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.


Example 2:
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 1000`
`s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'L'`, or `'P'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if a student is eligible for an attendance award based on their attendance record string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count Absences**: We will iterate through the string to count the number of days the student was marked as absent ('A').
2. **Check Late Days**: During the same pass, we will also check for consecutive late days ('L'). We can maintain a counter for consecutive late days and reset it whenever we encounter a 'P' or 'A'.
3. **Evaluate Conditions**: After the iteration, we will check if the total number of absences is less than 2, and ensure that we never encountered 3 or more consecutive late days.

Here’s the implementation of the above logic in Python, formatted to be compatible with LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize counters for absences and late days
        absences = 0
        late_days = 0
        
        # Loop through each character in the attendance record
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == 'A':
                absences += 1
            if s[i] == 'L':
                late_days += 1
                # If there are 3 consecutive 'L's, return False immediately
                if late_days == 3:
                    return False
            else:
                # Reset late days counter if the current character is 'P' or 'A'
                late_days = 0
            
            # Early exit if criteria for absences is not met
            if absences >= 2:
                return False
        
        # After scanning the entire string, check the absence criteria
        return absences < 2

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.checkRecord("PPALLP"))  # Output: True
# print(sol.checkRecord("PPALLL"))  # Output: False

```

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Initialization**:
  - We start with two counters: `absences`, initialized to 0 to track the number of 'A' in the string, and `late_days`, initialized to 0 to track consecutive 'L'.
  
- **Iterate through the string**:
  - For each character in the string, check:
    - If it is 'A', increment the `absences` counter.
    - If it is 'L', increment the `late_days` counter.
      - If `late_days` reaches 3, we immediately return `False` as the student has been late for three consecutive days.
    - If the character is 'P', reset the `late_days` counter to 0, since the sequence of late days has been broken.
    
- **Early Exit**:
  - While iterating, if at any point the `absences` counter is 2 or more, we return `False` right away since the award criteria for absences is already violated.
  
- **Final Check**:
  - After processing the full string, we finally check if `absences` is less than 2. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that the student is eligible for the attendance award.

This approach gives us a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, and ensures we efficiently validate the conditions without needing additional iterations.

# 553. Optimal Division

### Problem Description 
Given a list of positive integers, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.


Example:
Input: [1000,100,10,2]
Output: "1000/(100/10/2)"
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in "1000/((100/10)/2)" are redundant, since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return "1000/(100/10/2)". 
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2
Note:
The length of the input array is [1, 10].

Elements in the given array will be in range [2, 1000].

There is only one optimal division for each test case.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the float division of a list of positive integers by strategically placing parentheses, we need to understand how division works and how the order of operations can affect the result.

In division, the result of division is affected greatly by how the numbers are grouped. The key insight here is:
1. To maximize the division operation, we want to keep the larger numbers in the numerator and minimize the impact of the smaller numbers in the denominator.
2. As a specific observation, when we have more than two elements, putting the first element in the numerator and wrapping the rest in a single parenthesis to form a division will yield maximum results.

### Approach:
1. If the length of the input list is 1, the answer is just the number itself as a string.
2. If the length is 2, return the division of the two numbers in the required format.
3. For more than two numbers, we can represent the expression by putting the first number as the numerator and the rest in one composite division.

### Step-by-step Example:
For the input `[1000, 100, 10, 2]`:
- The best way to group the divisions is to calculate `1000 / (100 / 10 / 2)`.
- This implies that we first calculate `100 / 10 / 2` and then divide `1000` by that.

### Implementation:
The implementation will consist of dynamically creating the expression as a string and returning it alongside being formatted correctly.

Here's how we can code this solution:



```python
def optimalDivision(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    if n == 1:
        return str(nums[0])
    
    if n == 2:
        return f"{nums[0]}/{nums[1]}"
    
    # More than 2 numbers
    # Create the optimal expression
    # The first part is simply nums[0]
    # The rest part is wrapped in parenthesis with a division
    numerator = str(nums[0])
    denominator = '/'.join(map(str, nums[1:]))
    
    return f"{numerator}/({denominator})"

# Example usage:
# result = optimalDivision([1000, 100, 10, 2])
# print(result)  # Should print "1000/(100/10/2)"

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: We first check the length of the input list `nums`.
   - If `n == 1`, we return the single number as a string.
   - If `n == 2`, we format and return the string as `"{first_number}/{second_number}"`.
2. **Constructing the Expression**:
   - For more than two numbers:
     - The first number `nums[0]` is kept as is.
     - For the rest of the numbers, we join them with a division operator `/` which creates a string for the denominator.
     - The denominator is then wrapped in parentheses.
3. **Output**: We return the constructed expression.

This method ensures that we maximize the division while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement. The solution runs in O(n) time complexity due to the string operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

# 555. Split Concatenated Strings

### Problem Description 
Given a list of strings, you could concatenate these strings together into a loop, where for each string you could choose to reverse it or not. Among all the possible loops, you need to find the lexicographically biggest string after cutting the loop, which will make the looped string into a regular one.

Specifically, to find the lexicographically biggest string, you need to experience two phases: 
Concatenate all the strings into a loop, where you can reverse some strings or not and connect them in the same order as given.

Cut and make one breakpoint in any place of the loop, which will make the looped string into a regular one starting from the character at the cutpoint. 
And your job is to find the lexicographically biggest one among all the possible regular strings.


Example:
Input: "abc", "xyz"
Output: "zyxcba"
Explanation: You can get the looped string "-abcxyz-", "-abczyx-", "-cbaxyz-", "-cbazyx-", where '-' represents the looped status. The answer string came from the fourth looped one, where you could cut from the middle character 'a' and get "zyxcba".

Note:
The input strings will only contain lowercase letters.

The total length of all the strings will not over 1,000.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lexicographically largest string after forming a loop from a list of strings and potentially reversing them, we can follow a systematic approach. The general idea is to create all possible combinations of the provided strings and their reversals, form a loop, and then determine the lexicographically largest substring after 'cutting' the loop at different positions.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Generate All Possible Combinations**:
    - For each string in the input list, we will consider both the original string and its reverse.

2. **Form a Loop and Concatenate**:
    - Concatenate all combinations of the strings together to form a "looped" string.

3. **Cutting the Loop**:
    - Since the loop is continuous, cutting it at any character gives us different starting points for evaluating substrings.

4. **Find the Lexicographic Maximum**:
    - For each starting point derived from the looped string, we extract the substring and keep track of the maximum lexicographical string.

### Implementation:
The following Python implementation follows the steps described above:



```python
class Solution:
    def largestLexicographical(self, strs):
        # Step 1: Generate all possible combinations of the input strings
        combinations = []
        n = len(strs)

        # Generate all combinations using original and reversed strings
        for i in range(1 << n):  # 2^n combinations
            curr = []
            for j in range(n):
                if (i & (1 << j)) > 0:  # If j-th bit is set, use reverse
                    curr.append(strs[j][::-1])
                else:  # Use original
                    curr.append(strs[j])
            combinations.append(''.join(curr))
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the maximum string to an empty string
        max_string = ""
        
        # Step 3: For each combination, find the maximal cut string
        for combo in combinations:
            # Create a looped string
            looped_string = combo + combo # Concate to simulate the loop by duplicating
            
            # Check all possible cuts from 0 to length of original string
            for start in range(len(combo)):
                # Create the substring from start index
                candidate = looped_string[start:start + len(combo)]
                # Update max_string if candidate is lexicographically larger
                if candidate > max_string:
                    max_string = candidate
        
        return max_string

```

### Explanation:

- **Bit Manipulation**: We generate all combinations by using a bitmask where each bit determines whether to use the original string or its reversed version.
  
- **Doubling the String**: By appending the combination string to itself (e.g., `combo + combo`), we can easily access all cuts by taking substrings starting from every index.

- **Max String Update**: We maintain a `max_string` variable that stores the lexicographically largest string found while iterating through the possible cuts.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n * m), where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average length of the strings. This arises from generating all combinations of strings (2^n) and then checking all cuts (up to m).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^n) for storing the combinations of strings.

This implementation achieves the desired result following the specific problem requirements and is formatted to run on LeetCode or similar platforms.

# 556. Next Greater Element III

### Problem Description 
Given a positive integer `n`, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer `n` and is greater in value than `n`. If no such positive integer exists, return `-1`.

Note that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 21

Example 2:
Input: n = 21
Output: -1

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the smallest integer greater than a given positive integer `n` that has the same digits as `n`, we'll follow a step-by-step method. This problem can be approached using concepts similar to finding the next permutation of a sequence. 

Here's the solution in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Convert integer to a list of digits
        digits = list(str(n))
        
        # Step 1: Find the first decreasing element from the right
        i = len(digits) - 2
        while i >= 0 and digits[i] >= digits[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        
        if i == -1:
            return -1  # No bigger number can be formed
        
        # Step 2: Find the element just larger than digits[i]
        j = len(digits) - 1
        while digits[j] <= digits[i]:
            j -= 1
        
        # Step 3: Swap digits[i] and digits[j]
        digits[i], digits[j] = digits[j], digits[i]
        
        # Step 4: Reverse the sequence from i + 1 to end to get the smallest number
        digits[i + 1:] = reversed(digits[i + 1:])
        
        # Convert back to integer
        result = int(''.join(digits))
        
        # Check if the result fits in 32-bit integer
        if result <= 2**31 - 1:
            return result
        else:
            return -1

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.nextGreaterElement(12))  # Output: 21
print(solution.nextGreaterElement(21))  # Output: -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Convert Integer to List of Digits**: 
   - We convert the integer `n` into a string and then into a list of its digits to enable easy manipulation.

2. **Find the First Decreasing Element from Right**: 
   - We start from the second last digit and move to the left to find the first digit that is smaller than the digit next to it. This index is stored in `i`.
   - If no such index exists (i.e., we reach the beginning of the list), it means the digits are in descending order, and thus, no greater permutation is possible. We return `-1`.

3. **Find the Element Just Larger than digits[i]**: 
   - We look for the smallest digit to the right of `digits[i]` that is larger than `digits[i]`. We store its index in `j`.

4. **Swap the Digits**: 
   - We swap the digits at indices `i` and `j` to increase the number.

5. **Reverse the Sequence After i**: 
   - To form the smallest possible number, we reverse all the digits to the right of index `i`. This guarantees we get the next greater number, which is formed by the smallest sequence following the newly swapped digit.

6. **Check Valid Results**: 
   - We convert the newly formed list back to an integer. If this integer exceeds `2**31 - 1`, we return `-1` since it doesn't fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

# 557. Reverse Words in a String III

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.


Example 1:
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

Example 2:
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
`s` contains printable ASCII characters.

`s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.

There is at least one word in `s`.

All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of reversing the characters in each word of a given string while maintaining the order of the words and spaces, we can follow a systematic approach. The outline of the solution is as follows:

1. **Split the String**: We will split the original string `s` into a list of words using the space character as a delimiter.
2. **Reverse Each Word**: We will iterate through the list of words and reverse each word individually.
3. **Join Words**: Finally, we will join the reversed words back into a single string with spaces in between.

Let's write the Python code to implement this logic.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Split the string by spaces to get individual words
        words = s.split(' ')
        
        # Reverse each word in the list
        reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
        
        # Join the reversed words back to a single string with spaces
        return ' '.join(reversed_words)

```

### Explanation

1. **Splitting the String**: 
   - We use the `split(' ')` method on the string `s`. This will break the string into a list of words based on spaces. For the input "Let's take LeetCode contest", `words` will be `["Let's", "take", "LeetCode", "contest"]`.

2. **Reversing Each Word**:
   - We use a list comprehension to reverse each word in the list. The slicing method `word[::-1]` is employed to reverse the characters of the word. For instance, 

        - The word "Let's" will become "s'teL"
        - The word "take" will become "ekat"
        - The word "LeetCode" will become "edoCteeL"
        - The word "contest" will become "tsetnoc"
      
   At the end of this step, `reversed_words` becomes `["s'teL", "ekat", "edoCteeL", "tsetnoc"]`.

3. **Joining Words**:
   - Finally, we use `' '.join(reversed_words)` to concatenate all elements of the `reversed_words` list into a single string with a space character in between. The resulting string will be "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc".

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are processing each character in the string when splitting and reversing.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the words and the final result.

This solution is efficient and utilizes Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities effectively, making it easy to read and understand. It can be directly run on LeetCode as it follows the required format.

# 564. Find the Closest Palindrome

### Problem Description 
Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. 
The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.


Example 1:
Input: "123"
Output: "121"
Note:
The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.

If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.

### Solution 
 Certainly! Let’s break down the problem of finding the closest palindromic integer to a given positive integer \( n \), represented as a string.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Palindrome**: A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 121, 1221).
2. **Closest Integer**: We need to find the closest palindrome to the integer \( n \) that is not equal to \( n \) itself. If there are two equally distant palindromes, we should return the smaller one.
3. **Input Constraints**: The input is a positive integer as a string and its length will not exceed 18, meaning it can represent large numbers.

### Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize the following steps:

1. **Generate Candidate Palindromes**: 
   - We need to generate potential palindrome candidates derived from the number \( n \). We can create palindromes by manipulating the first half of the input number and mirroring it.
   - For a number of length \( L \):
     - Use the first \(\lceil \frac{L}{2} \rceil\) digits and mirror them to create:
       - A base palindrome.
       - Smaller and larger variations of this palindrome.

2. **Specific Cases**:
   - Handle edge cases like:
     - Small palindromes (e.g., 1).
     - Just below or above powers of ten (like 999 and 1000).
     
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculate the absolute difference between \( n \) and each candidate.
   - Select the closest palindrome, ensuring to check which is smaller in case of a tie.

### Complete Code

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python, following the LeetCode's format:



```python
class Solution:
    def nearestPalindrome(self, n: str) -> str:
        length = len(n)
        candidates = set()
        
        # Add lower and upper bound edge cases
        candidates.add(str(10**length + 1))  # 1000 -> 1001
        candidates.add(str(10**(length - 1) - 1))  # 1000 -> 999
        
        # Generate candidates based on the first half of the number
        prefix = int(n[:(length + 1) // 2])  # Get the first half
        
        for i in [-1, 0, 1]:
            new_prefix = str(prefix + i)
            if length % 2 == 0:
                candidates.add(new_prefix + new_prefix[::-1])  # Even length palindrome
            else:
                candidates.add(new_prefix + new_prefix[:-1][::-1])  # Odd length palindrome
        
        # Remove the original number itself to meet the requirement
        candidates.discard(n)
        
        # Find the closest palindrome
        min_diff = float('inf')
        closest_palindrome = None
        
        for candidate in candidates:
            diff = abs(int(candidate) - int(n))
            # Keeping the closest palindrome, consider smaller one in case of ties
            if (diff < min_diff or 
                (diff == min_diff and int(candidate) < int(closest_palindrome))):
                min_diff = diff
                closest_palindrome = candidate
        
        return closest_palindrome

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Candidate Generation**:
   - We create candidates by using prefixes and consider integer manipulations around it.
   - We ensure to check palindrome properties based on even/odd lengths of \( n \).

2. **Remove \( n \)**: 
   - We explicitly remove \( n \) from our set of candidates since the problem states that we need the closest palindromic integer not equal to \( n \).

3. **Finding the Closest**:
   - Iterate over all candidates, calculating the absolute difference to find the closest one and keeping track of the minimum difference observed.

4. **Complexity**: 
   - The solution works in linear time relative to the number of candidate checks, and candidate generation is efficient due to the limited nature of palindrome-producing manipulations.

You can now copy this code and run it directly on the LeetCode platform, ensuring it follows the expected format and logic as described.

# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of steps required to make `word1` and `word2` the same.

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.


Example 1:
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".


Example 2:
Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
`word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of steps required to make two strings `word1` and `word2` the same by deleting characters, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS). 

### Explanation:

The general idea is to find the length of the LCS between the two strings. The length of the LCS gives us insight into how many characters are aligned between the two strings without needing additional deletions. The formula to compute the minimum number of deletions required to transform both strings into their LCS is as follows:

- Let `len1` be the length of `word1` and `len2` be the length of `word2`.
- Let `lcs_length` be the length of the longest common subsequence of `word1` and `word2`.
- Then the number of deletions required is given by:
  
  \[
  \text{min_steps} = (len1 - lcs_length) + (len2 - lcs_length)
  \]

The reason for this formula is that:
- You need to delete all characters in `word1` that are not in the LCS.
- Similarly, you also need to delete all characters in `word2` that are not in the LCS.

### Steps to Implement:

1. Create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of LCS of the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`.
2. Iterate through both strings to fill in this DP table based on LCS rules:
   - If characters match, increment the count from the previous indices.
   - If they do not match, take the maximum value from the left or above in the DP table.
3. Compute the minimum deletions using the provided formula.

### Python Code:

Below is the Python code for this problem that can be run directly on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        len1, len2 = len(word1), len(word2)

        # Create a 2D DP array with (len1+1) x (len2+1)
        dp = [[0] * (len2 + 1) for _ in range(len1 + 1)]
        
        # Build the DP array
        for i in range(1, len1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, len2 + 1):
                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:  # Match
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:  # No match
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        # Length of Longest Common Subsequence
        lcs_length = dp[len1][len2]

        # Calculate the minimum number of deletions required
        min_steps = (len1 - lcs_length) + (len2 - lcs_length)

        return min_steps

```

### Summary:

The provided code solution initializes a 2D DP table to compute the LCS length, then uses this length to calculate the minimum number of deletions needed to make the two strings identical. The time complexity of this approach is O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, making it efficient for the given problem constraints.

# 591. Tag Validator

### Problem Description 
Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:
The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.

A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.

A valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.

A valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.

A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.

A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).

The cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. 
`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. 

Valid Code Examples:
Input: "<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>"
Output: True
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.

So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Input: "<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>"
Output: True
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.

start_tag -> "<DIV>"
end_tag -> "</DIV>"
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.

text1 -> ">>  ![cdata[]] "
cdata -> "<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>", where the CDATA_CONTENT is "<div>]>"
text2 -> "]]>>]"
The reason why start_tag is NOT "<DIV>>>" is because of the rule 6.

The reason why cdata is NOT "<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>" is because of the rule 7.


Invalid Code Examples:
Input: "<A>  <B> </A>   </B>"
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If "<A>" is closed, then "<B>" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input: "<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>"
Output: False
Input: "<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>"
Output: False
Input: "<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>"
Output: False
Input: "<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>"
Output: False
Input: "<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>"
Output: False
Note:
For simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain `letters`, `digits`, `'<'`,`'>'`,`'/'`,`'!'`,`'['`,`']'` and `' '`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of validating a code snippet with tags according to the specified rules, we can break down the solution into manageable parts. The main components we need to handle are parsing the input to isolate tags and their contents, validating the TAG_NAME rules, and checking proper nesting of tags. 

We will use a stack to manage the opening tags and check for correct closing tags. Additionally, careful regex operations will allow us to extract tags, CDATA sections, and plain text efficiently.

Here’s the complete Python code to implement this solution:



```python
import re

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, code: str) -> bool:
        # Regular expressions to find tags and CDATA sections
        tag_regex = re.compile(r'</?([A-Z]{1,9})\s*?>')
        cdata_regex = re.compile(r'<!\[CDATA\[(.*?)\]\]>')
        
        stack = []
        i = 0
        length = len(code)

        while i < length:
            # Check for CDATA section
            cdata_match = cdata_regex.match(code, i)
            if cdata_match:
                i += len(cdata_match.group(0))  # Move past the CDATA section
                continue

            # Check for tags
            tag_match = tag_regex.match(code, i)
            if tag_match:
                tag_name = tag_match.group(1)
                if code[tag_match.start()] == '/':  # This is a closing tag
                    if not stack or stack[-1] != tag_name:
                        return False  # Unmatched tag
                    stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening tag
                else:  # This is an opening tag
                    stack.append(tag_name)
                i += len(tag_match.group(0))
            else:
                # Check for any unmatched '<' or invalid tag structure
                if code[i] == '<':
                    return False  # Unmatched < found
                # Move to the next character
                i += 1

        # For the code to be valid, the stack must be empty at the end
        return len(stack) == 0

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Regular Expressions**: 
   - We define `tag_regex` to match both opening (`<TAG_NAME>`) and closing (`</TAG_NAME>`) tags. The tag name must consist of uppercase letters and have a length between 1 and 9.
   - `cdata_regex` is defined to find CDATA sections, which will ignore their content.

2. **Stack Initialization**: 
   - We use a list called `stack` to keep track of opened tags. This is essential for validating closing tags.

3. **Iterating through the String**:
   - We parse through the string `code` using a while loop until we reach its length.
   
4. **Handling CDATA**:
   - If we find a CDATA section, we skip over it as its content is ignored in terms of parsing tags.

5. **Handling Tags**:
   - If a tag is matched, we check whether it is opening or closing. 
   - If it’s closing (`</TAG_NAME>`), we verify it matches the last opened tag (the top of the stack).
   - If it’s opening (`<TAG_NAME>`), we simply push the TAG_NAME onto the stack.

6. **Error Checking**:
   - If we encounter an unmatched opening tag or a misplaced '<', we immediately return `False`.

7. **Final Validation**:
   - Once we finish parsing, the stack should be empty if all tags are properly closed. Thus, we return `True` if the stack is empty, otherwise `False`.

### Conclusion:
This approach ensures that the tag validation adheres strictly to the defined rules and effectively handles various edge cases. The use of a stack here is key to validating nested structures, allowing us to manage tags in a FIFO manner. The regex efficiently allows easy identification of tags and CDATA sections in the input string.

# 606. Construct String from Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".


Example 2:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of constructing a string representation of a binary tree using pre-order traversal, we'll follow a recursive approach. The goal is to generate the required string format while omitting unnecessary empty parentheses that do not affect the mapping relationship.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Defining the Tree Node Structure**: We'll use a standard class for the binary tree's node, which includes the value of the node and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **Recursive Function**: We'll define a recursive function that constructs the string representation. The function will:
   - Base case: If the current node is `None`, return an empty string.
   - If the current node exists,
     - Start with the node's value.
     - If the node has a left child, recursively process the left child and append it to the string.
     - For the right child:
       - If there is a left child, we must include parentheses for the right child even if it is `None`, so we recursively call for the right child and append it wrapped in parentheses.
       - If there is no left child, it means we need to include an empty pair of parentheses if this node has a right child (to maintain the structure).

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the constructed string.

### Python Code:

Here’s the complete code in the format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def tree2str(self, root: TreeNode) -> str:
        # Helper function to construct the string representation
        def construct_string(node):
            if not node:
                return ""
            
            # Start with the node's value
            res = str(node.val)
            
            # Check left child
            if node.left or node.right:  # If there's a child, include parentheses for it
                res += "(" + construct_string(node.left) + ")"
                
            # Check right child
            if node.right:  # Only add right child string if it exists
                res += "(" + construct_string(node.right) + ")"
                
            return res
        
        # Start from the root of the tree
        return construct_string(root)

# The following lines can be used to test the function
# Constructing binary tree for example input [1,2,3,4]
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)

# Creating an instance of Solution to use the method
sol = Solution()
output = sol.tree2str(root)  # Expected: "1(2(4))(3)"
print(output)

# Constructing binary tree for example input [1,2,3,null,4]
root2 = TreeNode(1)
root2.left = TreeNode(2)
root2.right = TreeNode(3)
root2.left.right = TreeNode(4)

output2 = sol.tree2str(root2)  # Expected: "1(2()(4))(3)"
print(output2)

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **TreeNode class**: This defines the structure of the binary tree node.
- **Solution class**: Contains the method `tree2str` which constructs the output string from the binary tree.
- **construct_string function**: This private helper function performs the actual recursive traversal while building the formatted string according to the rules specified.
- **Base Cases**: It handles the case where the node is `None` by returning an empty string. 
- **Recursion for Children**: The function checks if the left child exists and appends its representation in parentheses. The right child is processed similarly, but only if it exists and according to whether the left child was present to maintain the right structure.

This code will run directly on LeetCode under the constraints specified and provides the required output format.

# 609. Find Duplicate File in System

### Problem Description 
Given a list `paths` of directory info, including the directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, return all the duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths. You may return the answer in any order.

A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the same content.

A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:
`"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"`
It means there are `n` files `(f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt)` with content `(f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content)` respectively in the directory "`root/d1/d2/.../dm"`. Note that `n >= 1` and `m >= 0`. If `m = 0`, it means the directory is just the root directory.

The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:
`"directory_path/file_name.txt"`

Example 1:
Input: paths = ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)","root 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output: [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

Example 2:
Input: paths = ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output: [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

Constraints:
`1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104`
`1 <= paths[i].length <= 3000`
`1 <= sum(paths[i].length) <= 5 * 105`
`paths[i]` consist of English letters, digits, `'/'`, `'.'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.

You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.

You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. A single blank space separates the directory path and file info.

Follow up:
Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory-consuming part of it? How to optimize?
How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding duplicate files based on their content given a list of directory paths, we can follow these steps:

1. **Parse the Input:** Each entry in the input list contains a directory path followed by a list of files with their contents. We'll split this entry to extract the directory path and the files with their contents.

2. **Group by Content:** We'll use a dictionary to map file content to a list of file paths. The key will be the file content, and the value will be a list of paths that have that content.

3. **Identify Duplicates:** After populating the dictionary, we will filter out the entries that have more than one file path associated with the same content.

4. **Prepare Output:** Finally, we will format the list of duplicates according to the given specifications.

Here’s how you can implement this in Python, following the format required for LeetCode:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, paths: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        content_to_paths = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Iterate through each directory information string in paths
        for path in paths:
            parts = path.split(' ')  # Split the string by spaces
            directory = parts[0]     # The first part is the directory
            # Iterate through files in the directory
            for file_info in parts[1:]:
                filename_content = file_info.split('(')  # Split filename and its content
                filename = filename_content[0]  # Get the filename
                content = filename_content[1][:-1]  # Get the content, removing the closing parenthesis
                
                # Create the full file path
                full_path = f"{directory}/{filename}"
                
                # Map the content to the full file path
                content_to_paths[content].append(full_path)
        
        # Filter out and gather only the paths with duplicate content
        duplicates = [paths for paths in content_to_paths.values() if len(paths) > 1]
        
        return duplicates

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
output1 = solution.findDuplicate(["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)","root 4.txt(efgh)"])
output2 = solution.findDuplicate(["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)"])
print(output1)  # Expected [["root/a/2.txt", "root/c/d/4.txt", "root/4.txt"], ["root/a/1.txt", "root/c/3.txt"]]
print(output2)  # Expected [["root/a/2.txt", "root/c/d/4.txt"], ["root/a/1.txt", "root/c/3.txt"]]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Dictionary Setup:** We use `defaultdict` of lists to store paths by their content. This makes it easier to append paths directly.

2. **Processing Each Path:**
   - We split each string into components: the directory and the files.
   - For each file, we split the filename from its content using `split('(')`. This isolates the filename and its content clearly.
   - We remove the closing parenthesis from the content and concatenate the directory with the filename to form a full path.

3. **Identifying Duplicates:** After populating the dictionary, we create a list of paths where there are duplicates (i.e., content appearing more than once).

4. **Return Format:** The result is in the required format—lists of duplicate file paths grouped by their content.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the total number of files processed. This is because we need to read each file info once to populate the dictionary, and then we iterate over the dictionary to filter duplicates.
- **Space Complexity:** O(M), where M is the total unique file content found. This is due to storing paths corresponding to unique contents.

### Follow-ups:
- If we were working with a real file system or with large files, we would potentially use a hashing technique to manage content comparisons rather than loading everything into memory at once. This would minimize memory usage by only storing hashes of file content rather than the contents themselves.
- For partial reading (like chunking), we would read files in small pieces and build a unique hash incrementally, ensuring minimal memory load while still allowing content comparison. The most time-consuming part in this case would likely be the I/O operations associated with reading from disk, while the hashing process would need optimization to handle chunking efficiently.

# 616. Add Bold Tag in String

### Problem Description 
Given a string s and a list of strings dict, you need to add a closed pair of bold tag `<b>` and `</b>` to wrap the substrings in s that exist in dict. If two such substrings overlap, you need to wrap them together by only one pair of closed bold tag. Also, if two substrings wrapped by bold tags are consecutive, you need to combine them.


Example 1:
Input: 
s = "abcxyz123"
dict = ["abc","123"]
Output:
"<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"

Example 2:
Input: 
s = "aaabbcc"
dict = ["aaa","aab","bc"]
Output:
"<b>aaabbc</b>c"

Constraints:
The given dict won't contain duplicates, and its length won't exceed 100.

All the strings in input have length in range [1, 1000].

Note: This question is the same as 758: https://leetcode.com/problems/bold-words-in-string/

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of adding bold tags to substrings found in a given string, we will follow these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: The function will take a string `s` and a list of strings `dict` (the words we need to bold).

2. **Boolean Array Creation**: We will create a boolean array `bold` that will keep track of which characters in `s` should be bolded. Each index in this array corresponds to each character in `s`. If a substring (word from `dict`) starts at that index and is found in `s`, its corresponding indices in the `bold` array will be set to `True`.

3. **Walking through the String and Updating Bold Array**: For each word in `dict`, we'll check if it appears in `s`, and if it does, we'll update the bold array for the indices that the word covers.

4. **Building the Result String**: Finally, we will traverse the string `s`, and using the `bold` array, we'll construct the result by adding `<b>` tags where `bold` is `True` and ensuring no overlapping or consecutive bold tags.

5. **Return the Result**: The formatted string will be returned.

Here is the implementation of the above steps in Python, structured to work with the LeetCode environment:



```python
class Solution:
    def boldWords(self, dict: List[str], s: str) -> str:
        # Length of the input string
        n = len(s)
        # Create a bold array initialized to False
        bold = [False] * n
        
        # Mark the characters to be bolded
        for word in dict:
            start = 0
            while True:
                # Find next occurrence of the word starting from index 'start'
                start = s.find(word, start)
                if start == -1:
                    break  # No more occurrences found
                # Mark each character in the range of the found word as True
                for i in range(start, start + len(word)):
                    bold[i] = True
                # Move start forward to continue searching
                start += 1
        
        # Build the result string with bold tags
        result = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            # If we find the start of a bold section
            if bold[i]:
                result.append("<b>")
                # Add all characters that are in the bold range
                while i < n and bold[i]:
                    result.append(s[i])
                    i += 1
                result.append("</b>")
            else:
                # If it's not bold, just add the character
                result.append(s[i])
                i += 1
        
        # Join the result list into a single string and return
        return ''.join(result)

# Example Usage
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.boldWords(["abc","123"], "abcxyz123"))  # Output: "<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"
# print(sol.boldWords(["aaa","aab","bc"], "aaabbcc"))  # Output: "<b>aaabbc</b>c"

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We create a boolean array `bold` of the same length as `s` initialized to `False`.

2. **Search and Mark**: For each word in `dict`, we repeatedly search for its occurrence in the string `s` using the `str.find()` method. For each occurrence found, we mark the corresponding indices in the `bold` array as `True`.

3. **Constructing Output**: We build the output by iterating over the string `s`. Each time we encounter a `True` in the `bold` array, we start adding `<b>` tags and continue adding characters until we find a `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution addresses the overlaps by using the same `bold` array to determine contiguous bold regions.

This solution runs with a time complexity of approximately O(n * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the total length of all words in the dictionary since searching through the string might take time proportional to n for each word. The approach is efficient given the constraints of the problem.

# 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists

### Problem Description 
You have `k` lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

We define the range `[a, b]` is smaller than range `[c, d]` if `b - a < d - c` or `a < c` if `b - a == d - c`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].

List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].

List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].


Example 2:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: [1,1]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [[10,10],[11,11]]
Output: [10,11]

Example 4:
Input: nums = [[10],[11]]
Output: [10,11]

Example 5:
Input: nums = [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]]
Output: [1,7]

Constraints:
`nums.length == k`
`1 <= k <= 3500`
`1 <= nums[i].length <= 50`
`-105 <= nums[i][j] <= 105`
`nums[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists of sorted integers, we can utilize a combination of a min-heap (or priority queue) and a sliding window approach.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - We will use a min-heap to efficiently get the minimum element from the current set of elements from each list. Along with it, we'll also keep track of the maximum element in the current range. This helps in calculating the range quickly.

2. **Process**:
   - First, we push the first element of each list into the min-heap along with the index of the list and the index of the element in that list.
   - We keep track of the maximum number encountered so far while filling the heap.
   - We extract the minimum element from the heap and calculate the current range (using the maximum seen so far). If this range is smaller than the best known range, we update our results.
   - Next, we attempt to add the next element from the list represented by the minimum element we just removed from the heap. If the list has more elements, we push the next element onto the heap and update the maximum if necessary.
   - We repeat these steps until we cannot extract an element from any list (i.e., we have exhausted one of the lists).

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The process terminates once we run out of at least one list (meaning one list has no more elements to add). At that point, we would have found the smallest range that includes at least one number from each list.

### LeetCode Solution Format

Let's implement this logic in Python code that can be run on the LeetCode website.



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def smallestRange(self, nums):
        # Create a min-heap
        min_heap = []
        current_max = float('-inf')
        
        # Initialize the heap with the first element of each list
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums[i][0], i, 0))  # (value, list_index, element_index)
            current_max = max(current_max, nums[i][0])
        
        # Initialize the best range
        best_range = float('-inf'), float('inf')
        
        # Start processing the heap
        while min_heap:
            current_min, list_index, element_index = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # Update the smallest range if a smaller range is found
            if current_max - current_min < best_range[1] - best_range[0]:
                best_range = (current_min, current_max)
                
            # If the current list has more elements, add the next element to the heap
            if element_index + 1 < len(nums[list_index]):
                next_value = nums[list_index][element_index + 1]
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (next_value, list_index, element_index + 1))
                current_max = max(current_max, next_value)
            else:
                # If we reach the end of any list, we cannot continue further.
                break
                
        return list(best_range)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.smallestRange([[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]))  # Output: [20,24]

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by importing `heapq` for our min-heap operations.
- The class `Solution` contains the method `smallestRange` which executes our algorithm.
- We initialize our min-heap and the maximum value. We fill the heap with the first element of each list and keep track of the current maximum.
- We loop to process the heap until we can't push more elements (any list runs out).
- The range is updated whenever we find a new smaller range, and finally, we return it as a list.

This implementation effectively finds the smallest range in `O(N log K)` time complexity, where `N` is the total number of elements across all lists and `K` is the number of lists. This approach efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem description.

# 635. Design Log Storage System

### Problem Description 
You are given several logs, where each log contains a unique ID and timestamp. Timestamp is a string that has the following format: `Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second`, for example, `2017:01:01:23:59:59`. All domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Implement the `LogSystem` class:
`LogSystem()` Initializes the `LogSystem` object.

`void put(int id, string timestamp)` Stores the given log `(id, timestamp)` in your storage system.

`int[] retrieve(string start, string end, string granularity)` Returns the IDs of the logs whose timestamps are within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive. `start` and `end` all have the same format as `timestamp`, and `granularity` means how precise the range should be (i.e. to the exact `Day`, `Minute`, etc.). For example, `start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59"`, `end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59"`, and `granularity = "Day"` means that we need to find the logs within the inclusive range from Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd 2017, and the `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second` for each log entry can be ignored.


Example 1:
Input
["LogSystem", "put", "put", "put", "retrieve", "retrieve"]
[[], [1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59"], [2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59"], [3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00"], ["2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year"], ["2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour"]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, [3, 2, 1], [2, 1]]
Explanation
LogSystem logSystem = new LogSystem();
logSystem.put(1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59");
logSystem.put(2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59");
logSystem.put(3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00");
// return [3,2,1], because you need to return all logs between 2016 and 2017.

logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year");
// return [2,1], because you need to return all logs between Jan. 1, 2016 01:XX:XX and Jan. 1, 2017 23:XX:XX.

// Log 3 is not returned because Jan. 1, 2016 00:00:00 comes before the start of the range.

logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour");

Constraints:
`1 <= id <= 500`
`2000 <= Year <= 2017`
`1 <= Month <= 12`
`1 <= Day <= 31`
`0 <= Hour <= 23`
`0 <= Minute, Second <= 59`
`granularity` is one of the values `["Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Minute", "Second"]`.

At most `500` calls will be made to `put` and `retrieve`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of implementing the `LogSystem` class, we will take the following steps:

1. **Class Initialization**: In the `__init__` method, initialize a dictionary to store the logs with IDs as keys and timestamps as values.

2. **Storing Logs**: In the `put` method, we'll add logs in the form of (ID, timestamp) as entries in our dictionary.

3. **Retrieving Logs**: In the `retrieve` method, we'll need to:
   - Determine which part of the timestamp to consider based on the specified granularity (e.g., Year, Month, Day).
   - Construct the start and end ranges based on that granularity.
   - Filter the logs to find those whose timestamps fall within the inclusive range of start and end.

We'll use string slicing to manage timestamps based on the granularity and convert them to a comparable format when filtering.

Here is the complete implementation following the LeetCode format:



```python
class LogSystem:

    def __init__(self):
        self.logs = {}
        self.granularity_map = {
            "Year": 4,
            "Month": 7,
            "Day": 10,
            "Hour": 13,
            "Minute": 16,
            "Second": 19
        }

    def put(self, id: int, timestamp: str) -> None:
        self.logs[id] = timestamp

    def retrieve(self, start: str, end: str, granularity: str) -> List[int]:
        # Determine the length based on the granularity
        end_index = self.granularity_map[granularity]
        
        # Construct the truncated version of start and end for comparison
        start_truncated = start[:end_index] + (':' * (19 - end_index))
        end_truncated = end[:end_index] + (':' * (19 - end_index))
        
        result = []
        # Check logs to see if they fall within the specified range
        for id, timestamp in self.logs.items():
            if start_truncated <= timestamp <= end_truncated:
                result.append(id)
        
        return result

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**: We create a dictionary `logs` to keep the log entries. A mapping table `granularity_map` is defined to convert the granularity types to their corresponding index lengths.

2. **Adding Logs (`put`)**: We simply store the timestamp in our dictionary with the ID as the key.

3. **Retrieving Logs (`retrieve`)**:
   - We first find the index slice for truncating the timestamps based on the specified granularity.
   - `start_truncated` and `end_truncated` are built by taking the relevant parts of the `start` and `end` strings and padding the rest with colons to preserve the string length.
   - We then check each log's timestamp: if it lies within the specified range, we add it to the results list.
   - Finally, we return the results list of IDs.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for `retrieve`, where `n` is the number of logs since we are checking each log.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the logs.

This implementation adheres to LeetCode's constraints and should work efficiently given the problem's limits.

# 647. Palindromic Substrings

### Problem Description 
Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.


Example 1:
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".


Example 2:
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Note:
The input string length won't exceed 1000.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting palindromic substrings in a given string, we can utilize a technique called "expansion around centers". This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided (input string length won't exceed 1000). 

### Explanation

A palindromic substring reads the same backward as forward. For example, "aba" is a palindrome, but "abc" is not. 

To check all possible palindromic substrings, we can consider each character (and each pair of characters) in the string as potential "centers" of palindromes. 

1. **Single Character Center**: A palindrome can be centered around a single character. For example, in the string "aba", 'a' and 'b' are centers.
  
2. **Double Character Center**: A palindrome can also be centered between two characters. For example, "aa" is a palindrome and positioned between two 'a's.

By expanding around these centers, we can count all palindromic substrings. For each center, we'll check how far we can expand while keeping the substring a palindrome.

### Steps to Implement the Algorithm
1. Iterate through each character in the string. Treat each character as a potential center.
2. Expand outwards from that center and count all palindromes.
3. Repeat the process for each gap between characters, treating it as a potential center for even-length palindromes.

### Implementation

Here’s how the implementation would look following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        def expandAroundCenter(left: int, right: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            
            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
                count += 1  # We found a palindromic substring
                left -= 1   # Expand to the left
                right += 1  # Expand to the right
            
            return count
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Count palindromes of odd length (single character center)
            total_count += expandAroundCenter(i, i)
            # Count palindromes of even length (two-character center)
            total_count += expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)
        
        return total_count

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` as required by LeetCode.
2. **Method Definition**: We implement the method `countSubstrings` which accepts a string `s`.
3. **Expand Function**: The `expandAroundCenter` function checks for palindromes by expanding outward from the given indices `left` and `right`. It continues as long as the characters at these indices are equal, incrementing the count of palindromic substrings.
4. **Loop Through String**: We use a loop to go through each character (`i`) in the string to count both odd-length and even-length palindromic substrings using our `expandAroundCenter` function.
5. **Return Count**: Finally, we return the total count of palindromic substrings found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. Each expansion could potentially go through the entire string, and we have at most 2n centers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space apart from the input string.

This solution is efficient for the problem requirements and should run successfully for any valid input string within the constraints.

# 657. Robot Return to Origin

### Problem Description 
There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.


Example 1:
Input: moves = "UD"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.


Example 2:
Input: moves = "LL"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.


Example 3:
Input: moves = "RRDD"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: moves = "LDRRLRUULR"
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= moves.length <= 2 * 104`
`moves` only contains the characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'` and `'R'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether a robot returns to its starting position (0, 0) after executing a series of moves represented by a string, we can use the following approach:

### Problem Breakdown

1. The robot starts at the origin (0, 0).
2. Each move affects the robot's position:
   - 'U' (Up) increases the y-coordinate by 1.
   - 'D' (Down) decreases the y-coordinate by 1.
   - 'L' (Left) decreases the x-coordinate by 1.
   - 'R' (Right) increases the x-coordinate by 1.
3. To determine if the robot returns to the origin, we can keep track of the x and y coordinates and check if both are back to zero after all moves.

### Implementation Steps

1. Initialize the coordinates `(x, y)` to `(0, 0)`.
2. Iterate over each move in the string.
3. Update the coordinates based on the move.
4. After processing all moves, check if both `x` and `y` are zero.
5. Return `True` if both coordinates are zero; otherwise, return `False`.

### Python Code

Here is the Python code following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize coordinates
        x, y = 0, 0
        
        # Process each move
        for move in moves:
            if move == 'U':
                y += 1
            elif move == 'D':
                y -= 1
            elif move == 'L':
                x -= 1
            elif move == 'R':
                x += 1
        
        # Check if we are back at the origin (0, 0)
        return x == 0 and y == 0

```

### Explanation of the Code

- The `Solution` class defines the method `judgeCircle`.
- We initialize `x` and `y` to zero to represent the starting position.
- We loop through each character in the `moves` string and adjust the `x` and `y` based on the defined moves:
  - Increment `y` for 'U' (up).
  - Decrement `y` for 'D' (down).
  - Decrement `x` for 'L' (left).
  - Increment `x` for 'R' (right).
- After processing all moves, we check if both `x` and `y` are zero.
- Finally, we return `True` if the robot is at the origin (0, 0), indicating it returned to the starting position after all moves.

### Testing the Code

You can run this code in a LeetCode environment by creating a new problem submission and copying the code as provided above. It adheres to the expected input and output format of LeetCode problems. 

This solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string `moves`, making it efficient for the problem constraints.

# 678. Valid Parenthesis String

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'` and `'*'`, return `true` if `s` is valid.

The following rules define a valid string:
Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.

Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.

Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.

`'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string `""`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "(*)"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(*))"
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 100`
`s[i]` is `'('`, `')'` or `'*'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if a string containing parentheses and asterisks is valid, we can utilize a counting approach to keep track of the balance of parentheses while flexibly interpreting the asterisks. 

Here's a breakdown of how we might approach this:

### Problem Analysis
1. **Character Types**:
   - Left parenthesis `'('` increases the need for a closing parenthesis.
   - Right parenthesis `')'` decreases the openness.
   - An asterisk `'*'` can serve as either `'('`, `')'`, or be ignored (treated as empty).

2. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - At no point should the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening parentheses.
   - In the end, the total number of opening parentheses (considering the flexibility of asterisks) must equal the total number of closing parentheses.

### Strategy
We will maintain two counts:
- `low` represents the minimum number of open parentheses we might have, treating all asterisks as `')'`.
- `high` represents the maximum number of open parentheses, treating all asterisks as `'('`.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 0.
2. Traverse each character in the string:
   - If it's `'('`, increment both `low` and `high`.
   - If it's `')'`, decrement `low` and `high`.
   - If it's `'*'`, decrement `low` (treating as `')'`), and increment `high` (treating as `'('`).
   
3. After processing each character, if `high` becomes negative, it means we have an excess of closing parentheses, and we return `false`.
4. Ensure that `low` doesn’t drop below zero, since a negative `low` would indicate unbalanced parentheses.

5. Finally, validate the final counts: a string can be valid if `low` is zero (or if we can adjust it with asterisks).

### Code Implementation
Here's the implementation of the above logic in Python structured in a LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        low = 0  # minimum possible open parentheses
        high = 0  # maximum possible open parentheses
        
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                low += 1
                high += 1
            elif char == ')':
                low -= 1
                high -= 1
            elif char == '*':
                low -= 1  # '*' as ')'
                high += 1  # '*' as '('
            
            # The number of ')' cannot exceed the number of '('
            if high < 0:
                return False
            
            # `low` cannot go negative, as it would imply more ')' than we can counteract
            low = max(low, 0)
        
        # After processing all characters, `low` being 0 means everything balanced out
        return low == 0

```

### Explanation of Code:
- We iterate through each character of the string `s`.
- For each character, we adjust `low` and `high` counts based on its type.
- If we ever find that `high` goes negative, it indicates an excess of closing parentheses, and we return `False`.
- At the end, we check if `low` is equal to zero, which means we have a valid balance of parentheses considering the flexibility of asterisks.

### Usage
This code can be directly used in the LeetCode environment by copying and pasting it into the provided code editor for the problem statement.

# 680. Valid Palindrome II

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty string `s`, you may delete at most one character.  Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.


Example 1:
Input: "aba"
Output: True

Example 2:
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.

Note:
The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z.

The maximum length of the string is 50000.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if a given string can be turned into a palindrome by deleting at most one character, we can utilize a two-pointer technique. This technique will help us efficiently check for palindrome properties, while allowing us to adjust our checking mechanism when we encounter mismatched characters.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding Palindromes**:
   A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "aba" is a palindrome, but "abc" is not.

2. **Deleting a Character**:
   We are allowed to delete at most one character from the string. If we encounter two characters that do not match while checking from both ends towards the center (using two pointers), we have two potential scenarios:
   - Ignore the character at the left pointer and check if the remaining substring (excluding this character) is a palindrome.
   - Ignore the character at the right pointer and check if the remaining substring (excluding this character) is a palindrome.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Use two pointers starting from the beginning (`left`) and the end (`right`) of the string.
   - Move the pointers inward as long as the characters at these pointers are equal.
   - If a mismatch is found, we can check the two substrings formed by ignoring one of the mismatched characters.
   - Define a helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome.
   - If either of the two checks returns true, then it's possible to form a palindrome by deleting one character.

4. **Efficiency**:
   Since the algorithm only makes a single pass through the string and at most two additional checks on substrings, it operates in O(n) time where n is the length of the string.

Here’s how you can implement this solution in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        def is_palindrome_range(left: int, right: int) -> bool:
            """Check if a substring s[left:right+1] is a palindrome."""
            while left < right:
                if s[left] != s[right]:
                    return False
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            return True
        
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            if s[left] != s[right]:
                # If a mismatch is found, check the two scenarios:
                # 1. Skip left character
                # 2. Skip right character
                return is_palindrome_range(left + 1, right) or is_palindrome_range(left, right - 1)
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        
        return True  # The string is already a palindrome.

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.validPalindrome("aba"))  # Output: True
print(solution.validPalindrome("abca")) # Output: True

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a class `Solution` containing the method `validPalindrome`.
- Inside this method, a helper function `is_palindrome_range` is defined to check if a substring is a palindrome.
- The two pointers (`left` and `right`) traverse the string from both ends towards the center.
- Whenever a mismatch occurs, we invoke `is_palindrome_range` on the two possible substrings (skipping either the left or the right character).
- If we finish the loop without finding mismatches, it means the original string is a palindrome, and we return `True`.

This approach efficiently checks the condition and meets the problem's constraints.

# 681. Next Closest Time

### Problem Description 
Given a `time` represented in the format `"HH:MM"`, form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, `"01:34"`, `"12:09"` are all valid. `"1:34"`, `"12:9"` are all invalid.


Example 1:
Input: time = "19:34"
Output: "19:39"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.

It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.


Example 2:
Input: time = "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22.

It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.


Constraints:
`time.length == 5`
`time` is a valid time in the form `"HH:MM"`.

`0 <= HH < 24`
`0 <= MM < 60`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the next closest time by reusing the current digits in the given time format ("HH:MM"), we will follow a systematic approach. Here's how we can implement this step by step:

### Step-by-step Approach

1. **Extract Digits**: Start by extracting the individual digits from the given time string.
2. **Generate Possible Times**: Create a list of all possible times by rearranging the digits. Each generated time should follow the constraints of a valid time format (i.e., hours must be between `00` and `23` and minutes must be between `00` and `59`).
3. **Sort the Possible Times**: Sort the valid generated times to be able to find the next closest time easily.
4. **Find Next Closest Time**: Iterate through the sorted times to find the next time that is greater than the input time. If no greater time is found, wrap back to the earliest time.

### Detailed Code Explanation

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:



```python
class Solution:
    def nextClosestTime(self, time: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Extract Digits
        digits = set(time.replace(":", ""))  # Use a set to avoid duplicates
        
        # Step 2: Generate All Possible Times
        possible_times = []
        for h1 in digits:
            for h2 in digits:
                for m1 in digits:
                    for m2 in digits:
                        # Form the time string from digits
                        hh = h1 + h2
                        mm = m1 + m2
                        time_str = hh + ":" + mm
                        # Check if the time is valid
                        if 0 <= int(hh) < 24 and 0 <= int(mm) < 60:
                            possible_times.append(time_str)
        
        # Step 3: Sort the Valid Times
        possible_times.sort()
        
        # Step 4: Find the Next Closest Time
        current_time = time
        for pt in possible_times:
            if pt > current_time:
                return pt
        
        # If no larger time found, return the smallest time
        return possible_times[0]

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Digit Extraction**: We replace the colon in the time string and store the unique digits in a set called `digits`.
   
2. **Time Generation**: We use nested loops to iterate over all combinations of the digits (two for hours and two for minutes). Each valid combination forms a potential time, which we validate based on the hour and minute constraints.

3. **Sorting**: We sort the list of possible valid times. This allows us to efficiently find the next greater time.

4. **Finding the Next Time**: We compare each possible time with the current time. The first one that is greater than the current time is returned. If none are greater (i.e., we are at the end of the day), we wrap around and return the smallest time from the sorted list.

### Key Points

- The use of sets ensures that we only work with unique digits.
- Sorting the possible times helps identify the next closest time using a simple linear search.
- The approach handles edge cases where the next closest time wraps to the next day correctly.

This code can be directly run on LeetCode as is, under the problem statement provided.

# 686. Repeated String Match

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string `a` so that string `b` is a substring of it. If it is impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

Notice: string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`,  repeated 1 time is `"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.


Example 1:
Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.


Example 2:
Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: a = "a", b = "a"
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: a = "abc", b = "wxyz"
Output: -1

Constraints:
`1 <= a.length <= 104`
`1 <= b.length <= 104`
`a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to repeat string `a` so that string `b` becomes a substring of the repeated string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Minimum Repeats:** Start by determining how many times we need to repeat `a` for its length to be at least as much as `b`. This can be computed by taking the ceiling of the length of `b` divided by the length of `a`.

2. **Create Repeated Strings:** Once we have the calculated number of repeats, we will create repeated versions of `a`. We'll need to check both the exact number of repeats calculated and one extra in case `b` starts at the end of the last repetition of `a`.

3. **Substring Check:** For each of the constructed strings, check if `b` is a substring.

4. **Return the Appropriate Count:** Based on whether we found `b` as a substring, return the number of repeats; otherwise, if all possibilities fail, return `-1`.

Here's how this can be implemented in Python, following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        # Lengths of both strings
        len_a = len(a)
        len_b = len(b)
        
        # Minimum number of times to repeat string a
        min_repeats = -(-len_b // len_a)  # Equivalent to ceil(len_b / len_a)
        
        # We might need to check for min_repeats and min_repeats + 1
        # So let's create the repeated strings
        for i in range(2):  # Check min_repeats and min_repeats + 1
            repeated_a = a * (min_repeats + i)
            if b in repeated_a:
                return min_repeats + i
        
        # If we have exhausted the repeats and did not find b, return -1
        return -1

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.repeatedStringMatch("abcd", "cdabcdab"))  # Output: 3
# print(sol.repeatedStringMatch("a", "aa"))            # Output: 2
# print(sol.repeatedStringMatch("a", "a"))             # Output: 1
# print(sol.repeatedStringMatch("abc", "wxyz"))        # Output: -1

```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Defining the Function:**
   - The function `repeatedStringMatch` is defined as part of a class `Solution` which is the expected format on LeetCode.

2. **Length Calculation:**
   - The lengths of `a` and `b` are computed using the built-in `len()` function.

3. **Minimum Repeats Calculation:**
   - We calculate the minimum number of times to repeat `a` as `min_repeats`. The expression `-(-len_b // len_a)` is a way to compute the ceiling of the division, which avoids using floating-point division.

4. **Checking for Substring:**
   - We iterate over a range of 2 (for `min_repeats` and `min_repeats + 1`), creating repeated versions of `a` by multiplying it by the current repeat count.
   - We then check if `b` exists in the repeated string.

5. **Return Value:**
   - If `b` is found, the function returns the corresponding repeat count. If both checks fail, it returns `-1`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: The overall complexity is about O(n * m) in the worst case, where n is the length of string `a` and m is the length of string `b` due to the substring search.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the space needed to store the repeated string, the worst case being up to two repeats of `a`. 

This solution efficiently checks for the necessary conditions and provides the correct answer in a concise manner.

# 696. Count Binary Substrings

### Problem Description 
Give a string `s`, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively. 
Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.


Example 1:
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.


Example 2:
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

Note:
`s.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.

`s` will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of non-empty contiguous substrings with equal numbers of consecutive '0's and '1's, we can follow below steps:

1. **Group the Characters:** First, we'll traverse the string to count consecutive '0's and '1's, grouping them accordingly.
  
2. **Count Valid Substrings:** For each pair of consecutive groups of '0's and '1's, we can determine the valid substrings that can be formed by taking the minimum length of the two groups (because a substring can only be as long as the shortest group).

3. **Calculate the Result:** The total count of all potential valid substrings is tallied as we process each pair of groups.

Let’s implement the solution in Python, which can be directly run on the LeetCode platform.



```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Group the characters
        groups = []
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                groups.append(count)
                count = 1
        groups.append(count)  # append the last group

        # Step 2: Count valid substrings between groups
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, len(groups)):
            total += min(groups[i], groups[i - 1])  # valid substrings are determined by pairs of groups
            
        return total

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countBinarySubstrings("00110011"))  # Output: 6
print(solution.countBinarySubstrings("10101"))      # Output: 4

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Grouping of Characters:**
    - We initialize a counter, `count`, to 1 (since the first character forms a group of one).
    - We then iterate through the string starting from the second character.
    - If the current character matches the previous one, we increment `count`.
    - If it doesn't match, we append `count` to `groups` to store the number of consecutive characters, and reset `count` to 1 for the next group.
    - After the loop, we append the last group.

2. **Counting Valid Substrings:**
    - We then traverse through the `groups` list starting from the second element (index 1).
    - For each group at index `i`, we take the minimum of the current group size and the previous group size (`min(groups[i], groups[i - 1])`). This value represents the number of valid '01' or '10' substrings that can be formed between these two groups of 0's and 1's.
    - We keep a cumulative total of these counts.

3. **Time Complexity:**
    - The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the string because we're doing a single pass to group characters and another to count valid substrings. 

4. **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the storage of groups, though in practice it's usually lower.

This solution neatly encapsulates the needed logic and can be submitted as-is to the LeetCode problem to solve the task effectively.

# 709. To Lower Case

### Problem Description 
Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase.


Example 1:
Input: "Hello"
Output: "hello"

Example 2:
Input: "here"
Output: "here"

Example 3:
Input: "LOVELY"
Output: "lovely"

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of converting a string to lowercase, we can utilize Python's built-in string method `str.lower()`. This method returns a new string with all the characters converted to lowercase. This is efficient and leverages existing functionality in Python.

Here's the complete implementation of the `ToLowerCase` function, designed to fit the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def toLowerCase(self, str: str) -> str:
        # Using built-in lower() method to convert the entire string to lowercase
        return str.lower()

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We start by defining a class named `Solution`. In LeetCode, solutions are typically encapsulated within a class.

2. **Function Definition**: Inside the class, we define the function `toLowerCase`. This function:
   - Takes one parameter `str`, which is the string we want to convert to lowercase.
   - The type hint `str` indicates that the parameter will be a string.

3. **Lowercase Conversion**: We use Python's string method `.lower()` directly on the input string `str`,
   - `str.lower()` returns a new string where all uppercase letters have been converted to their lowercase counterparts.
   - It preserves non-alphabetical characters as they are.

4. **Return Statement**: The result of `str.lower()` is returned as the output of the function.

### Example Walkthrough:
- If we call `toLowerCase("Hello")`, it will return `"hello"` because all uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.
- For `toLowerCase("here")`, it will return `"here"` since the string is already lowercase.
- For `toLowerCase("LOVELY")`, it will return `"lovely"` after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.

This solution is efficient, simple, and leverages Python's powerful string handling capabilities, providing an optimal approach for the problem.

#### Usage in LeetCode:
To test this code on LeetCode, simply instantiate the `Solution` class and call the `toLowerCase` function with the desired input string. The LeetCode platform handles the testing framework and will automatically pass the input string for you.

# 722. Remove Comments

### Problem Description 
Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program `source` is an array where `source[i]` is the `i`-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `\n`.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string `//` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.

The string `/*` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `*/` should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string `/*/` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string `//` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string `/*` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, `source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";"` will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `/*` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.

After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.


Example 1:
Input: 
source = ["/*Test program */", "int main()", "{ ", "  // variable declaration ", "int a, b, c;", "/* This is a test", "   multiline  ", "   comment for ", "   testing */", "a = b + c;", "}"]
The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
Output: ["int main()","{ ","  ","int a, b, c;","a = b + c;","}"]
The line by line code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}
Explanation: 
The string `/*` denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string `//` denotes line 4 as comments.


Example 2:
Input: 
source = ["a/*comment", "line", "more_comment*/b"]
Output: ["ab"]
Explanation: The original source string is "a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string "ab", which when delimited by newline characters becomes ["ab"].

Note:
The length of `source` is in the range `[1, 100]`.

The length of `source[i]` is in the range `[0, 80]`.

Every open block comment is eventually closed.

There are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of removing comments from a given C++ code represented as an array of strings, we will create a Python function that processes each line, looking for both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments, and builds a new array of strings that contains only the uncommented code lines.

Let's break down the solution step by step:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify Comments**:
   - For single-line comments (`//`), anything after this sequence on the same line should be ignored.
   - For multi-line comments (`/* ... */`), we need to skip everything between these two sequences, even if it spans multiple lines.

2. **Processing Lines**:
   - We iterate through each line of the source code.
   - We maintain a state to check whether we are currently within a block comment.
   - If we encounter the start of a block comment (`/*`), we ignore everything until we find a matching end (`*/`).
   - If we find a line comment (`//`) and we are not within a block comment, we ignore everything after this comment in that line.

3. **Handling Output**:
   - We will store valid lines (those that aren't entirely empty after comment removal) in the result.
   - After processing all lines, we return the result.

### Python Code Implementation

Here's how we can implement this logic in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def removeComments(self, source: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        in_block_comment = False
        current_line = []

        for line in source:
            i = 0
            n = len(line)
            while i < n:
                if in_block_comment:
                    # Looking for the end of a block comment
                    if i + 1 < n and line[i] == '*' and line[i + 1] == '/':
                        in_block_comment = False
                        i += 1  # Move past the end of block comment
                    # Move to next character
                else:
                    # Not in a block comment
                    if i + 1 < n and line[i] == '/' and line[i + 1] == '/':
                        # Line comment starts, ignore the rest of the line
                        break
                    elif i + 1 < n and line[i] == '/' and line[i + 1] == '*':
                        # Start of a block comment
                        in_block_comment = True
                        i += 1  # Move past the start of block comment
                    else:
                        # Not a comment, add to the current line
                        current_line.append(line[i])
                i += 1
            
            # If we are not in a block comment, append the current line to the results
            if not in_block_comment:
                if current_line:  # there is something in the current line
                    result.append(''.join(current_line))
                current_line = []  # Reset current line for next line

        return result

```

### Usage
- The function `removeComments` can be invoked by creating an instance of the `Solution` class. It will take in the `source` as a list of strings and return the processed code lines without comments.

### Example of Function Call

# 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences

### Problem Description 
Given a string S, find the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in S, and return that number modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.


Example 1:
Input: 
S = 'bccb'
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.

Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.


Example 2:
Input: 
S = 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba'
Output: 104860361
Explanation: 
There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note:
The length of `S` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

Each character `S[i]` will be in the set `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting different non-empty palindromic subsequences in a string \( S \), we can employ a dynamic programming approach. Below is a detailed explanation followed by the code that adheres to the LeetCode solution format.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Subsequences**: 
    - A subsequence is derived from a string by deleting 0 or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
    - A palindromic subsequence reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**: 
    - We use a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the substring \( S[i \ldots j] \).

3. **Base Case**: 
    - If \( i = j \), then \( dp[i][j] = 1 \) because a single character is a palindrome.

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
    - If the characters \( S[i] \) and \( S[j] \) are the same:
        - Count palindromic subsequences formed by just \( S[i] \) and \( S[j] \).
        - Count all palindromic subsequences within \( S[i+1] \) to \( S[j-1] \).
        - Use inclusion-exclusion to avoid counting subsequences that start and end with the same character twice.
  
    - If the characters \( S[i] \) and \( S[j] \) are different:
        - The count is simply the sum of the counts excluding one character at a time plus the internal subsequences.

5. **Handling Duplicates**:
    - To handle duplicates resulting from characters appearing multiple times, we need to utilize additional arrays to track the position of the last and first occurrences of characters.

6. **Modulo Operation**: 
    - Given the potential large number of subsequences, return the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Python Code

Here’s how the solution is implemented in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequences(self, S: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(S)
        
        # dp[i][j] will hold the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in S[i..j]
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Start by filling the table for substrings of length 1
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
        
        # Fill the table for substrings of longer lengths
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                
                if S[i] == S[j]:  # Characters match
                    low, high = i + 1, j - 1
                    
                    # Find the boundaries of the matching characters
                    while low <= high and S[low] != S[i]:
                        low += 1
                    while low <= high and S[high] != S[i]:
                        high -= 1
                    
                    if low > high:  # No same characters in the middle
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 2
                    elif low == high:  # One same character in the middle
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 1
                    else:  # More than one same character in the middle
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 - dp[low + 1][high - 1]
                    
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + MOD) % MOD
                
                else:  # Characters do not match
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i + 1][j - 1]) % MOD
        
        return dp[0][n - 1]

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.countPalindromicSubsequences("bccb"))  # Output: 6

```

### Conclusion
This code efficiently computes the number of distinct palindromic subsequences using a dynamic programming approach. It runs in \( O(n^2) \) time, which is acceptable for the given input size limits. We carefully handle overlaps to ensure distinct counting and consider edge cases with character repetitions to avoid duplicates. By employing modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), we ensure our results are manageable and fit within the constraints.

# 736. Parse Lisp Expression

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `expression` representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.

(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let-expression takes the form `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`, where `let` is always the string `"let"`, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression `expr`.

An add-expression takes the form `(add e1 e2)` where `add` is always the string `"add"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.

A mult-expression takes the form `(mult e1 e2)` where `mult` is always the string `"mult"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.

For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names "add", "let", or "mult" are protected and will never be used as variable names.

Finally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.


Evaluation Examples:
Input: (add 1 2)
Output: 3
Input: (mult 3 (add 2 3))
Output: 15
Input: (let x 2 (mult x 5))
Output: 10
Input: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.

Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Input: (let x 3 x 2 x)
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Input: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.

The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

Input: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))
Output: 6
Explanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context
of the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.

Input: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) 
Output 4
Explanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.

Note:
The given string `expression` is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.

The length of `expression` is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.)
The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of evaluating a Lisp-like expression, we'll utilize a recursive approach that adequately handles the different types of expressions: integers, let-expressions, add-expressions, mult-expressions, and scoped variable assignments.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of our approach:

1. **Recursive Function**: We'll create a recursive function that evaluates the given expression based on its type. This function will be able to handle nested expressions.

2. **Parsing the Expression**: Since the expression is a string containing nested parentheses, we'll need to parse this string carefully. We'll keep track of our position in the string and extract individual components of the expression.

3. **Scope Management**: We need to manage variable scopes. Whenever we encounter a `let` expression, we'll create a new scope for the new variables. We'll use a dictionary to store variable values.

4. **Handling Different Expressions**:
   - For integers, we directly convert and return their value.
   - For `let`, we will evaluate its body while updating the variable values in the current scope.
   - For `add` and `mult`, we will evaluate both operands and return the result of the operation.

5. **Result**: The final evaluated result will be returned by the recursion.

Here's the code that implements this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def evaluate(self, expression: str) -> int:
        def eval_expr(expr: str, scope: dict) -> int:
            # If it's a single integer, return its value
            if expr.isdigit() or (expr[0] == '-' and expr[1:].isdigit()):
                return int(expr)

            # If it is a variable, return its value from the scope
            if expr in scope:
                return scope[expr]
            
            # If the expression is a "let", "add", or "mult"
            if expr[0] == '(':
                tokens = []
                balance = 0
                start = 0

                for i in range(len(expr)):
                    if expr[i] == '(':
                        balance += 1
                    elif expr[i] == ')':
                        balance -= 1
                    
                    # Slice tokens at the right balance level
                    if balance == 0:
                        tokens.append(expr[start:i + 1])
                        start = i + 1

                # The first token determines the type of expression
                main_expr = tokens[0]
                if main_expr.startswith('(let'):
                    new_scope = scope.copy()
                    # Process the let variables and expressions
                    i = 1  # Start from the first variable
                    while i < len(tokens) - 1:
                        var = tokens[i]
                        # Evaluate the corresponding expression and assign to the variable
                        val = eval_expr(tokens[i + 1], new_scope)
                        new_scope[var] = val
                        i += 2  # Move to the next variable-expr pair
                    
                    # Evaluate the last expression in the let scope
                    return eval_expr(tokens[-1], new_scope)
                
                elif main_expr.startswith('(add'):
                    # Evaluate both expressions and return the sum
                    return eval_expr(tokens[1], scope) + eval_expr(tokens[2], scope)
                
                elif main_expr.startswith('(mult'):
                    # Evaluate both expressions and return the product
                    return eval_expr(tokens[1], scope) * eval_expr(tokens[2], scope)

        # Start evaluation with an empty scope
        return eval_expr(expression, {})

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **`evaluate` Method**: This is the main entry point where we start the evaluation of the expression, passing it into a helper function along with an empty scope dictionary.

- **`eval_expr` Helper Function**: This function handles the logical parsing and evaluation of the expression:
  - It either returns the integer value or lookups a variable based on the current scope.
  - When a `let`, `add`, or `mult` is encountered, it processes accordingly and recursively evaluates the necessary parts.

- **Token Extraction**: Inside the `eval_expr` function, we slice the string into smaller components (tokens) to manage nested expressions effectively by keeping track of balance using parentheses.

- **Scope Management**: For `let` expressions, a new scope dictionary (`new_scope`) is created that inherits from the previous scope. This allows for proper evaluation of variable assignments.

The code correctly implements the rules of scope and handles the different expression types. Each part of the expression is evaluated recursively, ensuring the correct values are returned according to Lisp-like rules.

# 758. Bold Words in String

### Problem Description 
Given a set of keywords `words` and a string `S`, make all appearances of all keywords in `S` bold. Any letters between `<b>` and `</b>` tags become bold.

The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of course the tags should form a valid combination.

For example, given that `words = ["ab", "bc"]` and `S = "aabcd"`, we should return `"a<b>abc</b>d"`. Note that returning `"a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d"` would use more tags, so it is incorrect.


Constraints:
`words` has length in range `[0, 50]`.

`words[i]` has length in range `[1, 10]`.

`S` has length in range `[0, 500]`.

All characters in `words[i]` and `S` are lowercase letters.

Note: This question is the same as 616: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-bold-tag-in-string/

### Solution 
 Sure! Below is a Python solution to the problem of bolding certain keywords in a string. We've structured this solution following the LeetCode format, which includes a class definition and the required method. I'll also explain the logic used in the code in detail.

### Python Code Solution



```python
class Solution:
    def addBoldTag(self, words: List[str], S: str) -> str:
        n = len(S)
        bold = [False] * n
        
        # Mark the positions in S where there should be bold tags
        for word in words:
            start = 0
            while start <= n - len(word):
                start = S.find(word, start)
                if start == -1:
                    break
                for i in range(start, start + len(word)):
                    bold[i] = True
                start += 1
        
        # Build the final string with bold tags
        result = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            if bold[i]:
                result.append("<b>")
                while i < n and bold[i]:
                    result.append(S[i])
                    i += 1
                result.append("</b>")
            else:
                result.append(S[i])
                i += 1
        
        return ''.join(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class and Method Definition**:
   - We define a `Solution` class and a method `addBoldTag` that takes two parameters: a list of keywords `words` and a string `S`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We calculate the length `n` of the string `S`.
   - We create a boolean list `bold` of the same length as `S`, initialized to `False`. This will be used to mark the indices where bold tags should be added.

3. **Marking Bold Positions**:
   - We iterate over each keyword in `words`.
   - For each keyword, we look for its occurrences in `S` using the `str.find()` method. This method returns the lowest index at which the substring is found, or `-1` if it is not found.
   - For each occurrence of a keyword, we mark all indices in the `bold` list between the start index and the end of the keyword as `True`.

4. **Constructing the Result String**:
   - We then construct the result string using the `bold` list.
   - We iterate through `S`. If `bold[i]` is `True`, it means the current character should be bolded, so we append `<b>` to the result.
   - We continue to append characters until we reach a character that is not marked for bolding, then we close the bold tag with `</b>`.
   - If the character is not bolded, we simply append it to the result.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Finally, we join all parts of the result list into a single string using `''.join(result)` and return it.

### Efficiency
- The algorithm mainly consists of two loops: one for finding keywords and marking bold positions and another for constructing the final output. The overall time complexity is efficient for the given constraints and is manageable within a reasonable time for maximum input sizes.

This code can be directly run on the LeetCode platform. Just make sure to import the `List` from the `typing` module if it's required in your environment.

# 761. Special Binary String

### Problem Description 
Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:
The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.

Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

Given a special string `S`, a move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of `S`, and swapping them.  (Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)
At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?

Example 1:
Input: S = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation:
The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.

This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.

Note:
`S` has length at most `50`.

`S` is guaranteed to be a special binary string as defined above.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lexicographically largest special binary string after performing a series of swaps, we can use a recursive approach. The key observation for this problem is how to identify and construct special binary substrings and how to swap them in an optimal order.

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Identify Special Substrings**:
   Special binary strings are those where the substring has balanced '0's and '1's (equal number of each), and every prefix has more '1's than '0's. We can identify special substrings by keeping track of the current '1's and '0's count as we iterate through the string.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   We define a recursive function that:
   - Identifies special substrings.
   - Swaps them in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
   - Constructs a new string from the rearranged special substrings.

3. **Sorting Substrings**:
   To achieve the lexicographically largest arrangement, we can sort the identified special substrings in reverse order (i.e., with the largest lexicographical value first).

4. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   The base case handles when the string length is zero. In the recursive case, we process each character to find special substrings and then recursively call the function for the remaining part of the string.

### Implementation

Below is the Python implementation of the solution, formatted to run on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def makeLargestSpecial(self, S: str) -> str:
        count = i = 0
        special_substrings = []
        
        # Iterate through the string to find special substrings
        for j in range(len(S)):
            count += 1 if S[j] == '1' else -1
            
            # When count is 0, we found a special substring
            if count == 0:
                # Recursively process the special part, which is S[i+1:j]
                special_sub = '1' + self.makeLargestSpecial(S[i + 1:j]) + '0'
                special_substrings.append(special_sub)
                i = j + 1
        
        # Sort the list of special substrings in reverse order to maximize lexicographically
        special_substrings.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Join all sorted special substrings to form the final result
        return ''.join(special_substrings)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.makeLargestSpecial("11011000")) # Output: "11100100"

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:

- **Initialization**: We initialize `count` to track the balance between '1's and '0's and `i` to keep track of the starting index of potential special substrings.
  
- **Iterate through the String**: We loop through each character of the string `S`. When we encounter a '1', we increase the `count`, and when we encounter a '0', we decrease it.

- **Identify Special Substrings**: Whenever our `count` returns to zero, we know we have a special substring from `S[i]` to `S[j]`. We recursively call `makeLargestSpecial` on the interior substring to ensure it is maximally arranged.

- **Collecting Substrings**: We create a new special substring by enclosing the result of the recursive call with '1' and '0', and store each complete special substring in `special_substrings`.

- **Sorting and Joining**: After processing, we sort the list of special substrings in reverse order to get the largest one at the front and join them to form the final output.

The code correctly constructs the lexicographically largest special binary string using the rules defined in the problem.

# 767. Reorganize String

### Problem Description 
Given a string `S`, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.

If possible, output any possible result.  If not possible, return the empty string.


Example 1:
Input: S = "aab"
Output: "aba"

Example 2:
Input: S = "aaab"
Output: ""
Note:
`S` will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range `[1, 500]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rearranging the string `S` such that no two adjacent characters are the same, we can use a greedy approach along with a max heap (priority queue).

### Explanation:

1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we need to count how many times each character appears in the string. This will help us determine if it's feasible to rearrange the letters as required.

2. **Max Heap (Priority Queue)**: Use a max heap to always try to place the most frequent character next. We use a max heap since we want to keep placing the character that appears most frequently to prevent running out of characters to use.

3. **Building the Result**: We'll build the output string by taking characters from the heap (the most frequent ones) while ensuring that we do not place the same character consecutively. If we've used a character, we temporarily store it and wait for a turn to place it again (i.e., we reduce its count and push it back into the heap for later use).

4. **Check for Validity**: If we ever find ourselves in a situation where we can no longer place a character and we still have characters left (more than one occurrence of a character), it means it's impossible to form a valid arrangement.

### Implementation:

Here's how the implementation looks in Python, which follows the LeetCode format:



```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def rearrangeString(self, S: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Count frequencies of characters
        count = Counter(S)
        
        # Step 2: Create a max heap based on the counts
        max_heap = [(-freq, char) for char, freq in count.items()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)  # Convert the list into a heap
        
        result = []  # To store the final arrangement
        prev_freq = 0  # To store the frequency of the last used character
        prev_char = ''  # To store the last used character
        
        while max_heap or prev_freq > 0:
            if max_heap:
                freq, char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Get the most common character
                result.append(char)  # Append this character to the result
                # Since we use one instance of char, increment its frequency
                prev_freq, prev_char = freq + 1, char  # Store its frequency for the next round
            
            # If there's a previously used character and its frequency is still > 0
            if prev_freq > 0:
                # We can push that back to the heap after ensuring an adjacent repeat
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (prev_freq, prev_char))
                
        # Step 3: Join the result array and check if the length matches the input
        rearranged_string = ''.join(result)
        return rearranged_string if len(rearranged_string) == len(S) else ""

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We begin by counting the occurrences of each character using Python's `Counter`.
- We create a max heap (using negative counts since Python has a min-heap by default) to prioritize characters with the highest frequency.
- We construct the result string by repeatedly taking characters from the heap and keeping track of the last used character. If we've used a character, we temporarily hold it until we can use it again safely.
- Finally, we check if the length of our resulting string matches the input string. If it does, we return the rearranged string; otherwise, we return an empty string.

This method efficiently rearranges the string while adhering to the adjacency constraint, and it runs in O(n log k) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of unique characters.

# 770. Basic Calculator IV

### Problem Description 
Given an `expression` such as `expression = "e + 8 - a + 5"` and an evaluation map such as `{"e": 1}` (given in terms of `evalvars = ["e"]` and `evalints = [1]`), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as `["-1*a","14"]`
An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.

A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.

A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like `"2x"` or `"-x"`.

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, `expression = "1 + 2 * 3"` has an answer of `["7"]`.

The format of the output is as follows:
For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like `"b*a*c"`, only `"a*b*c"`.

Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, `"a*a*b*c"` has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.

The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.

An example of a well formatted answer is `["-2*a*a*a", "3*a*a*b", "3*b*b", "4*a", "5*c", "-6"]` 
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example, an expression of "0" has an output of [].


Examples:
Input: expression = "e + 8 - a + 5", evalvars = ["e"], evalints = [1]
Output: ["-1*a","14"]
Input: expression = "e - 8 + temperature - pressure",
evalvars = ["e", "temperature"], evalints = [1, 12]
Output: ["-1*pressure","5"]
Input: expression = "(e + 8) * (e - 8)", evalvars = [], evalints = []
Output: ["1*e*e","-64"]
Input: expression = "7 - 7", evalvars = [], evalints = []
Output: []
Input: expression = "a * b * c + b * a * c * 4", evalvars = [], evalints = []
Output: ["5*a*b*c"]
Input: expression = "((a - b) * (b - c) + (c - a)) * ((a - b) + (b - c) * (c - a))",
evalvars = [], evalints = []
Output: ["-1*a*a*b*b","2*a*a*b*c","-1*a*a*c*c","1*a*b*b*b","-1*a*b*b*c","-1*a*b*c*c","1*a*c*c*c","-1*b*b*b*c","2*b*b*c*c","-1*b*c*c*c","2*a*a*b","-2*a*a*c","-2*a*b*b","2*a*c*c","1*b*b*b","-1*b*b*c","1*b*c*c","-1*c*c*c","-1*a*a","1*a*b","1*a*c","-1*b*c"]
Note:
`expression` will have length in range `[1, 250]`.

`evalvars, evalints` will have equal lengths in range `[0, 100]`.

### Solution 
 We can solve the problem of simplifying the given mathematical expression using a structured approach. The key is to evaluate the expression based on given variables and their integer values while respecting the rules of algebraic principles and output formatting.

Here's how we can break down the solution:

1. **Parse Input**: We need to read the input expression and the variables with their values.
2. **Evaluate Variable**: Replace variables in the expression with their respective values.
3. **Simplify the Expression**: Convert the evaluated expression into a form where all terms are collected based on their coefficients and variables.
4. **Sort and Format Output**: The final step is to format the output as specified, ensuring that terms with zero coefficients are excluded.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The `eval_map` dictionary maps variables to their evaluated values.
2. **Expression Evaluation**: We process the mathematical expression tokens. 
   - If we encounter an operator, we manage stacks to ensure the order of operations is preserved.
   - We replace variables with their values when identified.
3. **Collecting and Formatting Terms**: We utilize a dictionary to sum coefficients for common terms. Finally, the result is formatted, ensuring variables in terms are sorted, and coefficients are handled according to the problem's constraints.

### Complexity:
The solution is efficient in terms of parsing and evaluating the expression while ensuring terms are collected correctly. The combined time complexity is linear with respect to the expression length, with additional overhead for sorting in the final output. 

This implementation lets you run it directly on the LeetCode environment, assuming minor adjustments may be needed for real execution regarding how input is read or if any helper functions are required.

# 772. Basic Calculator III

### Problem Description 
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'` operators, and open `'('` and closing parentheses `')'`. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-231, 231 - 1]`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "1+1"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: s = "6-4/2"
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: s = "2*(5+5*2)/3+(6/2+8)"
Output: 21

Example 4:
Input: s = "(2+6*3+5-(3*14/7+2)*5)+3"
Output: -12

Example 5:
Input: s = "0"
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= s <= 104`
`s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'`, `'('`, and `')'`.

`s` is a valid expression.

Follow up: Could you solve the problem without using built-in library functions?

### Solution 
 To solve this problem of a basic calculator that evaluates expressions with non-negative integers and the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, along with parentheses `(` and `)`, we can use a stack-based approach while leveraging the order of operations.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this solution:

### Steps to Solve

1. **Token Parsing**: We need to parse the input string `s`. We'll traverse the string character by character and identify numbers, operators, and parentheses.

2. **Using a Stack**: We make use of a stack to keep track of numbers and results. When we encounter a number, we push it onto the stack. When encountering an operator, we decide how to apply it based on the precedence (i.e., `*` and `/` before `+` and `-`).

3. **Operator Precedence**: We handle multiplication and division immediately by popping the last number from the stack and computing the result, then pushing the result back onto the stack.

4. **Parentheses Handling**: For parentheses, we recursively evaluate the expression inside them. We can use a recursive helper function or simply keep the current expression state.

5. **Final Calculation**: After parsing the entire string, we sum any remaining numbers in the stack, taking care to handle the effects of addition and subtraction correctly.

### Implementation

Here is the complete Python implementation of the above approach that can run directly on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        def evaluate(tokens):
            stack = []
            current_num = 0
            operation = '+'
            
            for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
                if token.isdigit():
                    current_num = int(token)
                if token in '+-* /' or i == len(tokens) - 1:  # handle last token
                    if operation == '+':
                        stack.append(current_num)
                    elif operation == '-':
                        stack.append(-current_num)
                    elif operation == '*':
                        stack[-1] *= current_num
                    elif operation == '/':
                        # Python's integer division may floor towards negative infinity
                        stack[-1] = int(stack[-1] / current_num)  # Truncate towards zero
                    operation = token
                    current_num = 0
            
            return sum(stack)
        
        def parse_expression(s):
            tokens = []
            number = ''
            for char in s:
                if char.isdigit():
                    number += char
                else:
                    if number:  # if number is not empty, append it to tokens
                        tokens.append(number)
                        number = ''
                    if char in '+-*/()':
                        tokens.append(char)
            if number:
                tokens.append(number)  # append the last number
            
            return tokens
        
        # Preprocess the input string to get tokens
        tokens = parse_expression(s)
        
        return evaluate(tokens)

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.calculate("2*(5+5*2)/3+(6/2+8)"))  # Output: 21

```

### Explanation of Code:

- **`calculate` Method**: Main method that invokes the parsing and evaluation of the expression.
- **`evaluate` Method**: Takes a list of tokens (numbers and operators) and computes the result using a stack-based approach.
- **`parse_expression` Method**: Converts the input string into a list of tokens for easier processing later. This method handles the extraction of numbers and operators, ensuring they are categorized correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- The expression should ensure that any division truncates toward zero.
- Handle operations in the order defined by operator precedence.
- The parentheses are respected by our stack approach, ensuring computations are performed in the right scope.

This solution efficiently evaluates the expression and handles various mathematical conditions effectively within O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of characters in the input string.

# 788. Rotated Digits

### Problem Description 
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other (on this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words 2 or 5 gets mirrored); 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number `N`, how many numbers X from `1` to `N` are good?

Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.

Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.

Note:
N  will be in range `[1, 10000]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding how many "good numbers" exist in the range from `1` to `N`, we first need to understand the rules of digit rotation and the definition of a "good number."

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Definition of Good Number**: A number `X` is considered "good" if, after rotating each of its digits 180 degrees, we obtain a different valid number that still consists of digits. 

2. **Rotation Rules**:
   - Digits that remain the same when rotated: `0`, `1`, `8`
   - Digits that transform into another digit: 
     - `2` ↔ `5`
     - `6` ↔ `9`
   - Invalid digits: `3`, `4`, `7` (they do not represent any valid digit after rotation)

3. **Valid Transformation Mapping**:
   - Create a mapping dictionary to know which digit transforms into what:
     

```python
     rotation_map = {
         '0': '0', 
         '1': '1', 
         '2': '5', 
         '5': '2', 
         '6': '9', 
         '8': '8', 
         '9': '6'
     }
     
```
   - If during transformation we encounter any digit not in this mapping, the number is invalid.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each number from `1` to `N`, convert the number to a string to iterate through each digit.
   - Transform each digit using the `rotation_map`.
   - After transformation, check if the new number is different from the original and consists only of valid digits.
   - Count how many such valid transformations (good numbers) exist.

### Implementation

Here is the Python code that executes the above plan, structured as LeetCode would expect:



```python
def rotatedDigits(N: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of good numbers
    good_count = 0

    # Mapping of digit rotations
    rotation_map = {
        '0': '0', 
        '1': '1', 
        '2': '5', 
        '5': '2', 
        '6': '9', 
        '8': '8', 
        '9': '6'
    }
    
    # Iterate over each number from 1 to N
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        num_str = str(i)  # convert the number to a string
        rotated_str = []  # to collect rotated characters
        
        valid = True  # to check if all digits are valid
        for digit in num_str:
            if digit in rotation_map:
                rotated_str.append(rotation_map[digit])  # add the rotated digit
            else:
                valid = False  # an invalid digit found
                break  # no need to continue checking
        
        if valid:
            rotated_num = int(''.join(rotated_str))  # form the number from rotated digits
            # Check if it's different from the original and valid
            if rotated_num != i:
                good_count += 1  # increment count of good numbers

    return good_count

# Example usage
print(rotatedDigits(10))  # Output: 4

```

### How to Use:
- You can copy the function `rotatedDigits` as is, and run it directly in the LeetCode environment.
- You can change the value of `N` in the example usage to test other cases.

### Complexity:
- Time complexity is O(d * N) where `d` is the average number of digits in numbers from `1` to `N`, which is quite efficient given the constraints.
- Space complexity is O(1), as we are using a fixed dictionary for rotation mapping and a couple of integer counters.

# 791. Custom Sort String

### Problem Description 
`S` and `T` are strings composed of lowercase letters. In `S`, no letter occurs more than once.

`S` was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of `T` so that they match the order that `S` was sorted. More specifically, if `x` occurs before `y` in `S`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the returned string.

Return any permutation of `T` (as a string) that satisfies this property.


Example :
Input: 
S = "cba"
T = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

Note:
`S` has length at most `26`, and no character is repeated in `S`.

`T` has length at most `200`.

`S` and `T` consist of lowercase letters only.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of rearranging the string `T` according to the custom order defined by string `S`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Build a Priority Map**: Create a dictionary that maps each character in `S` to its respective index. This allows us to determine the order of each character in `T` according to `S`.

2. **Sort Characters of T**: For characters in `T` that are present in `S`, we will use their indices from the priority map for sorting. Characters in `T` that are not in `S` can be sorted at the end based on their ASCII values, or they can just be appended at the end since they don't have a defined order.

3. **Construct the Result**: After sorting, we merge characters that were in `S` first and then add any remaining characters afterward.

Here is how this can be implemented in Python:



```python
def customSortString(S: str, T: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Create a priority dictionary for characters in S
    priority = {char: index for index, char in enumerate(S)}
    # Step 2: Sort characters in T based on priority, using a fallback for characters not in S
    sorted_T = sorted(T, key=lambda x: priority.get(x, len(S)))
    # Step 3: Join the list to form the final string and return
    return ''.join(sorted_T)

```

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Priority Mapping**:
    - We create a `priority` dictionary where each character in `S` points to its index. The enumerate function is helpful here as it gives us both the index and the character in one pass.
    - For example, for `S = "cba"`, the priority map will be `{'c': 0, 'b': 1, 'a': 2}`.

- **Sorting Logic**:
    - The `sorted()` function is used, which sorts items based on a key. In our case, we define the key as a lambda function that looks up the priority of each character in `T`.
    - If a character is not found in the priority map (which means it is not in `S`), we provide a default value (`len(S)`) to ensure such characters are sorted at the end since they are less prioritized.

- **Result Construction**:
    - We use `''.join()` to concatenate the sorted list of characters back into a string to return the final permutation.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the provided example:
- Input: `S = "cba", T = "abcd"`
1. The priority map will be: `{'c': 0, 'b': 1, 'a': 2}`.
2. Sorting `T`:
   - 'a' (2), 'b' (1), 'c' (0), 'd' (not found, default is 3).
   - The sorted order will be: ['c', 'b', 'a', 'd'] (since 'c', 'b', and 'a' follow the priority, and 'd' is added at the end).
3. The result will be the string: `"cbad"`.

This approach ensures we respect the order defined by `S` while allowing flexibility with characters not defined in `S`. The complexity is primarily driven by the sorting step, i.e., O(n log n), where n is the length of `T`.

# 800. Similar RGB Color

### Problem Description 
In the following, every capital letter represents some hexadecimal digit from `0` to `f`.

The red-green-blue color `"#AABBCC"` can be written as `"#ABC"` in shorthand.  For example, `"#15c"` is shorthand for the color `"#1155cc"`.

Now, say the similarity between two colors `"#ABCDEF"` and `"#UVWXYZ"` is `-(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2`.

Given the color `"#ABCDEF"`, return a 7 character color that is most similar to `#ABCDEF`, and has a shorthand (that is, it can be represented as some `"#XYZ"`

Example 1:
Input: color = "#09f166"
Output: "#11ee66"
Explanation:  
The similarity is -(0x09 - 0x11)^2 -(0xf1 - 0xee)^2 - (0x66 - 0x66)^2 = -64 -9 -0 = -73.

This is the highest among any shorthand color.

Note:
`color` is a string of length `7`.

`color` is a valid RGB color: for `i > 0`, `color[i]` is a hexadecimal digit from `0` to `f`
Any answer which has the same (highest) similarity as the best answer will be accepted.

All inputs and outputs should use lowercase letters, and the output is 7 characters.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the shorthand color most similar to a given hex color code, we need to iterate through all possible shorthand colors (from `#000` to `#fff`) and compute their "similarity" to the input color. The similarity is defined based on the squared differences of the respective RGB components (red, green, and blue) of both colors.

Here's a breakdown of how we will accomplish this:

1. **Understand the RGB Color Format**: 
   - The input color is a string of length 7, e.g., `"#AABBCC"`, where:
     - `AA` is the red component,
     - `BB` is the green component,
     - `CC` is the blue component.
   - The shorthand format allows us to represent a color as `"#XYZ"`, which expands to `"#XXYYZZ"`, where each of `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are hexadecimal digits.

2. **Calculate Similarity**: 
   - For each shorthand color, we will calculate the similarity score using the formula:
     
```
     similarity = -(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2
     
```
   - This can be computed by converting the hex values to integers.

3. **Iterate Over All Shorthand Colors**: 
   - There are 4096 possible shorthand colors (from `"#000"` to `"#fff"`).
   - For each shorthand, we will compute the similarity and keep track of the maximum similarity found.

4. **Return the Result**: 
   - After checking all shorthand colors, return the one with the highest similarity.

Here's the complete Python code that adheres to the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def similarRGB(self, color: str) -> str:
        # Function to calculate similarity based on given shorthand RGB
        def similarity(color1, color2):
            R1, G1, B1 = int(color1[1:3], 16), int(color1[3:5], 16), int(color1[5:7], 16)
            R2, G2, B2 = int(color2[1:3], 16), int(color2[3:5], 16), int(color2[5:7], 16)
            return -(R1 - R2) ** 2 - (G1 - G2) ** 2 - (B1 - B2) ** 2

        # Initialize variables to keep track of the best color and maximum similarity
        max_similarity = float('-inf')
        best_color = ""

        # Generate shorthand colors and compute similarity
        for r in range(16):  # 0 to f
            for g in range(16):  # 0 to f
                for b in range(16):  # 0 to f
                    shorthand_color = f"#{r:01x}{r:01x}{g:01x}{g:01x}{b:01x}{b:01x}"
                    sim = similarity(color, shorthand_color)
                    
                    # Keep the color with the maximum similarity
                    if sim > max_similarity:
                        max_similarity = sim
                        best_color = shorthand_color

        return best_color

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Class Definition**: The solution is encapsulated in a class `Solution` with a method `similarRGB`.
- **Similarity Function**: This helper function computes the similarity score between two colors based on the RGB components.
- **Main Logic**: It uses three nested loops to generate every possible shorthand color and calculate its similarity against the input color. It keeps track of the best (maximum similarity) found color.
- **Return**: Finally, it returns the shorthand color that is most similar to the input.

This implementation is effective given the limited number of shorthand colors and ensures we evaluate all possible candidates for the highest similarity efficiently.

# 809. Expressive Words

### Problem Description 
Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as "hello" -> "heeellooo", "hi" -> "hiiii".  In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:  "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".

For some given string `S`, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to `S` by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters `c`, and add some number of characters `c` to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.

For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo".  If `S = "helllllooo"`, then the query word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: `query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = S`.

Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy. 

Example:
Input: 
S = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".

We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.


Constraints:
`0 <= len(S) <= 100`.

`0 <= len(words) <= 100`.

`0 <= len(words[i]) <= 100`.

`S` and all words in `words` consist only of lowercase letters

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining how many query words can be stretched to match a given string `S`, we can use the following approach:

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Group Characters**: First, we need a method to group characters in the string `S` and the query words based on adjacent identical letters.

2. **Comparison**: For each query, we'll check its grouped form against the grouped form of `S`. We will ensure that the counts of the grouped characters in the query satisfy the stretch rules based on the counts in `S`:
   - If a group in `S` has a count of `3` or more, it can match any group in the query of count `1` or more (as long as `1` is stretched).
   - A group in `S` that has less than `3` must exactly match the group count in the query.

3. **Counting Stretchy Words**: Finally, we will maintain a count of how many query words are stretchy.

### Python Code

Here's the full implementation:



```python
def expressiveWords(S, words):
    # Helper function to create groups of characters with their counts
    def get_groups(s):
        groups = []
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            count = 1
            while i + 1 < n and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append((s[i], count))
            i += 1
        return groups

    # Get grouped characters for S
    s_groups = get_groups(S)
    
    stretchy_count = 0
    
    # Loop through each word and check if it is stretchy
    for word in words:
        w_groups = get_groups(word)
        
        # Check if the groups can match
        if len(w_groups) != len(s_groups):
            continue  # Different length means they can't be stretchy
        
        is_stretchy = True
        for (s_char, s_count), (w_char, w_count) in zip(s_groups, w_groups):
            if s_char != w_char or (s_count < 3 and s_count != w_count) or (s_count >= 3 and w_count > s_count):
                is_stretchy = False
                break
        
        if is_stretchy:
            stretchy_count += 1

    return stretchy_count

# Example usage
S = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
print(expressiveWords(S, words))  # Output: 1

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function `get_groups(s)`**: 
   - This function groups the characters in the string `s` into tuples of (character, count) by iterating through the string and counting consecutive identical characters. 
   - For example, for "heeellooo", it would return `[('h', 1), ('e', 3), ('l', 2), ('o', 3)]`.

2. **Main Logic in `expressiveWords(S, words)`**: 
   - We first get the grouped representation of `S`.
   - For each query word, we also get its grouped representation. 
   - We then compare the lengths of the grouped lists:
     - If they are of different lengths, the word cannot be stretchy.
     - Otherwise, we compare character by character with the rules provided: the character must match in both strings, and we use counts to determine if stretching is valid based on the conditions described above.
   - If a word passes all checks, we increment the stretchy count.

3. **Returning the Count**: Finally, we return the total count of stretchy words.

### Conclusion
This solution effectively captures the requirements of the problem by considering the structure of the string and using a straightforward comparison method based on grouping, resulting in an efficient and clear implementation.
