# 513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,5,6,null,null,7]
Output: 7

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the leftmost value in the last row of a binary tree, we can perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of the tree. During this traversal, we can keep track of the values at each level, and when we reach the last level (the deepest level of the tree), we can identify the leftmost value.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Queue Initialization**: We will use a queue to facilitate the breadth-first traversal of the tree.
2. **Level Traversal**: While the queue is not empty, we will continue to process nodes. For each level of the tree, we will keep track of the first element’s value as this will represent the leftmost value for that level.
3. **Updating the Last Leftmost Value**: As we traverse each level, we will update the last leftmost value when we move to a new level.
4. **Return the Last Leftmost Value**: After completing the traversal, the last leftmost value that we have recorded will correspond to the leftmost value of the last row.

### Python Code:
Here’s the Python code written according to the LeetCode format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def findBottomLeftValue(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        from collections import deque

        # Initialize the queue for level order traversal
        queue = deque([root])
        leftmost_value = None
        
        while queue:
            # Get the number of nodes at the current level
            level_length = len(queue)
            # Loop through the current level
            for i in range(level_length):
                node = queue.popleft()
                # If it's the first node in this level, update leftmost_value
                if i == 0:
                    leftmost_value = node.val
                # Add left and right children to the queue if they exist
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
        
        # At the end of the loop, leftmost_value is the leftmost value of the last row
        return leftmost_value

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Class Definition**: We start with defining the `TreeNode` class, which represents each node in the binary tree, and the `Solution` class that contains our method.
- **findBottomLeftValue Method**: This method takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the required leftmost value.
- **Using Deque**: A deque from the `collections` module is used to efficiently append and pop nodes from both ends.
- **Level Order Traversal**: We use a while loop to traverse each level of the tree. For each level, we check if there's any node and track the first node's value.
- **Updating Leftmost Value**: Only the first node of each level is considered for the leftmost value, so it only updates when `i == 0`.
- **Returning Result**: After processing all levels, the leftmost value of the last row of the tree is returned.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because we traverse each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(W), where W is the maximum width of the binary tree, which is at most O(N) in the case of a completely unbalanced tree.

This implementation efficiently determines the leftmost value of the last row in the binary tree.

# 514. Freedom Trail

### Problem Description 
In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door.

Given a string ring, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:
You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].

If the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.


Example:
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".

Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.

So the final output is 4.

Note:
Length of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100.

There are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.

It's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by rotating the string ring.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of steps required to spell a keyword using a ring of characters, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key is to keep track of the current position on the ring and the current character we need to spell from the key.

Here’s a detailed explanation of the algorithm, followed by the implementation in Python:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a string `ring` that represents the characters on the outer ring.
   - We need to spell out the `key` character by character.
   - Each character in the `ring` can be aligned to a specific direction (like a clock face).
   - We can rotate the ring either clockwise or anticlockwise to align a required character at the "12:00" position.
   - After aligning the character, we must press a button, which also takes an additional step.

2. **Approach**:
   - We'll use a recursive function with memoization (using a dictionary) to store results for subproblems so that they can be reused.
   - The state of our recursive function can be defined by:
     - `i`: The current index in the key we are trying to spell.
     - `j`: The current index in the ring that is aligned at the "12:00" position.
   - We will calculate the steps required to match the character from the key at index `i` from the current position of the ring at index `j`.
   - We'll consider both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations and pick the minimum of the two.
   - After calculating the number of steps needed for the current character, we add 1 for pressing the button and move to the next character.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(n * m * 26) where `n` is the length of the ring (up to 100), `m` is the length of the key (up to 100), and we have a lookup for 26 possible characters. In practice, the operations remain reasonable given the constraints.

### Implementation

Here’s how this can be implemented in a format suitable for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def findRotateSteps(self, ring: str, key: str) -> int:
        n = len(ring)
        m = len(key)
        
        # Dictionary to hold positions of each character in 'ring'
        pos = {}
        for i, char in enumerate(ring):
            if char not in pos:
                pos[char] = []
            pos[char].append(i)
        
        # DP memoization table
        memo = {}

        def dp(i, j):
            # if we completed the key, no more steps needed
            if i == m:
                return 0
            
            # Check if we already computed this state
            if (i, j) in memo:
                return memo[(i, j)]
            
            min_steps = float('inf')
            
            # Current character we need to align in ring
            for k in pos[key[i]]:
                # Calculate the number of steps to move from j to k
                clockwise_moves = abs(k - j)
                anticlockwise_moves = n - clockwise_moves
                steps = min(clockwise_moves, anticlockwise_moves)
                
                # Total steps: moves + press step + recursive step for the next character
                total_steps = steps + 1 + dp(i + 1, k)
                
                # Update minimum steps
                min_steps = min(min_steps, total_steps)
            
            # Memoize the result before returning
            memo[(i, j)] = min_steps
            return min_steps
        
        # Starting from position 0 in the ring and needing the first character of the key
        return dp(0, 0)

# Example usage
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.findRotateSteps("godding", "gd"))  # Output: 4

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: We compute the positions of each character in the ring for efficient look-ups later.
2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp(i, j)` function computes the minimum steps required to spell the `key` starting from the character in the `ring` aligned at index `j` and needing to spell the character at index `i` of the `key`.
3. **Base Case**: If we've spelled all characters in the `key` (`i == m`), we return 0.
4. **Recursive Case**: For each position of the required character in the `ring`, calculate the steps to rotate from the current character and recursively solve for the next character while updating the minimum steps needed.
5. **Memoization**: Results are stored in a dictionary to optimize calculations for overlapping subproblems.

This implementation works efficiently for the given constraints and should run directly on LeetCode.

# 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree (0-indexed).


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: [1,3,9]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Example 4:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [1,2]

Example 5:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 104]`.

`-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the largest value in each row of a binary tree, we'll implement a level order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal). The idea here is to visit each node level by level, maintaining a list to hold the maximum value found at each level.

### Steps to Approach:

1. **Use a Queue**: A queue is appropriate for level order traversal since it allows us to process nodes from the current level before moving on to the next.
2. **Iterate through each level**: For each level, we will find the maximum value of nodes at that level.
3. **Store Results**: We'll keep appending the maximum of each level to a result list, which we will return at the end.

### Implementation Details:

- If the input tree is empty (`root` is `None`), we will simply return an empty list.
- We use a queue to facilitate our level order traversal.
- For each level, we determine the size (the number of nodes at that level), iterate through the nodes, and find the maximum value.

Here's the Python code that implements this logic:



```python
from collections import deque
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> list[int]:
        # Result list to store the largest values of each row
        result = []
        
        # If the tree is empty, return an empty list
        if not root:
            return result
        
        # Initialize a queue for level order traversal
        queue = deque([root])
        
        # Process the tree level by level
        while queue:
            # Get the number of nodes at the current level
            level_size = len(queue)
            max_value = float('-inf')  # Initialize max_value
            
            for _ in range(level_size):
                # Pop a node from the queue
                node = queue.popleft()
                # Update the max value for this level
                if node.val > max_value:
                    max_value = node.val
                
                # Add the left child to the queue if it exists
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                # Add the right child to the queue if it exists
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            # After processing all nodes of this level, record the max value
            result.append(max_value)
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Class Definition**: We have a `TreeNode` class to represent the nodes of the binary tree, and a `Solution` class with the required method `largestValues`.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: We check if `root` is `None` (representing an empty tree) and return an empty list.
- **Level Order Traversal**: We utilize `deque` from the `collections` module to maintain the queue of nodes to process. For each level:
  - We determine the number of nodes currently in the queue (which represents the size of the current level).
  - We set `max_value` to negative infinity at the start of each level to ensure any node's value found will be larger.
  - For each node at the current level, we check its children and add them to the queue for processing in the next level.
  - Once we've processed all nodes at the current level, we append the `max_value` for that level to our results list.
  
This approach is efficient and runs in O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once, making it suitable for the constraints provided in the problem.

# 526. Beautiful Arrangement

### Problem Description 
Suppose you have `n` integers labeled `1` through `n`. A permutation of those `n` integers `perm` (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every `i` (`1 <= i <= n`), either of the following is true:
`perm[i]` is divisible by `i`.

`i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 15`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting beautiful arrangements, we can utilize a backtracking approach. We need to generate permutations of integers from `1` to `n` and check whether each permutation satisfies the conditions defined in the problem statement.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Beautiful Arrangements**:
   A beautiful arrangement with integers is defined by two conditions:
   - For each position `i`, `perm[i]` must either be divisible by `i` or `i` must be divisible by `perm[i]`.
   
2. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - We will use backtracking to generate all the permutations of the numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - We will maintain a boolean array to track which numbers have been used in the current permutation.
   - For each number at position `i`, we will check the two conditions for the arrangement to be considered beautiful.
   - If a valid condition is met, we will continue to the next position. If we fill all positions successfully, we found a valid arrangement and increase our count.

3. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a recursive function `backtrack(pos)` which will explore all possible arrangements starting from the position `pos`.
   - If `pos` exceeds `n`, it means we have a valid arrangement, and we increment our count.

### The Python Code (LeetCode Format):

Here is the complete implementation suitable for submission on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countArrangement(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Counter for beautiful arrangements
        count = 0
        
        # To keep track of used numbers
        used = [False] * (n + 1)
        
        def backtrack(pos):
            nonlocal count
            if pos > n:
                count += 1
                return
            
            for num in range(1, n + 1):
                # Check if the number is used
                if not used[num]:
                    # Check the conditions for beautiful arrangement
                    if num % pos == 0 or pos % num == 0:
                        used[num] = True
                        backtrack(pos + 1)  # Move to the next position
                        used[num] = False  # Backtrack
        
        backtrack(1)  # Start with the first position
        return count

```

### How to Run the Code on LeetCode:
1. Copy the code above.
2. Go to the LeetCode website and find the problem titled "Beautiful Arrangement".
3. Paste the code into the code editor.
4. Run the code to check if your solution works against the test cases provided by LeetCode.

### Explanation of the Code:
- `countArrangement` initializes a `count` variable to keep track of valid arrangements and a `used` list to track which numbers are currently utilized in the permutation.
- The `backtrack(pos)` function is called with the current position, starting at 1. 
- For every position, it checks each possible number (from 1 to `n`). If a number hasn't been used and satisfies the beautiful arrangement conditions, it marks it as used, recurses to the next position, and afterwards marks it for backtracking (i.e., it can be used in further possibilities).
- Once we reach `pos > n`, it increments the count as this indicates a valid arrangement has been found.
  
This implementation efficiently counts all possible beautiful arrangements for integers from `1` to `n` while adhering to the constraints provided.

# 529. Minesweeper

### Problem Description 
Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!
You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. 'M' represents an unrevealed mine, 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square, 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and finally 'X' represents a revealed mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:
If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to 'X'.

If an empty square ('E') with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.

If an empty square ('E') with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.

Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.


Example 1:
Input: 
[['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']]
Click : [3,0]
Output: 
[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]
Explanation:

Example 2:
Input: 
[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]
Click : [1,2]
Output: 
[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'X', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]
Explanation:
Note:
The range of the input matrix's height and width is [1,50].

The click position will only be an unrevealed square ('M' or 'E'), which also means the input board contains at least one clickable square.

The input board won't be a stage when game is over (some mines have been revealed).

For simplicity, not mentioned rules should be ignored in this problem. For example, you don't need to reveal all the unrevealed mines when the game is over, consider any cases that you will win the game or flag any squares.

### Solution 
 To solve the Minesweeper problem outlined, we will implement a method to process the board and reveal squares based on a click. The rules for revealing squares are defined, and we will follow these rules step-by-step. Below is a Python solution structured according to the LeetCode format.

### Detailed Explanation
1. **Input Structure**: We will receive a 2D list (`board`) representing the Minesweeper game board, and a list of integers (`click`) indicating where the user clicked on the board.

2. **Click Handling**:
   - If the clicked cell is a mine ('M'), we change it to 'X' (game over condition).
   - If the clicked cell is an empty square ('E'):
     - We must first check how many adjacent mines are in the neighboring cells.
     - If there are no adjacent mines, we convert this cell to 'B' and recur on all its adjacent 'E' squares.
     - If there are adjacent mines, we convert this cell to the corresponding digit based on the count of adjacent mines (from 1 to 8).

3. **Recursive Revealing**: We will use a helper function to recursively reveal cells until all possible empty cells are revealed.

4. **Adjusting Coordinates**: Since we will be checking adjacent squares, we need to be careful with the boundaries of the 2D list.

### Code Implementation

Here’s the implementation following the outline above:



```python
class Solution:
    def updateBoard(self, board: List[List[str]], click: List[int]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Directions for checking all 8 adjacent cells
        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
                      (0, -1),         (0, 1),
                      (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
        
        row, col = click
        
        # Helper function to count mines around a given cell
        def countMines(r, c):
            count = 0
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < len(board) and 0 <= nc < len(board[0]) and board[nr][nc] == 'M':
                    count += 1
            return count
        
        # Recursive function to reveal cells
        def reveal(r, c):
            if board[r][c] != 'E':  # If not an unrevealed square
                return
            
            mines_count = countMines(r, c)
            if mines_count > 0:
                board[r][c] = str(mines_count)  # Set to the number of adjacent mines
            else:
                board[r][c] = 'B'  # Set to revealed blank
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < len(board) and 0 <= nc < len(board[0]):
                        reveal(nr, nc)  # Recursively reveal adjacent squares

        # Handle the click
        if board[row][col] == 'M':
            board[row][col] = 'X'  # Mine hit
        else:
            reveal(row, col)  # Reveal the clicked square

        return board

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Directions**: The eight possible directions to check for adjacent mines are cached in `directions`.
- **`countMines` Function**: This function checks all adjacent cells to count how many mines surround a given cell.
- **`reveal` Function**: This function modifies the state of the board recursively based on the number of adjacent mines found.
- **Click Handling**: We check the state of the clicked cell and call `reveal` or mark it as 'X' based on the game's rules.

This solution is organized, works under the constraints provided, and ensures that the Minesweeper rules are followed correctly. You can directly use this code in a LeetCode environment.

# 531. Lonely Pixel I

### Problem Description 
Given an `m x n` `picture` consisting of black `'B'` and white `'W'` pixels, return the number of black lonely pixels.

A black lonely pixel is a character `'B'` that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.


Example 1:
Input: picture = [["W","W","B"],["W","B","W"],["B","W","W"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: All the three 'B's are black lonely pixels.


Example 2:
Input: picture = [["B","B","B"],["B","B","B"],["B","B","B"]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`m == picture.length`
`n == picture[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 500`
`picture[i][j]` is `'W'` or `'B'`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting black lonely pixels in a 2D picture represented as a grid, we'll approach it step-by-step while ensuring our solution fits within the LeetCode framework. Here’s a breakdown of how to implement it:

### Explanation

1. **Understanding Lonely Pixels**: A black pixel (`'B'`) is considered lonely if there are no other black pixels in its row and no other black pixels in its column.

2. **Plan**:
    - First, we will count the number of black pixels in each row and in each column.
    - Next, we will iterate through each pixel in the grid. If we find a black pixel, we will check if its row count and column count of black pixels are both equal to 1. If both counts are equal to 1, we increment our lonely pixel count.

3. **Time Complexity**: The solution should be efficient, ideally O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns since we need to traverse the grid and the counts.

### Implementation

Below is the complete Python code written in a format suitable for LeetCode submission:



```python
class Solution:
    def blackLonelyPixels(self, picture: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not picture or not picture[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(picture), len(picture[0])
        
        # Step 1: Count black pixels in each row and each column.
        row_counts = [0] * m
        col_counts = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if picture[i][j] == 'B':
                    row_counts[i] += 1
                    col_counts[j] += 1
        
        # Step 2: Count lonely black pixels
        lonely_pixel_count = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if picture[i][j] == 'B' and row_counts[i] == 1 and col_counts[j] == 1:
                    lonely_pixel_count += 1
        
        return lonely_pixel_count

```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the `picture` is not empty. It then initializes two lists, `row_counts` and `col_counts`, to store the counts of black pixels for each row and column.

2. **Counting Black Pixels**: We iterate through the `picture` using two nested loops. If a pixel is `'B'`, we increment the respective row and column counts.

3. **Identifying Lonely Pixels**: After counting, we loop through the grid again. For every black pixel found, we check if both its row and column counts are 1, indicating that it is a lonely pixel. If so, we increment the `lonely_pixel_count`.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the count of lonely black pixels.

This solution is efficient and leverages clear data structures to maintain counts, making it easy to understand the results after scanning the grid twice.

# 538. Convert BST to Greater Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Note: This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

Example 2:
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,0,2]
Output: [3,3,2]

Example 4:
Input: root = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [7,9,4,10]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.

`-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
All the values in the tree are unique.

`root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of converting a Binary Search Tree (BST) into a Greater Tree, we can utilize the property of BST and perform a reverse in-order traversal of the tree. During this traversal, we can keep track of the cumulative sum of all the nodes we have visited so far. This allows us to update each node's value to the required sum of its original value plus all values greater than it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Reverse In-Order Traversal**: A reverse in-order traversal processes the right subtree first, then the current node, and finally the left subtree. This ensures that we visit the larger nodes before the smaller ones.

2. **Maintain a Cumulative Sum**: We will maintain a variable that keeps track of the sum of all values that have been processed so far. Initially, this sum is zero.

3. **Update Node Values**: For each node visited during the traversal, we update its value by adding the current cumulative sum to it, and then we also update the cumulative sum to include this node's original value.

4. **Base Case for Recursion**: We leverage a recursive approach where the base case is when we reach a null node.

Now, let’s implement this in Python following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def convertBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # This will hold the running sum of node values
        self.running_sum = 0

        def reverse_in_order(node: TreeNode):
            if not node:
                return
            # Traverse the right subtree first (greater values)
            reverse_in_order(node.right)
            # Update the running sum and the current node value
            self.running_sum += node.val
            node.val = self.running_sum
            # Traverse the left subtree (smaller values)
            reverse_in_order(node.left)
        
        # Start the reverse in-order traversal from the root
        reverse_in_order(root)
        return root

```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- **TreeNode Class**: This is a basic definition for a node in the binary tree, where each node has a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).
  
- **Solution Class**: Contains the main method `convertBST` which initializes a running sum and starts the recursive traversal with `reverse_in_order`.

- **Recursive Helper Function `reverse_in_order`**: 
  - If the node is null, we return immediately (base case).
  - We first call the function on the node's right child (to process greater values).
  - We update `self.running_sum` by adding the current node's value to it and then setting the current node's value to `self.running_sum`.
  - Finally, we call the function on the node's left child to continue processing.

This Python code will create a Greater Tree from the given BST and respond to the constraints mentioned in the problem statement efficiently. The time complexity of this approach is O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree, and it uses O(H) space for the recursion stack in the worst case, where H is the height of the tree.

# 542. 01 Matrix

### Problem Description 
Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.


Example 1: 
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]
Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Example 2: 
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]
Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]
Note:
The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.

There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.

The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the distance of the nearest zero for each cell in a given binary matrix, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The idea behind BFS is that we can start from all the '0' cells and explore each cell's neighbors, allowing us to determine the minimum distance to a '0' for each cell efficiently.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Create a result matrix of the same dimensions as the input matrix filled with a default value (e.g., `inf` for "infinity") to indicate that the distance is initially unknown.

2. **Queue for BFS**: Use a deque (double-ended queue) to facilitate the BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of '0' cells and set their distances to 0 in the result matrix since the distance from '0' to itself is 0.

3. **BFS Traversal**: Iteratively dequeue cells from the queue, check their four possible adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), and update their distances if a shorter path to a '0' is found. If the distance is updated, enqueue that cell for further exploration. 

4. **Return Result**: After processing all reachable cells, the result matrix will contain the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest zero.

### Python Code
Here’s the Python code that follows the above approach which can be directly run on LeetCode:



```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not matrix:
            return []

        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        result = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        queue = deque()

        # Step 1: Initialize the result matrix and the queue with positions of all 0s
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    result[i][j] = 0
                    queue.append((i, j))

        # Directions for up, down, left, right movement
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

        # Step 2: BFS traversal
        while queue:
            x, y = queue.popleft()
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                # Check if the new position is valid
                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols:
                    # If this new cell can be updated to a smaller distance
                    if result[nx][ny] > result[x][y] + 1:
                        result[nx][ny] = result[x][y] + 1
                        queue.append((nx, ny))

        return result

```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Matrix Initialization**: We create a `result` matrix with dimensions equal to the input `matrix` and initialize it with `float('inf')`. This will hold the minimum distances to the nearest zero for each cell.

2. **Queue Setup**: We initialize a queue with all the coordinates of the cells that contain '0' and set their distance in `result` to 0. Each `0` cell is a starting point for our BFS traversal.

3. **BFS Loop**: The BFS continues until there are no more cells in the queue. For each cell dequeued, we examine its neighbors in four possible directions. If the distance to a neighboring cell can be updated (i.e., if the current cell's distance + 1 is less than the neighbor's current distance), we update it and enqueue that cell for further distance calculations.

4. **Output Result**: Finally, after processing all cells, the `result` matrix is returned which contains the distance of the nearest zero for each cell in the input matrix.

This approach ensures that we only traverse each cell a limited number of times, yielding a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the given matrix, making it efficient even for larger matrices.

# 546. Remove Boxes

### Problem Description 
You are given several `boxes` with different colors represented by different positive numbers.

You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (i.e., composed of `k` boxes, `k >= 1`), remove them and get `k * k` points.

Return the maximum points you can get.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]
Output: 23
Explanation:
[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [] (2*2=4 points)

Example 2:
Input: boxes = [1,1,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:
Input: boxes = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= boxes.length <= 100`
`1 <= boxes[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing points from removing boxes of colors, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The core idea is to consider every subarray of boxes and calculate the maximum points obtainable by removing boxes in an optimal way.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a 3D DP table `dp[l][r][k]` where:
   - `l` is the left index of the current subarray of boxes.
   - `r` is the right index of the current subarray of boxes.
   - `k` is the number of boxes with the same color as the box at index `r` that could be added to the end of this subarray.

2. **Base Case**: When `l > r`, the score is 0 because there are no boxes left. When `l == r`, the only box left gives us `1 * 1 = 1`.

3. **Recursive Case**: To compute the value of `dp[l][r][k]`, you have two main options:
   - Consider removing the last box (`boxes[r]`), and thus gain `k + 1` (the current count of same-colored boxes from the left merged with the one we're removing) and recursively calculating the optimal score for the remaining boxes.
   - Merge boxes of the same color at the end (`boxes[r]`) by checking places where previous boxes of the same color exist in the interval `[l, r-1]`.

4. **Transition**: The transitions will involve trying to find boxes that can be merged with `boxes[r]` and calculating:
   - `1 + dp[l][j][k-1] + dp[j+1][r-1][0]` for valid `j` where `boxes[j] == boxes[r]`.

5. **Final Computation**: The result will be stored in `dp[0][n-1][0]`, where `n` is the length of the boxes array.

### Complete Python Code:

Here is the full implementation in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def removeBoxes(self, boxes: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(boxes)
        # dp[l][r][k] means the maximum points we can get from boxes[l:r] 
        # with k boxes of the same color as boxes[r] attached to the right.
        dp = [[[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        for l in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for r in range(l, n):
                # Calculate the maximum points we can get for boxes[l:r]
                k = 0
                # Count `k` for same-colored boxes (boxes[r])
                for i in range(r, l - 1, -1):
                    if boxes[i] == boxes[r]:
                        k += 1
                        if i == r:
                            dp[l][r][k] = (k * k) + (dp[l][i - 1][0] if i > 0 else 0)
                        else:
                            dp[l][r][k] = max(dp[l][r][k], dp[l][i - 1][0] + dp[i][r - 1][k])
        
        return dp[0][n - 1][0]

```

### How to Run:

1. You can copy the above code and paste it into a new Python file or directly into the LeetCode editor.
2. Ensure you have the proper list input format when calling `removeBoxes`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\) due to the three nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\) for the DP table to store maximum points for various subproblems.

This approach guarantees an optimal solution by checking all possible ways to remove and combine boxes efficiently.

# 547. Number of Provinces

### Problem Description 
There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.


Example 1:
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 200`
`n == isConnected.length`
`n == isConnected[i].length`
`isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.

`isConnected[i][i] == 1`
`isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of provinces represented in an `n x n` connection matrix, we can leverage the graph representation of the cities. Each city is a node, and an edge exists between nodes (or cities) if they are connected, represented by `isConnected[i][j] = 1`.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Understanding Provinces**: A province is a group of cities that are connected directly or indirectly. Hence, we need to traverse the connections and group cities that belong together.
  
2. **Graph Traversal**: We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all the connected cities starting from any given city. Each time we run a DFS/BFS from an unvisited city, we find a new province.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize an array to keep track of visited cities.
   - Loop through each city. If it hasn't been visited, initiate a DFS/BFS which marks all reachable cities as visited.
   - Count each invocation of DFS/BFS as discovering a new province.

### Code Implementation
Here we implement the solution using DFS:



```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)
        visited = [False] * n
        
        def dfs(city):
            for neighbor in range(n):
                if isConnected[city][neighbor] == 1 and not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    dfs(neighbor)  # Visit connected city
        
        province_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:  # If the city is not visited, it's a new province
                visited[i] = True  # Mark the city as visited
                dfs(i)  # Start DFS/BFS
                province_count += 1  # Increment the province count
        
        return province_count

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The function `findCircleNum` takes a matrix `isConnected` as input.
2. **Initialization**: We determine the number of cities (`n`) and create a `visited` list initialized to `False`, indicating that no city has been visited initially.
3. **DFS Function**: The inner function `dfs(city)` checks all neighbors (other cities) of the current city. For each unvisited neighbor that is directly connected (`isConnected[city][neighbor] == 1`), it marks that neighbor as visited and calls itself recursively.
4. **Province Counting**: We iterate through all cities:
   - If a city hasn't been visited, we increment the `province_count` (indicating a new province) and invoke `dfs` from that city.
5. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the total number of provinces counted.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) because we traverse an `n x n` matrix.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) due to the `visited` list and the recursive call stack.

This solution follows the required format for LeetCode submissions and can be run directly on the website.

# 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5

Constraints:
The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

The total number of nodes is between `[0, 104]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum depth of an n-ary tree, we can utilize a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach. The core idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root and keep track of the depth as we go deeper. When we reach a leaf node (a node with no children), we can then compare the current depth with our maximum depth recorded so far.

Below is the implementation of the solution in Python, following the LeetCode format:

### Python Code:



```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Node) -> int:
        # Base case: if the node is None, return depth as 0
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize the depth
        max_depth = 0
        
        # Traverse through each child (DFS)
        for child in root.children:
            max_depth = max(max_depth, self.maxDepth(child))
        
        # Add 1 to include the depth of the current node
        return max_depth + 1

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Node Definition**: 
   - The `Node` class represents each node in the n-ary tree, which contains a value (`val`) and a list of children (`children`).

2. **Solution Class**:
   - We define a `Solution` class which contains the method `maxDepth`.

3. **Function Signature**:
   - `def maxDepth(self, root: Node) -> int:`: This function takes a `Node` instance `root` as input, representing the root of the n-ary tree, and returns an integer representing the maximum depth.

4. **Base Case**:
   - If the `root` is `None`, it means the tree is empty, so we return a depth of `0`.

5. **Initialization**:
   - We create a variable `max_depth` to keep track of the maximum depth found during our traversal.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - We iterate through each child of the current node using a for loop. For each child, we call `maxDepth` recursively.
   - We compute the depth for each child and keep track of the maximum depth found so far by taking the maximum value between `max_depth` and the depth returned from the recursive call.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - After exploring all the children, we add `1` to the `max_depth` to account for the current node itself.

8. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, we return the computed `max_depth + 1`, which represents the maximum depth from the root to the farthest leaf node.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack in the worst case.

This solution should effectively solve the problem when run on the LeetCode platform.

# 563. Binary Tree Tilt

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.

The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if there the node does not have a right child.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15

Example 3:
Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 9

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.

`-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the tilt of a binary tree, we will use a post-order traversal approach. This means we will process the left and right children of a node before processing the node itself. The primary steps of our solution are as follows:

1. **Definition of Tilt**: The tilt of a node is computed as the absolute difference between the sum of values of its left subtree and the sum of values of its right subtree.
  
2. **Recursive Function**: We'll create a recursive function to traverse the tree. This function will:
   - Calculate the sum of all the node values in the subtree rooted at the current node.
   - Calculate the tilt of the current node and add it to a global variable that totals up the tilt values.

3. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, we simply return a sum of `0`.

Now let's see the complete Python code structured in a format suitable for submission on LeetCode:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def findTilt(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.total_tilt = 0  # Variable to keep track of the total tilt

        def post_order(node: TreeNode) -> int:
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            # Recursively find the sum of value in the left and right subtree
            left_sum = post_order(node.left)
            right_sum = post_order(node.right)

            # Calculate the tilt for the current node
            current_tilt = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
            self.total_tilt += current_tilt  # Add current tilt to the total tilt

            # Return the sum of the values
            return left_sum + right_sum + node.val
        
        post_order(root)  # Start the post-order traversal from the root
        return self.total_tilt  # Return the computed total tilt

```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class**: 
   - This is a standard class definition for the binary tree node that includes the value (`val`) and pointers to the left and right children (`left`, `right`).

2. **Solution Class & findTilt Method**:
   - In the `findTilt` method, we initialize `self.total_tilt` to keep track of the cumulative tilt as we traverse the tree.
   - We define a nested helper function `post_order`, which performs the post-order traversal.

3. **Post-order Traversal**:
   - Inside `post_order`, we first check if the current `node` is `None`. If it is, we return `0` (base case).
   - We recursively calculate the sums of the left and right subtrees.
   - We compute the tilt for the current node as the absolute difference between the two sums and add it to `self.total_tilt`.
   - Finally, we return the total sum of the current subtree including the current node's value.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After we finish traversing, we return the total tilt by accessing `self.total_tilt`.

This solution has a time complexity of \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is \(O(H)\) due to the recursion stack, where \(H\) is the height of the tree. 

This code can be directly entered into the LeetCode platform to solve the problem efficiently.

# 576. Out of Boundary Paths

### Problem Description 
There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the ball, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
Output: 6
Explanation:

Example 2:
Input: m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
Output: 12
Explanation:
Note:
Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.

The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].

N is in range [0,50].

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the number of unique ways a ball can move out of a grid boundary within a given number of moves, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a detailed explanation of the approach and the corresponding Python code.

### Explanation

1. **Problem Understanding**:  
   We have a grid of size `m x n` and we can start moving a ball from the coordinate `(i, j)`. The ball can move to adjacent cells or cross the grid boundary in four possible directions (up, down, left, right).

2. **Exit Conditions**:  
   If the ball moves out of the grid boundary, that's considered a successful exit. Our task is to count all possible paths to exit the grid within a maximum of `N` moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:  
   We define a 3D DP table `dp[steps][x][y]` where `steps` represents the number of moves taken, and `(x, y)` represents the current position of the ball on the grid. The value `dp[steps][x][y]` will hold the count of ways to reach position `(x, y)` with exactly `steps` moves.

4. **Base Case**:  
   If we start with 0 moves (`steps = 0`), we're at the starting position `(i, j)`, hence:
   - `dp[0][i][j] = 1`

5. **Transition**:  
   For each position `(x, y)`, and for each number of moves from `1` to `N`, we calculate the ways to move to that position from all adjacent positions. The ways to exit the grid can also be counted from those positions that hit the boundary.

6. **Boundary Condition**:  
   Moving out of the boundary means we have a successful path, so we need to take care of counting these successful moves correctly.

7. **Final Count**:  
   The result will be the sum of ways to reach the boundary cells after `N` moves.

### Python Code

Here's the complete code following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def findPaths(self, m: int, n: int, N: int, i: int, j: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        # Initialize a 3D DP array with zero
        dp = [[[0] * n for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        
        # Base case: the starting position
        dp[0][i][j] = 1
        
        # Directions for up, down, left, right
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        
        # Iterate over moves from 0 to N-1 (because we will calculate based on previous state)
        for steps in range(N):
            for x in range(m):
                for y in range(n):
                    if dp[steps][x][y] > 0:  # Only process if there are ways to reach (x,y)
                        # Explore all 4 directions
                        for dx, dy in directions:
                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n:
                                dp[steps + 1][nx][ny] = (dp[steps + 1][nx][ny] + dp[steps][x][y]) % MOD
                            else:
                                # Ball goes out of bounds
                                dp[steps + 1][0][0] = (dp[steps + 1][0][0] + dp[steps][x][y]) % MOD
                                
        # Count all paths that successfully exited the grid after exactly N moves
        result = 0
        for x in range(m):
            for y in range(n):
                if x == 0 or x == m - 1 or y == 0 or y == n - 1:
                    result = (result + dp[N][x][y]) % MOD
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of Code:
- We define a 3D list `dp` to keep track of the number of ways to reach each grid cell at each step.
- We initialize the starting position and then iterate through each step.
- For each cell that has paths leading to it, we propagate those paths to neighboring cells.
- If moving to a neighboring cell takes the ball out of the grid boundary, we increment the count of successful exits.
- Finally, we sum the counts of pathways that reach any edge cell after `N` steps and return the result.

This approach efficiently counts the paths while remaining within specified constraints and uses dynamic programming to avoid recalculating states, thus ensuring performance.

# 638. Shopping Offers

### Problem Description 
In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.

However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy for each item.

The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.

Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.

You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.


Example 1:
Input: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: 
There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.


Example 2:
Input: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.

Note:
There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.

For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.

You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to find the lowest price to purchase a specific quantity of items considering both the regular prices and the special offers provided. We can use a backtracking approach to explore all combinations of purchasing regular items or utilizing special offers.

The main idea is to define a recursive function that calculates the minimum cost for a given state of items we need to purchase. This function will check if we can use any of the special offers and will recursively call itself after applying the offer. If we decide not to use any offers, we will simply calculate the total cost based on the regular prices.

Here's the code structured according to the LeetCode format, which includes defining a class and a method named `shoppingOffers`. We'll also include comments for more clarity.



```python
class Solution:
    def shoppingOffers(self, price, special, needs):
        self.price = price
        self.special = special
        self.needs = needs
        
        # Start solving from the initial needs
        return self.helper(tuple(needs))
    
    def helper(self, needs):
        # If there are no items left to buy, the cost is 0
        if all(n == 0 for n in needs):
            return 0
        
        # Calculate the cost without using any special offers
        min_cost = sum(p * n for p, n in zip(self.price, needs))
        
        # Try using each special offer
        for offer in self.special:
            # Generate new needs after applying the special offer
            new_needs = []
            for i in range(len(needs)):
                new_need = needs[i] - offer[i]
                # If we are buying more than we need, we cannot use this offer
                if new_need < 0:
                    break
                new_needs.append(new_need)
            else:  # This else corresponds to the for loop, which executes if no break occurs
                # Calculate the cost of applying this special offer
                cost_with_offer = offer[-1] + self.helper(tuple(new_needs))
                # Update min_cost if we find a better cost with an offer
                min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_with_offer)
        
        return min_cost

# Example usages:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.shoppingOffers([2, 5], [[3, 0, 5], [1, 2, 10]], [3, 2]))  # Output: 14
print(sol.shoppingOffers([2, 3, 4], [[1, 1, 0, 4], [2, 2, 1, 9]], [1, 2, 1]))  # Output: 11

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a `Solution` class as required by the LeetCode platform.

2. **Main Function (`shoppingOffers`)**: This method serves as an entry point for the solution:
   - It initializes class variables to store prices, special offers, and the needs.
   - It calls the helper method starting with the tuple form of needs.

3. **Helper Function (`helper`)**:
   - **Base Case**: If all items in `needs` are zero, this means we have finished buying everything, and the cost is `0`.
   - **Calculating `min_cost` without special offers**: We calculate the cost by multiplying the price of each item by its respective needed quantity.
   - **Iterate through special offers**: For each offer, we attempt to apply it:
     - We calculate the `new_needs` after applying the offer and ensure we aren't purchasing more items than needed.
     - If applicable, we compute the total cost incorporating the special offer and call `helper` recursively with updated needs.
   - Finally, we return the minimal cost found.

This solution effectively explores all combinations of regular purchases and special offers to find the lowest price while ensuring that we do not exceed the required quantities. The use of recursion and backtracking allows for a comprehensive examination of all possibilities.

# 664. Strange Printer

### Problem Description 
There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:
The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.

At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.


Example 1:
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".


Example 2:
Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.

Hint: Length of the given string will not exceed 100.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of the strange printer, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to define a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from index `i` to index `j` (inclusive). 

### Problem Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - If there's only one character in the substring, it requires one turn:
     - `dp[i][i] = 1` for any valid `i`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - We can print the substring `s[i:j]` in one go if `s[i]` and `s[j]` are the same. In that case, we can combine the printing of the outer characters with the result of printing the inner substring, potentially reducing the number of turns needed.
   - For any substring ranging from index `i` to `j`, we can consider different positions `k` where we can split the substring into two parts:
     - `s[i:k]` and `s[k+1:j]`. The formula will be:
       - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then:
         \[
         dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
         \]
       - Otherwise:
         \[
         dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]) \text{ for all } k \text{ in } [i, j-1]
         \]

3. **Final Result**:
   - The answer for the entire string `s` will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string.

### Python Implementation:

Here's how you would implement this solution in Python, following the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def strangePrinter(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        
        # dp[i][j] will hold the minimum number of turns to print s[i:j]
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Base case: When we have one character, we need one turn to print it
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1  # Only one character, needs one turn
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1  # end of the substring
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1  # worst case: print one by one
                for k in range(i, j):
                    if s[k] == s[j]:  # Optimize if characters match
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j - 1])
        
        return dp[0][n - 1]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. We first get the length of the string `s`.
2. We initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` keeps track of the minimum number of turns required to print the substring `s[i:j]`.
3. We fill in the base cases where `dp[i][i] = 1` because a single character can be printed in one turn.
4. We then iterate over increasing substring lengths, filling the DP table according to our transition rules.
5. Finally, we return `dp[0][n-1]`, which contains the result for the entire string.

This algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\), which is feasible given the problem constraints (the string length can be at most 100).

You can run this code directly on LeetCode where the problem is defined.

# 679. 24 Game

### Problem Description 
You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9.  You need to judge whether they could operated through `*`, `/`, `+`, `-`, `(`, `)` to get the value of 24.


Example 1:
Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24

Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: False
Note:
The division operator `/` represents real division, not integer division.  For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.

Every operation done is between two numbers.  In particular, we cannot use `-` as a unary operator.  For example, with `[1, 1, 1, 1]` as input, the expression `-1 - 1 - 1 - 1` is not allowed.

You cannot concatenate numbers together.  For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, we cannot write this as 12 + 12.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining whether four cards with numbers can be used to reach the value of 24 through the given operations, we can utilize a recursive backtracking approach. The key idea is to explore all possible combinations of operations and parenthesis arrangements that can form different expressions.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Operations**: We can use addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) to combine the numbers. 

2. **Permutations of Numbers**: Since the order of operations affects the result, we will need to try out all permutations of the card values.

3. **Combining Values**: We will recursively combine two values at a time using all four operations, reducing the number of cards from four to three, then from three to two, and finally from two to one (the desired value of 24).

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Generate all permutations of the card numbers.
   - Implement a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and checks if it can be reduced to 24 using the defined operations.
   - For each pair of numbers, apply each operation and recurse with the new list of numbers until only one number (the result) is left.

5. **Edge Cases**: We need to ensure that we handle division by zero properly.

Here is how this can be implemented in Python, following the format commonly used for LeetCode submissions:



```python
from itertools import permutations

class Solution:
    def judgePoint24(self, cards):
        def valid_operations(a, b):
            return [
                a + b,
                a - b,
                b - a,
                a * b,
                a / b if b != 0 else None,
                b / a if a != 0 else None
            ]
        
        def can_make_24(numbers):
            if len(numbers) == 1:
                return abs(numbers[0] - 24) < 1e-6
        
            for i in range(len(numbers)):
                for j in range(len(numbers)):
                    if i != j:
                        # Choose two numbers to combine
                        new_numbers = [numbers[k] for k in range(len(numbers)) if k != i and k != j]
                        for result in valid_operations(numbers[i], numbers[j]):
                            if result is not None:
                                new_numbers.append(result)
                                if can_make_24(new_numbers):
                                    return True
                                new_numbers.pop()  # backtrack
            return False

        # Check all permutations of the input cards
        for perm in permutations(cards):
            if can_make_24(list(perm)):
                return True
            
        return False

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.judgePoint24([4, 1, 8, 7]))  # Output: True
# print(sol.judgePoint24([1, 2, 1, 2]))  # Output: False

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Imports**: We import `permutations` from `itertools` to handle different orders of the cards efficiently.
- **valid_operations Function**: This function calculates all valid results from applying the four operations on two numbers, returning a list of results.
- **can_make_24 Function**: This function checks if a given list of numbers can be reduced to 24. It recursively picks two numbers, combines them using valid operations, and reduces the list until only one number remains.
- **Main Function `judgePoint24`**: This function generates all permutations of the input `cards` and checks if any permutation can lead to 24 by using the recursive function `can_make_24`.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity can be expressive as it involves permutations and recursive branching, making it feasible for small inputs like four numbers (which is always the case based on constraints).

By using recursion and permutations, we can effectively explore all possible ways to compute the value 24 with the given four card numbers.

# 685. Redundant Connection II

### Problem Description 
In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `n`), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[ui, vi]` that represents a directed edge connecting nodes `ui` and `vi`, where `ui` is a parent of child `vi`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.


Example 1:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]
Output: [4,1]

Constraints:
`n == edges.length`
`3 <= n <= 1000`
`edges[i].length == 2`
`1 <= ui, vi <= n`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding an edge to remove to restore a rooted tree from a directed graph with one added edge, we need to identify the cycle introduced by this edge. A rooted tree requires that there is exactly one parent for each node except for the root node. Therefore, if any node has more than one incoming edge, we can infer that an edge is causing a cycle.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Initialize Structures**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the number of parents (incoming edges) for each node.
   - Create a set or list to keep track of edges.

2. **Count Incoming Edges**:
   - Traverse through the given edges, and for each edge `[u, v]`, increment the count of parents for node `v`.

3. **Identify the Edge to Remove**:
   - As we traverse the edges again, we check which node has more than one inbound edge. The first such edge that connects to this node will be a candidate for removal.
   - Since we want to return the last such edge in case of multiple candidates, we keep track of it while iterating.

4. **Return the Edge**: 
   - After determining which edge creates the cycle, return the last occurrence of this edge.

### Python Code

Here’s the implementation based on the above steps:



```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantDirectedEdge(self, edges):
        parent_count = {}
        last_edge = None
        
        for u, v in edges:
            # Count incoming edges for node v
            if v in parent_count:
                parent_count[v] += 1
            else:
                parent_count[v] = 1
            
            # Store the current edge for later reference
            last_edge = (u, v)
        
        for u, v in reversed(edges):
            if parent_count[v] > 1:
                # Found an edge that can be removed
                return [u, v]
        
        # Fallback (should not get here)
        return last_edge

# Example usage:
# edges1 = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
# edges2 = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 1], [1, 5]]
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.findRedundantDirectedEdge(edges1))  # Output: [2, 3]
# print(sol.findRedundantDirectedEdge(edges2))  # Output: [4, 1]

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Counting Incoming Edges**: 
   - We create a dictionary `parent_count` to keep track of how many edges point to each node (incoming edges).
   - For each edge `[u, v]`, we update `parent_count[v]`.

2. **Finding the Redundant Edge**:
   - We traverse the edges in reverse order to ensure that if multiple edges are found that could be candidates for removal, we get the last one.
   - As we look through the edges, if we find that `parent_count[v]` is greater than 1, it means there is a cycle, and we return the edge `[u, v]`.

### Performance
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of edges since we go through the list twice: once for counting and once for checking cycles.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the graph structure in `parent_count`.

This solution is efficient and maintains clarity while directly addressing the problem on the LeetCode platform as required.

# 690. Employee Importance

### Problem Description 
You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, their importance value and their direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.


Example 1:
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

Note:
One employee has at most one direct leader and may have several subordinates.

The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the total importance value for a given employee and their subordinates, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here, I will demonstrate the DFS approach, which is effective for traversing the hierarchy of employees.

The basic idea is to:
1. Build a mapping of employee IDs to their corresponding information (importance and subordinates) for quick access.
2. Implement a recursive DFS function that sums the importance of an employee and all their subordinates.
3. Return the computed total importance for the given starting employee.

### Python Implementation

Below is the Python code following the LeetCode submission format:



```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id: int, importance: int, subordinates: list[int]):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.subordinates = subordinates

class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees: list[Employee], id: int) -> int:
        # Create a mapping from employee ID to employee object
        employee_map = {employee.id: employee for employee in employees}

        # Define a recursive DFS function to calculate total importance
        def dfs(emp_id: int) -> int:
            # Get the employee object
            employee = employee_map[emp_id]
            # Initialize total importance with the current employee's importance
            total_importance = employee.importance
            # Add the importance of all subordinates
            for sub in employee.subordinates:
                total_importance += dfs(sub)
            return total_importance

        # Start the DFS from the given employee id
        return dfs(id)

# Example usage:
# employees = [Employee(1, 5, [2, 3]), Employee(2, 3, []), Employee(3, 3, [])]
# s = Solution()
# print(s.getImportance(employees, 1)) # Output: 11

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Employee Class**: We define a class `Employee` that represents an employee's information. It has three attributes:
   - `id`: unique identifier for the employee.
   - `importance`: the importance value of the employee.
   - `subordinates`: a list of ids representing direct subordinates of the employee.

2. **Solution Class**: The main solution is implemented in the `Solution` class which contains the method `getImportance`.
   - **Employee Mapping**: We use a dictionary comprehension to create a mapping from employee ids to their corresponding `Employee` objects for quick lookup.
   - **DFS Function**: We define a helper function `dfs` that takes an employee id and:
     - Retrieves the employee object from the map.
     - Initializes the total importance with the employee's importance.
     - Recursively calls itself for each of the employee's subordinates to accumulate their preferences.
   - Finally, we call the `dfs` function starting from the given employee id and return its result.

### Usage
To use this solution, create instances of `Employee` and pass them to the `Solution.getImportance` method along with the employee ID for which you want to calculate the total importance. The provided example demonstrates this.

This DFS approach effectively and efficiently computes the required total importance, handling the constraints provided in the problem statement. It ensures we account for all levels of subordinates recursively.

# 694. Number of Distinct Islands

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected) to equal the other.


Example 1:
11000
11000
00011
00011
Given the above grid map, return `1`.


Example 2:
11011
10000
00001
11011
Given the above grid map, return `3`.

Notice that:
11
1
and
 1
11
are considered different island shapes, because we do not consider reflection / rotation.

Note:
The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting distinct islands in a 2D grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to explore each island. We will track each island's shape in a canonical form, so we can easily determine if two islands are the same.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Grid**: Each '1' in the grid represents land, and '0' represents water. Islands are groups of '1's that are horizontally or vertically connected.

2. **Canonical Representation**: To compare whether two islands are the same, we will derive a unique representation for each island based on its shape as it can be translated but not rotated or reflected. This will be a list of coordinates (relative to a starting point).

3. **Traversal with DFS**: We will apply a DFS to traverse the grid to find all parts of an island. As we explore, we will record the relative coordinates of each '1' found.

4. **Using a Set to Track Shapes**: We will use a set to track the unique representations of the islands we find.

5. **Implementation**: We will iterate through each cell in the grid. If we encounter a '1', we will initiate a DFS to collect its shape and add that shape to the set.

Here is the Python code implementing this solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinctIslands(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        unique_islands = set()
        
        def dfs(x, y, origin_x, origin_y, shape):
            # Mark the cell as visited
            visited.add((x, y))
            # Record the shape relative to the origin
            shape.append((x - origin_x, y - origin_y))
            
            # Explore all four directions
            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
                if (0 <= new_x < n and 0 <= new_y < m and
                    (new_x, new_y) not in visited and
                    grid[new_x][new_y] == 1):
                    dfs(new_x, new_y, origin_x, origin_y, shape)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
                    shape = []
                    dfs(i, j, i, j, shape)
                    unique_islands.add(tuple(shape))
        
        return len(unique_islands)

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:

- We define a function `numDistinctIslands` that takes a 2D grid as input.
- We check if the grid is empty; if it is, we return 0.
- We set up variables to keep track of the dimensions of the grid, a set to track visited cells, and another set to store unique island shapes.
- The nested `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to explore connected '1's starting from the first '1' found. It keeps a shape list that records the coordinates relative to the starting point of the island.
- In the main loop, we iterate through each cell in the grid. If we find a '1' that hasn't been visited, we start the DFS from there to determine the island shape and add its representation to the `unique_islands` set.
- Finally, we return the size of the `unique_islands` set, which gives the number of distinct islands.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid, since each cell is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * m) for the visited set and shape representations in the worst case.

This solution efficiently counts the number of distinct islands as specified in the problem statement.

# 695. Max Area of Island

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

Example 1:
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.


Example 2:
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Given the above grid, return `0`.

Note: The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in a 2D binary grid, where `1` represents land and `0` represents water, we can utilize a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The main idea is to traverse the grid, and whenever we find a `1`, we will initiate a DFS to calculate the area of the island (group of connected `1`s) starting from that point. We will keep track of the maximum area found during our traversal.

### Steps:
1. Define a function `maxAreaOfIsland` that accepts the grid as input.
2. Create a helper function `dfs` to explore the island and count its area.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum area.
4. Loop through each cell in the grid:
   - When a cell contains a `1`, call the `dfs` function and update the maximum area.
5. Finally, return the maximum area found.

### Code:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid):
        if not grid:
            return 0

        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        max_area = 0
        
        # Directions for moving in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

        def dfs(r, c):
            # If out of bounds or at a cell that is water (0), return 0
            if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == 0:
                return 0
            
            # Mark the cell as visited by setting it to 0 (water)
            grid[r][c] = 0
            
            # Start the area count with this cell
            area = 1
            
            # Explore all four directions
            for dr, dc in directions:
                area += dfs(r + dr, c + dc)
            
            return area

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:  # Found a new island
                    # Calculate the area of this island and update max_area
                    current_area = dfs(i, j)
                    max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

        return max_area

```

### Explanation:
- The main function `maxAreaOfIsland` starts by checking if the grid is empty. If it is, we return `0` as the area.
- We define the `directions` for traversal, allowing movement up, down, left, and right.
- The `dfs` function is defined to handle the depth-first search. It takes the current row and column as parameters and performs the following:
  - Base case checks for out-of-bounds and whether the cell is water (`0`). If it is, we return `0`.
  - If we reach a `1`, we mark it as visited by setting it to `0` and initialize the area count for this island as `1`.
  - We then call `dfs` for each of the four directions and add the resulting areas to get the total area of the island.
- In the outer loop nested over each cell, we check for land (`1`). When found, we call `dfs` and compute the island's area, updating `max_area` accordingly.
- After traversing the grid, we return the `max_area`, which is the maximum area of all found islands.

This code follows the conventions used in LeetCode, and it will run directly on the LeetCode platform without modifications.

# 711. Number of Distinct Islands II

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after rotation (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or reflection (left/right direction or up/down direction).


Example 1:
11000
10000
00001
00011
Given the above grid map, return `1`.

Notice that:
11
1
and
 1
11
are considered same island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.


Example 2:
11100
10001
01001
01110
Given the above grid map, return `2`.

Here are the two distinct islands:
111
1
and
1
1
Notice that:
111
1
and
1
111
are considered same island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the up/down direction, then they have the same shapes.

Note:
The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of distinct islands in a grid, we will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach combined with string representation of the islands. This allows us to capture the unique shapes of islands and compare them after applying all possible transformations (rotations and reflections). 

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation followed by the code that can be directly run on the LeetCode platform:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Input Representation**: We will have a 2D grid that consists of `0`s (water) and `1`s (land). Each group of connected `1`s represents an island.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will use DFS to explore and collect the coordinates of each island. Starting from a `1`, we will traverse all connected `1`s in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

3. **Normalizing Shapes**: Once we get the coordinates of an island, we will transform these coordinates into a normalized shape. This shape will then be represented in a string format, allowing easy comparison.

4. **Generating Transformations**: We need to consider all possible transformations of the shapes (rotations and reflections). After forming a representation of a shape, we will also generate:
    - 90-degree rotation
    - 180-degree rotation
    - 270-degree rotation
    - Reflection (horizontal)
    - Reflection (vertical)

5. **Tracking Unique Shapes**: We will use a set to keep track of distinct island shapes. Each time we identify a new island and its shapes, we insert them into the set.

6. **Count Distinct Islands**: Finally, the size of the set will give us the count of distinct islands.

### Python Code Implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinctIslands(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(r: int, c: int, base_r: int, base_c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
            """ Perform DFS to get the shape of the island. """
            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= len(grid) or c >= len(grid[0]) or grid[r][c] == 0:
                return []

            grid[r][c] = 0  # Mark as visited
            shape = [(r - base_r, c - base_c)]  # Store relative position to the starting point
            
            # Explore all four directions
            shape.extend(dfs(r + 1, c, base_r, base_c))
            shape.extend(dfs(r - 1, c, base_r, base_c))
            shape.extend(dfs(r, c + 1, base_r, base_c))
            shape.extend(dfs(r, c - 1, base_r, base_c))

            return shape

        def normalize(shape: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> str:
            """ Normalize the shape by generating all transformations. """
            transforms = []

            shape = sorted(shape)  # Sort to standardize the orientation

            # Create all rotations and reflections
            for flip in [False, True]:  # With or without flipping
                for rotate in range(4):  # 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees
                    if flip:
                        current = [(x, -y) for x, y in shape]
                    else:
                        current = shape
                    
                    if rotate == 1:
                        current = [(y, -x) for x, y in current]
                    elif rotate == 2:
                        current = [(-x, -y) for x, y in current]
                    elif rotate == 3:
                        current = [(-y, x) for x, y in current]

                    transforms.append(tuple(sorted(current)))  # Add the transformed tuple
            
            # Return the lexicographically smallest shape representation
            return min(transforms)

        unique_shapes = set()

        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:  # Found unvisited island part
                    shape = dfs(r, c, r, c)
                    normalized_shape = normalize(shape)
                    unique_shapes.add(normalized_shape)  # Add the unique shape representation

        return len(unique_shapes)

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a `Solution` class containing a method `numDistinctIslands`.
- We perform depth-first search to collect the shape of each island relative to its starting point.
- We normalize shapes to account for different transformations.
- We store unique shapes in a set and return its size as the result.

By using this approach, we effectively count all distinct island formations from the given grid. This solution efficiently handles the constraints and will perform well within the limits provided by the problem.

# 721. Accounts Merge

### Problem Description 
Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.


Example 1:
Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".

The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.

We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.


Example 2:
Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]

Constraints:
`1 <= accounts.length <= 1000`
`2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10`
`1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 30`
`accounts[i][0]` consists of English letters.

`accounts[i][j] (for j > 0)` is a valid email.

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem of merging accounts based on shared emails, we can leverage graph traversal techniques. The accounts can be considered as nodes in a graph where emails are edges connecting these nodes. The main idea is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all connected components of emails associated with each account, effectively merging accounts that share at least one email.

Here's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Graph Representation**: We'll use a dictionary to represent our graph where each email points to a set of other emails that it is connected to.

2. **Building the Graph**: As we iterate through each account, we'll create edges in our graph for every pair of emails in the same account.

3. **DFS Traversal**: We'll perform a DFS for each email to gather all emails that are connected to it. This will help us determine all accounts that have common emails.

4. **Result Construction**: After retrieving all connected emails for each account, we'll sort the emails and prepend the name from the original account. Finally, these results will be accumulated and returned.

This approach is efficient and takes advantage of depth-first searching, making it suitable for the given constraints.

Here's the Python code implementing the above logic, formatted according to LeetCode standards:



```python
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        from collections import defaultdict

        # Step 1: Build the graph
        email_graph = defaultdict(set)
        email_to_name = {}

        for account in accounts:
            name = account[0]
            for email in account[1:]:
                email_graph[account[1]].add(email)
                email_graph[email].add(account[1])
                email_to_name[email] = name

        # Step 2: Perform DFS to collect connected emails
        def dfs(email, visited):
            visited.add(email)
            merged_emails = [email]
            for neighbor in email_graph[email]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    merged_emails.extend(dfs(neighbor, visited))
            return merged_emails

        visited = set()
        merged_accounts = []

        for email in email_to_name.keys():
            if email not in visited:
                # Collect all connected emails
                collected_emails = dfs(email, visited)
                # Sort the emails and add the account entry
                merged_accounts.append([email_to_name[email]] + sorted(collected_emails))

        return merged_accounts

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We begin by importing `defaultdict` from `collections` for convenient graph representation.
- We define a method `accountsMerge` in the `Solution` class, which takes a list of accounts as input.
- We construct our `email_graph` where each email is an edge to other emails within the same account. We also maintain a dictionary `email_to_name` to remember the name corresponding to each email.
- A helper function `dfs` is defined to recursively explore all connected emails and collect them.
- We keep track of visited emails using a `set` called `visited`.
- Finally, for each email that has not been visited, we perform a DFS to gather all connected emails, sort them, and prepend the person's name to form the final merged account.
- The final result is returned as a list of lists.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + E), where N is the number of accounts and E is the number of edges (emails connections). Since each email appears only once in the graph, the total processing involves linear relationship bounds.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for the graph representation, where V is the number of unique emails.

This solution efficiently handles the merging of accounts based on shared emails and meets the constraints provided.

# 733. Flood Fill

### Problem Description 
An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on.  Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

At the end, return the modified image.


Example 1:
Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.

Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.

Note:
The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.

The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length` and `0 <= sc < image[0].length`.

The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and `newColor` will be an integer in `[0, 65535]`.

### Solution 
 Here’s a Python solution to the flood fill problem, which you can run directly on the LeetCode website. The solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the connected pixels and fill them with the new color.



```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, newColor: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Get the original color at the starting pixel
        originalColor = image[sr][sc]
        
        # If the new color is the same as the original color, return the image as is
        if originalColor == newColor:
            return image
        
        # Define the DFS function to explore the connected pixels
        def dfs(r, c):
            # Check if the current pixel is out of bounds or does not match the original color
            if r < 0 or r >= len(image) or c < 0 or c >= len(image[0]) or image[r][c] != originalColor:
                return
            
            # Change the color of the current pixel to the new color
            image[r][c] = newColor
            
            # Explore the North, South, East, and West directions
            dfs(r + 1, c)  # down
            dfs(r - 1, c)  # up
            dfs(r, c + 1)  # right
            dfs(r, c - 1)  # left
        
        # Start DFS from the starting pixel
        dfs(sr, sc)
        
        return image

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - We define a method `floodFill` within a `Solution` class, as required by LeetCode.

2. **Parameters**:
   - The `image` parameter is a 2D list containing the pixel values.
   - `sr` and `sc` are the starting pixel's row and column coordinates.
   - `newColor` is the color that we need to apply in the flood fill process.

3. **Retrieving Original Color**:
   - We first check the color of the starting pixel (`originalColor`) so that we can compare it later when traversing the image.

4. **Handling the Edge Case**:
   - If the `originalColor` is the same as `newColor`, we simply return the image as no changes are necessary.

5. **DFS Function**:
   - We define a nested function `dfs(r, c)` that performs a depth-first traversal starting from the pixel at row `r` and column `c`.
   - Inside this function:
     - We check if the current pixel (`r, c`) is out of bounds or if its color does not match the `originalColor`. If either condition is true, we return (end this path of exploration).
     - We change the current pixel's color to `newColor`.
     - Then we recursively call `dfs` on the four possible directions: down, up, right, and left.

6. **Starting the Flood Fill**:
   - We call the `dfs` function starting from the coordinates `(sr, sc)`.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   - After completing the flood fill process, we return the modified image.

### Example Run:
For the given input example:



```python
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1
sc = 1
newColor = 2

```

The output would be:



```python
[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

```

The code effectively replaces all pixels connected to (1, 1) with the new color `2`, demonstrating the flood fill process.

# 737. Sentence Similarity II

### Problem Description 
Given two sentences `words1, words2` (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs `pairs`, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, `words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"]` and `words2 = ["fine", "drama", "talent"]` are similar, if the similar word pairs are `pairs = [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]`.

Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if "great" and "good" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, then "great" and "fine" are similar.

Similarity is also symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like `words1 = ["great"]` can never be similar to `words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]`.

Note:
The length of `words1` and `words2` will not exceed `1000`.

The length of `pairs` will not exceed `2000`.

The length of each `pairs[i]` will be `2`.

The length of each `words[i]` and `pairs[i][j]` will be in the range `[1, 20]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if two sentences are similar based on the given pairs of similar words, we can use a graph-based approach. We'll represent the words as nodes and the pairs as undirected edges between those nodes in a graph. This approach is useful because it allows us to easily find connected components (groups of similar words) using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Check Lengths**: First, we need to verify that both sentences have the same number of words. If not, they cannot be similar.

2. **Build Graph**: Next, we'll build a graph using the given pairs. Each word in a pair will form an undirected edge in the graph.

3. **Find Connected Components**: To find all similar words, we can use either DFS or BFS to explore the graph. We'll keep track of which words are similar by storing them in a set.

4. **Compare Words**: Finally, we will compare each corresponding pair of words from `words1` and `words2` to check if they are either the same or if they belong to the same connected component in the graph.

Here is the Python code that implements this logic in LeetCode format:



```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str], pairs: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Check if both sentences have the same length
        if len(words1) != len(words2):
            return False
        
        # Step 2: Build the graph with similar word pairs
        graph = defaultdict(set)
        for word1, word2 in pairs:
            graph[word1].add(word2)
            graph[word2].add(word1)
        
        # Step 3: Define a function to find all similar words using DFS
        def dfs(word, visited):
            stack = [word]
            connected = set()
            while stack:
                current = stack.pop()
                if current not in visited:
                    visited.add(current)
                    connected.add(current)
                    for neighbor in graph[current]:
                        if neighbor not in visited:
                            stack.append(neighbor)
            return connected
        
        # Step 4: Check each pair of corresponding words
        visited = set()
        for w1, w2 in zip(words1, words2):
            if w1 == w2:  # If words are the same, continue
                continue
            
            if w1 in visited and w2 in visited:  # Both words are visited
                if w1 not in graph or w2 not in graph or w1 not in graph[w2]:
                    return False
            
            elif w1 in visited:
                similar_words = dfs(w1, visited)
                if w2 not in similar_words:
                    return False
            
            elif w2 in visited:
                similar_words = dfs(w2, visited)
                if w1 not in similar_words:
                    return False
            
            else:
                similar_words = dfs(w1, visited)
                if w2 not in similar_words:
                    return False
        
        return True

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Checking Lengths**: The code first checks if the lengths of `words1` and `words2` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.

2. **Building the Graph**: We use a `defaultdict` to represent our graph. Each word points to a set of other words it is similar to, creating an undirected connection.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function traverses the graph to gather all connected similar words starting from a given word. It uses a stack to implement the DFS iteratively.

4. **Comparing Each Pair**: We loop through pairs of words from both sentences. If the words are identical, we move on. If they are different, we look for their connections in the graph. If they aren't connected and both words have been visited, we return `False`. If one of the words has been visited, we check if the other is in the connected component discovered by DFS.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, if all checks pass, the function returns `True`, indicating that the sentences are similar.

This solution is efficient and should handle the constraints provided in the problem.

# 743. Network Delay Time

### Problem Description 
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= n <= 100`
`1 <= times.length <= 6000`
`times[i].length == 3`
`1 <= ui, vi <= n`
`ui != vi`
`0 <= wi <= 100`
All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the time it takes for a signal to reach all nodes in a directed network, we can utilize Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is efficient for finding the shortest paths in graphs with non-negative weights and is ideal for our use case where we have travel times represented as directed edges.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to implementing the solution:

1. **Graph Representation**: We will represent the directed graph using an adjacency list, which will allow us to efficiently access the neighbors of each node.

2. **Data Structures**: We will use a priority queue (min-heap) to always explore the node with the smallest travel time next. This helps to ensure that we explore paths in the shortest first manner.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Start from the node `k` (the source of the signal).
   - Use a distance array initialized to infinity to store the shortest time to reach each node, except for the starting node which will be zero.
   - Continuously extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue and update the distances to its neighbors.
   - If a shorter path to a neighbor is found, update its distance and push it into the priority queue.
   
4. **Output the Result**: After processing all reachable nodes, we check the maximum time stored in the distance array. If any node remains unreachable (i.e., has a distance of infinity), we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the maximum time.

Here is the complete Python code following the LeetCode submission format:



```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Build the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the distance array and priority queue
        distance = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        distance[k] = 0
        min_heap = [(0, k)]  # (time, node)
        
        # Step 3: Dijkstra's algorithm
        while min_heap:
            current_time, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

            if current_time > distance[node]:
                continue

            for neighbor, travel_time in graph[node]:
                new_time = current_time + travel_time
                if new_time < distance[neighbor]:
                    distance[neighbor] = new_time
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_time, neighbor))
        
        # Step 4: Calculate the result
        max_time = max(distance[1:])  # Ignore index 0 as nodes are 1-indexed
        return max_time if max_time != float('inf') else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Graph Construction**: We use a `defaultdict` to create an adjacency list representation of the graph where each node points to a list of tuples containing its neighbors and the corresponding travel times.

2. **Distance Initialization**: We use a list initialized to infinity for all nodes, but the distance to the starting node `k` is set to `0`.

3. **Min-Heap Logic**: We extract the node with the smallest current distance from the heap. For each neighbor of the current node, if we find a shorter path compared to what was previously known, we update the neighbor's distance and add it back into the heap for further exploration.

4. **Final Step**: After the completion of the algorithm, we check the maximum distance in our distance list. If any node remains unreachable (infinity distance), we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the maximum time as it represents the longest time it takes for the signal to reach all nodes.

This implementation is efficient enough given the problem constraints and will run within the provided limits on LeetCode.

# 749. Contain Virus

### Problem Description 
A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.

The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where `0` represents uninfected cells, and `1` represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.

Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.

Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.


Example 1:
Input: grid = 
[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
There are 2 contaminated regions.

On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:
[[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]
On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.


Example 2:
Input: grid = 
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.

Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.


Example 3:
Input: grid = 
[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
 [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.

Note:
The number of rows and columns of `grid` will each be in the range `[1, 50]`.

Each `grid[i][j]` will be either `0` or `1`.

Throughout the described process, there is always a contiguous viral region that will infect strictly more uncontaminated squares in the next round.

### Solution 
 Here's a solution for the problem described, which can be run directly on LeetCode. The solution implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to track the spread of the virus, count the walls needed to contain each infected area, and determine which region poses the greatest threat to uninfected cells.



```python
class Solution:
    def containVirus(self, grid):
        # Directions for moving in the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        # Function to perform BFS and get the walls needed for a region
        def bfs(i, j):
            queue = [(i, j)]
            infected_cells = [(i, j)]
            walls = 0
            threat_count = 0
            visited.add((i, j))
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.pop(0)
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]):
                        if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                            if grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                                visited.add((nx, ny))
                                queue.append((nx, ny))
                                infected_cells.append((nx, ny))
                            elif grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                                threat_count += 1
                                walls += 1
            
            return threat_count, walls, infected_cells

        total_walls = 0
        while True:
            regions = []
            max_threat = 0
            for i in range(len(grid)):
                for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                    if grid[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
                        threat_count, walls, infected_cells = bfs(i, j)
                        if threat_count > max_threat:
                            max_threat = threat_count
                            regions = [(walls, infected_cells)]
                        elif threat_count == max_threat:
                            regions.append((walls, infected_cells))

                break
            
            # Quarantine the region that poses the highest threat
            total_walls += regions[0][0]
            for walls, infected_cells in regions:
                for x, y in infected_cells:
                    # If it's the most threatening region, we keep track of its cells
                    grid[x][y] = 2
                for x, y in infected_cells:
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                            grid[nx][ny] = 1
        
            # Reset visited for the next iteration
            visited = set()
        
        return total_walls

# Example for testing
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.containVirus([[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
#                          [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
#                          [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
#                          [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]))  # Output: 10

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Directions**: We define the 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for exploring adjacent cells.

2. **BFS Function**: The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search starting from an infected cell:
   - It uses a queue to process nodes (infected cells) and checks their neighbors.
   - For each infected cell, it counts how many uninfected cells it threatens and how many walls are required to isolate it from those threatened cells.
   - It also collects all cells that belong to the current infected region.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop continues as long as there's a threat to uninfected cells from infected regions.
   - For each cell in the grid, it identifies the infected cells and calculates the `threat_count`, the number of `walls`, and keeps track of the region cells (infected).
   - It determines which region poses the greatest threat (the region that can infect the most uninfected cells).
   - Once the most threatening region is found, it counts the walls needed to contain that region and marks the viral cells accordingly.
   - It then updates the grid by allowing the virus to spread from neighboring infected cells.

4. **Termination**: The process continues until there are no remaining threats; at that point, the function returns the total number of walls built.

This approach effectively simulates the quarantine process and calculates the required walls while adhering to the BFS strategy for flood filling and infection spreading.

# 753. Cracking the Safe

### Problem Description 
There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be one of the first `k` digits `0, 1, ..., k-1`.

While entering a password, the last `n` digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is `"345"`, if you type `"012345"`, the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of minimum length that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "01"
Note: "10" will be accepted too.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "00110"
Note: "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.

Note:
`n` will be in the range `[1, 4]`.

`k` will be in the range `[1, 10]`.

`k^n` will be at most `4096`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of generating a minimal-length password that guarantees unlocking the box, we can leverage the concept of De Bruijn sequences. A De Bruijn sequence for a given alphabet and length generates every possible sequence of a particular length exactly once. Therefore, by generating such a sequence for our digits, we can ensure that every possible password of length `n` appears as a suffix.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - You need to generate a sequence that contains every possible combination of `n` digits (ranging from `0` to `k-1`).
   - The last `n` digits of any input should match a valid combination from our generated sequence.

2. **De Bruijn Sequence**:
   - A De Bruijn sequence for an alphabet of size `k` and subsequences of length `n` will contain all possible combinations of `n` length digits, and it can be generated in a way that it wraps around.
   - The length of the De Bruijn sequence for the alphabet of size `k` and subsequence length `n` is `k^n + n - 1`. The last `n-1` digits are repeated from the beginning to allow for continuation checks.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Implement a recursive method to generate the De Bruijn sequence.
   - Use a set to keep track of which combinations of digits have been seen.
   - Once we have a valid sequence, format it accordingly to return.

### Python Code:
Here’s the implementation based on the description:



```python
class Solution:
    def crackSafe(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize required variables
        visited = set()  # to keep track of visited sequences
        result = []      # to accumulate the result

        # Backtracking helper function to generate the sequences
        def backtrack(current):
            # Visit each combination of the last n-digits
            for digit in range(k):
                # Generate the new sequence
                next_seq = current + str(digit)
                # Check if the sequence of length n has been visited
                if next_seq not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_seq)  # mark the n-length sequence as visited
                    backtrack(next_seq[1:])  # move one character ahead
                    result.append(str(digit))  # append the digit to the result

        # Start the backtracking with an initial sequence of '0' * (n-1)
        initial = '0' * n
        backtrack(initial)
        # Combine the initial sequence with result to create the final De Bruijn sequence
        return ''.join(result) + ''.join(str(i) for i in range(k))

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.crackSafe(2, 2))  # Example input

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a set `visited` to keep track of combinations we have encountered and a list `result` to store the final password digits.
   
2. **Backtracking**:
   - The `backtrack` function tries to append each digit from `0` to `k-1` to the current sequence.
   - If appending a digit results in a new unique sequence of length `n` that has not been visited yet, it gets added to the `visited` set.
   - We recursively call `backtrack`, trimming the sequence to maintain a length of `n`.
   - Each time a valid next sequence is created, the last digit which was just added is appended to the `result`.

3. **Final Combination**:
   - After completing the backtracking process, we concatenate the result list into a string and return it.

This solution ensures that the generated password will encompass every possible `n`-length suffix, thus guaranteeing that the box can be opened with a valid password.

# 756. Pyramid Transition Matrix

### Problem Description 
We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one-letter string.

We are allowed to place any color block `C` on top of two adjacent blocks of colors `A` and `B`, if and only if `ABC` is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of `bottom`, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples `allowed`. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length `3`.

Return `true` if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise `false`.


Example 1:
Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG","CDE","GEA","FFF"]
Output: true
Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  G   E
 / \ / \
B   C   D
We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.


Example 2:
Input: bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA","AAB","ABA","ABB","BAC"]
Output: false
Explanation:
We cannot stack the pyramid to the top.

Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.


Constraints:
`2 <= bottom.length <= 8`
`0 <= allowed.length <= 200`
`allowed[i].length == 3`
The letters in all input strings are from the set `{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}`.

### Solution 
 To solve the pyramid stacking problem, we need to check if we can build a pyramid from the bottom string `bottom` using allowed triples of characters defined in the `allowed` list. We can recursively check all possibilities to build smaller pyramids until we reach the top.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Understanding the Structure**: We can place a block on top of two adjacent blocks if they form a valid allowed triple. For each consecutive pair of blocks in the current row, if we can find a corresponding third block that can be placed on top, we create a new row.

2. **Recursive Approach**: We can use recursion to explore whether we can construct a valid pyramid:
   - Start at the bottom row.
   - For each adjacent pair of blocks in the current row, check all allowed triples that can be formed.
   - For valid triples, generate a new row and continue checking if this new row can reach the top.

3. **Memoization**: To optimize our solution and avoid redundant calculations, we can use a memoization dictionary that stores previously computed results for specific rows.

Here’s the Python code that implements this approach in the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def pyramidTransition(self, bottom: str, allowed: List[str]) -> bool:
        # Create a set of allowed triples for quick lookup
        allowed_set = set(allowed)

        # Helper function to check if we can build the pyramid from a given row
        def canBuild(cur_row):
            if len(cur_row) == 1:
                return True  # If we have a single block left, we've built the pyramid successfully

            # Look for possible colors for the new row
            next_row = []
            for i in range(len(cur_row) - 1):
                found = False
                for c in range(65, 91):  # ASCII codes for 'A' to 'Z'
                    block = chr(c)
                    if f"{cur_row[i]}{cur_row[i + 1]}{block}" in allowed_set:
                        found = True
                        next_row.append(block)
                if not found:
                    return False  # If no block can be placed above the current pair, pyramid can't be built
            
            # Recursively check if we can build the pyramid from the new row
            return canBuild("".join(next_row))

        return canBuild(bottom)

```

### Code Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We first convert the list of allowed triples into a set for quick lookup. 

2. **Recursive Function `canBuild`**:
   - Base Case: If the current row has only one block (a single character), we return `True` since we have successfully built the pyramid.
   - We then iterate through each adjacent pair of blocks in `cur_row` and check all possible characters (from 'A' to 'Z') for placement above them.
   - If we find a valid character that could be placed using an allowed triple, we add it to `next_row`.
   - If, after checking all pairs, we didn't find any valid ways to build the next row, we return `False`.
   - Finally, we recursively call `canBuild` on the constructed `next_row`.

3. **Return Statement**: The result of the recursive function is returned as the final output.

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: The solution's complexity depends on the number of valid triples relative to the input size. Given the constraints, this is efficient.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursive stack when building the pyramid.

This implementation adheres to the requirements of being runnable directly on LeetCode.

# 778. Swim in Rising Water

### Problem Description 
On an N x N `grid`, each square `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i,j)`.

Now rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square `(0, 0)`. What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square `(N-1, N-1)`?

Example 1:
Input: [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time `0`, you are in grid location `(0, 0)`.

You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point `(1, 1)` until time `3`.

When the depth of water is `3`, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.


Example 2:
Input: [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation:
 0  1  2  3  4
24 23 22 21  5
12 13 14 15 16
11 17 18 19 20
10  9  8  7  6
The final route is marked in bold.

We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

Note:
`2 <= N <= 50`.

grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of swimming across an N x N grid while considering elevation limits, we can make use of a priority queue (min-heap) in combination with a breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm approach. This way, we can efficiently determine the least time required to swim from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Grid Representation**: Each cell in the grid contains an elevation that limits the swimming ability based on the water depth `t`. You can only swim into cells where the elevation does not exceed `t`.

2. **Swim Mechanism**: From any cell `(i, j)`, we can swim to its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) as long as we stay within the grid boundaries and the elevation of the target cell does not exceed `t`.

3. **Objective**: We are required to find the minimum time (or water depth) `t` such that a path exists from `(0, 0)` to `(N-1, N-1)`.

### Approach:

1. **Priority Queue Initialization**: Use a priority queue to explore the grid based on the current water depth. Start from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` with its elevation.
  
2. **Visited Tracking**: Keep track of visited cells to avoid processing them multiple times.

3. **BFS-like Expansion**: For each cell, expand to its adjacent cells, and only push those into the priority queue if their elevation is ≤ current depth `t`.

4. **Result Extraction**: The first time we reach the bottom-right corner, the current depth will be our answer.

### Implementation:

Below is the Python code that implements this approach in the format suitable for LeetCode submissions:



```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid):
        N = len(grid)
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up
        min_heap = []
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (grid[0][0], 0, 0))  # Starting with elevation at (0, 0)
        visited = set()
        visited.add((0, 0))
        
        while min_heap:
            water_depth, x, y = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # If we reached the bottom-right corner
            if x == N - 1 and y == N - 1:
                return water_depth
            
            # Explore the adjacent cells
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                
                # Continue if out of bounds
                if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nx, ny))
                    # Push the maximum elevation among cells that can be visited
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (max(water_depth, grid[nx][ny]), nx, ny))

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Data Structures**: 
   - A min-heap is used to always expand the least water depth path first.
   - A set (`visited`) keeps track of cells we've already processed to prevent revisiting.

2. **Main Loop**: 
   - We continually pop the cell with the smallest `water_depth` from the heap and check if it's the bottom-right cell.
   - If it's not, we explore each of its four neighbors, checking if they're within bounds and not already visited. We push the maximum of the current water depth and the neighbor's elevation to ensure the swim remains valid.

3. **Output**: When the bottom-right corner is reached, the current water depth is returned as the final answer.

This solution efficiently finds the least time required to swim across the grid while ensuring that we only visit valid elevations. The time complexity primarily depends on the grid size and the priority queue operations.

# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Note: This question is the same as 530: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 105`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST), we can take advantage of the properties of BSTs. In a BST, the in-order traversal gives us the values of nodes in a sorted order. Thus, to find the minimum difference, we can:

1. Perform an in-order traversal to collect the values of the nodes.
2. Calculate the differences between consecutive values in this sorted list and track the minimum difference.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **In-order Traversal**: We will traverse the BST in in-order fashion, which means we first visit the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree. During this traversal, we will collect the values of the nodes in a list.
  
2. **Calculate Minimum Difference**: After collecting the sorted values from the in-order traversal, we will iterate through the list and find the minimum absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements.

### Implementation:

Here’s how we can implement this solution in Python, following the LeetCode submission guidelines.



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # This variable will hold the previous value during the in-order traversal
        self.prev = -1
        # To hold the minimum difference we can find
        self.min_diff = float('inf')

        # Helper function for in-order traversal
        def in_order_traversal(node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Traverse the left subtree
            in_order_traversal(node.left)
            
            # If prev value is not -1, calculate difference
            if self.prev != -1:
                self.min_diff = min(self.min_diff, node.val - self.prev)
            
            # Update the previous value to the current node's value
            self.prev = node.val
            
            # Traverse the right subtree
            in_order_traversal(node.right)
        
        # Start in-order traversal
        in_order_traversal(root)
        
        return self.min_diff

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This class defines the structure of each node in the binary tree which contains a value, a pointer to its left child, and a pointer to its right child.

2. **Solution Class**: This class implements the desired method `getMinimumDifference`.
   
3. **Variables**:
   - `self.prev` is initialized to -1, which helps us identify the first node we visit during in-order traversal.
   - `self.min_diff` is initialized to infinity to ensure that any valid difference will be smaller.

4. **In-Order Traversal**: The `in_order_traversal` function:
   - Recursively visits the left child, processes the current node, and then visits the right child.
   - When processing the current node, if `self.prev` is not -1 (meaning we have already seen a node), we calculate the difference between the current node's value and `self.prev`. The minimum of these differences is stored in `self.min_diff`.
   - The `self.prev` value is updated after processing each node, so it always holds the last processed node’s value.

5. **Return Statement**: After completing the in-order traversal, we return `self.min_diff`, which contains the smallest difference found.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack during the in-order traversal. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this can be O(N).

This implementation is efficient and runs well within the constraints provided. You can copy this code directly into the LeetCode platform and it should work correctly.

# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

### Problem Description 
There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:
There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).

There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).

If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).

The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.


Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.


Constraints:
`graph.length == n`
`1 <= n <= 100`
`0 <= graph[u].length < n`
`0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1`
`graph[u]` does not contain `u`.

All the values of `graph[u]` are unique.

If `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.

### Solution 
 To determine whether a given undirected graph is bipartite, we can use a graph traversal approach. Specifically, we can utilize BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) to check if we can color the graph using two colors. If we can successfully color the graph without any adjacent nodes having the same color, then the graph is bipartite.

### Approach
1. **Color Initialization**: We will keep an array called `color` to track the color assigned to each node. We'll use two colors represented as 1 and -1.
2. **BFS or DFS Traversal**: 
   - For each unvisited node, start a BFS or DFS traversal.
   - Color the starting node with one color.
   - Alternate the color for the adjacent nodes.
   - If we ever encounter a situation where two adjacent nodes have the same color, we can immediately conclude that the graph is not bipartite.
3. **Multiple Components**: Since the graph might not be connected, we need to ensure that we check all nodes, hence run the BFS/DFS for each unvisited node.

### Implementation
The following code implements the above approach using BFS:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        n = len(graph)
        color = [0] * n  # 0 means unvisited, 1 means color A, -1 means color B
        
        def bfs(start):
            queue = deque([start])
            color[start] = 1  # Starting node colored with 1
            
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if color[neighbor] == 0:  # Not colored yet
                        color[neighbor] = -color[node]  # Alternate colors
                        queue.append(neighbor)
                    elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:  # Same color conflict
                        return False
            
            return True
            
        for i in range(n):
            if color[i] == 0:  # Not visited
                if not bfs(i):  # Start BFS for component
                    return False
                    
        return True

```

### Explanation
- **Data Structure**: We use a `deque` for the BFS queue to ensure efficient popping of elements from the front.
- **Color Representation**: The `color` array is initialized with 0 (uncolored). As we traverse and color nodes, we assign them 1 or -1.
- **BFS Function**: The `bfs` function takes a starting node and attempts to color the graph component connected to it. If a conflict arises (meaning two adjacent nodes have the same color), we return `False` immediately.
- **Outer Loop**: We iterate over all nodes in case there are multiple disconnected components.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges (since we traverse each node and edge once).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the coloring array.

This code can be directly run in the LeetCode environment under the "Bipartite Graph" problem, and it satisfies all constraints provided.

# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

### Problem Description 
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `n` nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.


Example 2:
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]

Example 3:
Input: graph = [[1],[]]
Output: [[0,1]]

Example 4:
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,2,3],[0,3]]

Example 5:
Input: graph = [[1,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,3]]

Constraints:
`n == graph.length`
`2 <= n <= 15`
`0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
`graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).

The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to explore each path starting from node `0` and keep track of the path taken until we reach the destination node `n - 1`. 

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the approach we will take:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We will use a recursive DFS function to explore all possible paths from the current node to the target node.
  
2. **Path Tracking:** As we visit nodes, we will maintain a list that keeps track of the current path. When we reach the target node, we will add the current path to our results.

3. **Backtracking:** After exploring all paths from the current node, we will backtrack by removing the last visited node from the path list so that we can explore other paths correctly.

4. **Base Case:** If we reach the target node, we will store the current path in the result list.

5. **Handling the Result:** At the end of the DFS, we will return the list of all found paths.

Now, let's implement this solution in Python as per the LeetCode solution format:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def dfs(node: int, path: List[int]):
            # If we reach the end node, append the path to results
            if node == len(graph) - 1:
                result.append(path.copy())
                return
            
            # Explore each adjacent node
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                path.append(neighbor)  # Include the neighbor in the path
                dfs(neighbor, path)    # Recursively go to the next node
                path.pop()             # Backtrack: remove the neighbor from the path

        result = []               # To store all paths
        dfs(0, [0])              # Start DFS from node 0 with initial path [0]
        return result            # Return all found paths

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.allPathsSourceTarget([[1,2],[3],[3],[]]))
# Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Class Definition:** We define a class `Solution` which contains the method `allPathsSourceTarget`.
  
- **DFS Function:** Inside this method, we define the inner function `dfs` which takes two parameters: the current node (`node`) and the current path (`path`).

- **Base Condition:** When the current node equals `n - 1`, we add a copy of the current path to the result list.

- **Exploration:** We iterate over the neighbors of the current node, adding each neighbor to the path and calling the `dfs` function recursively with the neighbor as the new current node. 

- **Backtracking:** After the recursive call, we remove the neighbor from the path using the `pop()` method, allowing us to explore other potential paths correctly.

- **Result Storage:** We initialize `result` as an empty list to store all valid paths.

- **Invocation of DFS:** We start the DFS from node `0`, initializing the path with `[0]`.

This code will work efficiently within the given constraints and return all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` as required. The implementation is tailored to be directly runnable on LeetCode, following the specified input and output formats.

# 802. Find Eventual Safe States

### Problem Description 
We start at some node in a directed graph, and every turn, we walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a terminal node (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

We define a starting node to be safe if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there is a natural number `k`, so that we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `k` steps for any choice of where to walk.

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

The directed graph has `n` nodes with labels from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `graph`. The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph, going from node `i` to node `j`.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.


Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]

Constraints:
`n == graph.length`
`1 <= n <= 104`
`0 <= graph[i].legnth <= n`
`graph[i]` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

The graph may contain self-loops.

The number of edges in the graph will be in the range `[1, 4 * 104]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of identifying "safe" nodes in a directed graph, we will leverage graph traversal techniques, particularly Depth-First Search (DFS) and Topological Sorting. The key idea is to ensure that any path we take from a starting node eventually leads us to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges).

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Graph Representation**: The input graph is represented as an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` contains the list of nodes that can be reached from node `i`.
  
2. **Terminal Nodes**: A terminal node is a node that has no outgoing edges. If we start from a terminal node, we immediately stop there.

3. **Safe Nodes**: A node is considered safe if all paths starting from it eventually lead to a terminal node.

### Approach

1. **Identify Terminal Nodes**: First, we identify all terminal nodes in the graph.
  
2. **Reverse Graph**: We create a reverse graph where edges point from the nodes back to their parent nodes. This allows us to use a reverse traversal (i.e., starting from terminal nodes and marking safe nodes).

3. **DFS Traversal**: Use a DFS approach or Kahn's algorithm (for topological sorting) to mark nodes as safe when they can reach a terminal node.

4. **Collect and Return Results**: After processing all nodes, we collect the indices of safe nodes and sort them before returning.

Here is the Python code using the approach outlined above, formatted to run directly on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(graph)
        out_degree = [0] * n
        reverse_graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Prepare the reverse graph and count outgoing edges
        for u in range(n):
            for v in graph[u]:
                reverse_graph[v].append(u)
                out_degree[u] += 1
        
        # Terminal nodes are initialized
        safe_nodes = []
        
        # Nodes are considered unsafe initially unless proven safe
        safe = [False] * n
        
        # Start from terminal nodes (nodes with no outgoing edges)
        terminal_nodes = [i for i in range(n) if out_degree[i] == 0]
        
        while terminal_nodes:
            node = terminal_nodes.pop()
            if not safe[node]:
                safe[node] = True
                safe_nodes.append(node)
                
                # Traverse the reverse edges
                for parent in reverse_graph[node]:
                    out_degree[parent] -= 1
                    # If this parent node now has no outgoing edges, it is safe as well
                    if out_degree[parent] == 0:
                        terminal_nodes.append(parent)
        
        # Sort the safe nodes before returning
        safe_nodes.sort()
        
        return safe_nodes

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Construction**: We first construct the reverse graph while counting the outgoing edges for each node using `out_degree`.

2. **Identification of Terminal Nodes**: We identify nodes with zero outgoing edges as terminal nodes.

3. **Traversal Logic**: We use a while loop to process terminal nodes:
   - If we find a terminal node that is not already marked safe, we mark it as safe and add it to our result list.
   - We then decrease the out-degree of all parent nodes connected to this terminal node and check if any of them become terminal (with zero outgoing edges). Those nodes are then added to the queue for further processing.

4. **Result Compilation**: Finally, after processing all nodes, we sort the list of safe nodes and return it.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges, since each node and edge is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + E) for the storage of the reverse graph and the out-degree count.

This approach effectively identifies all safe nodes in a directed graph using graph theory principles and is efficient in terms of both time and space.

# 827. Making A Large Island

### Problem Description 
You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. You are allowed to change at most one `0` to be `1`.

Return the size of the largest island in `grid` after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.


Constraints:
`n == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= n <= 500`
`grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution for the problem of finding the size of the largest island in a binary matrix after changing at most one `0` to `1`. The solution is formatted to run directly on LeetCode.

### Explanation of the Approach

1. **Understanding the Island Representation**: The matrix consists of 1s (land) and 0s (water). An island is formed by a group of 1s that are connected either vertically or horizontally.

2. **Identify Current Islands**: We will traverse the matrix using Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify the current islands and their sizes. Each island will be marked with a unique identifier (or index).

3. **Store Island Sizes**: As we traverse and identify islands, we will store the sizes of each island in a dictionary where the key is the island identifier and the value is the size of that island.

4. **Evaluate Potential Tile Changes**: For each `0` in the grid, we will consider changing it to `1`. To calculate the potential size of the new island formed by this change, we will look at the four adjacent cells. If the adjacent cells are part of different islands, we will sum their sizes and add `1` (for the newly turned `1`).

5. **Maximize the Island Size**: We will keep track of the maximum possible island size, considering the size of the largest island and any potential islands formed by changing a `0`.

6. **Return the Result**: After completing the traversal, we will return the maximum size obtained.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def largestIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        id_to_size = {}
        current_id = 2  # Start IDs from 2 as 0 and 1 are already used
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        # Function to perform DFS and count the size of the island
        def dfs(x, y, current_id):
            size = 1
            grid[x][y] = current_id  # Mark this cell with current island ID
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                    size += dfs(nx, ny, current_id)
            return size
        
        # Step 1: Identify all islands and calculate their sizes
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    island_size = dfs(i, j, current_id)
                    id_to_size[current_id] = island_size
                    current_id += 1
        
        # Step 2: Try changing one `0` to `1` and calculate the maximum possible island size
        max_size = max(id_to_size.values(), default=0)  # Get the size of the largest island initially
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 0:
                    seen_ids = set()
                    new_size = 1  # New island size starts with the newly changed `0` to `1`
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = i + dx, j + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] > 1:
                            island_id = grid[nx][ny]
                            if island_id not in seen_ids:
                                seen_ids.add(island_id)
                                new_size += id_to_size[island_id]
                    max_size = max(max_size, new_size)
        
        return max_size

```

### Explanation of the Code

- The class `Solution` contains a method `largestIsland`, which takes the binary grid as input.
- We use DFS to traverse the grid and mark islands with unique IDs while counting their sizes.
- We iterate through the grid again, checking where we can change `0`s to `1`s and calculating the potential new island size from adjacent islands.
- Finally, we return the maximum size of the island possible after the operation.

# 834. Sum of Distances in Tree

### Problem Description 
An undirected, connected tree with `N` nodes labelled `0...N-1` and `N-1` `edges` are given.

The `i`th edge connects nodes `edges[i][0] `and` edges[i][1]` together.

Return a list `ans`, where `ans[i]` is the sum of the distances between node `i` and all other nodes.


Example 1:
Input: N = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation: 
Here is a diagram of the given tree:
  0
 / \
1   2
   /|\
  3 4 5
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.  Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.

Note: `1 <= N <= 10000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of calculating the sum of distances between each node and all other nodes in an undirected tree, we can use a two-pass Depth First Search (DFS) approach. The overall strategy involves:

1. **Calculating the size of each subtree and initial distances** using a first DFS traversal. This gives us the distance sum for the root node.
2. **Using the information from the first DFS to calculate the distances for all other nodes** during the second DFS traversal.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown followed by the implementation:

### Step 1: Represent the Tree
We will represent the tree as an adjacency list using a dictionary. This allows us to easily traverse the tree.

### Step 2: First DFS Traversal
In the first DFS:
- We calculate the number of nodes in each subtree.
- We also compute the total distance sum from the root node (node 0) to all other nodes.

### Step 3: Second DFS Traversal
In the second DFS:
- We use the result from the first DFS to compute the sum of distances for each node based on its parent's distance and the sizes of its subtrees. 
- The relationship can be derived as:
  - If we know the distance sum for the parent node, we can derive it for the child node by considering how the movement changes when moving from the parent to the child.

### Python Implementation

Here is the Python code that implements the above logic:



```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def sumOfDistancesInTree(self, N: int, edges: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
        # Create adjacency list for the tree
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # To hold the number of nodes in each subtree
        size = [0] * N
        # To hold the sum of distances from the root (node 0)
        distance_sum = [0] * N
        
        # First DFS: to calculate sizes and initial distance_sum for node 0
        def dfs1(node, parent):
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:
                    dfs1(neighbor, node)
                    size[node] += size[neighbor]
                    distance_sum[node] += distance_sum[neighbor] + size[neighbor]
            size[node] += 1  # count itself

        # Second DFS: to calculate the distance_sum for all other nodes
        def dfs2(node, parent):
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:
                    # Transfer the distance sum calculated at node to neighbor
                    distance_sum[neighbor] = distance_sum[node] - (size[neighbor]) + (N - size[neighbor])
                    dfs2(neighbor, node)

        # Start the first DFS from the root node (0)
        dfs1(0, -1)
        # Start the second DFS to calculate distance sums for all nodes
        dfs2(0, -1)

        return distance_sum

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Construction**: A graph is built using an adjacency list representing the tree.
2. **First DFS (`dfs1`)**:
    - We recursively compute the size of each subtree and the initial distance sum from the root (node 0).
    - This initializes `size` and `distance_sum` for each node.
3. **Second DFS (`dfs2`)**:
    - This function updates the distance sum for each node based on its parent's distance sum.
    - The formula used takes into account how moving to the child changes the distance metrics.
4. **Return**: The output is the `distance_sum` which holds the calculated sum of distances for all the nodes.

This approach runs in O(N) time and is efficient for the given constraints (up to 10,000 nodes).

# 839. Similar String Groups

### Problem Description 
Two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of `X`, so that it equals `Y`. Also two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if they are equal.

For example, `"tars"` and `"rats"` are similar (swapping at positions `0` and `2`), and `"rats"` and `"arts"` are similar, but `"star"` is not similar to `"tars"`, `"rats"`, or `"arts"`.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: `{"tars", "rats", "arts"}` and `{"star"}`.  Notice that `"tars"` and `"arts"` are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list `strs` of strings where every string in `strs` is an anagram of every other string in `strs`. How many groups are there?

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`1 <= strs.length <= 300`
`1 <= strs[i].length <= 300`
`strs[i]` consists of lowercase letters only.

All words in `strs` have the same length and are anagrams of each other.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of groups of similar strings in a given list, we can follow a few straightforward steps. The key concept here is to identify which strings can be transformed into others by swapping two letters. 

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Understanding "Similarity":** 
   - Two strings are similar if they are identical or if swapping two distinct letters in one string can make it equal to the other string.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - Treat each string as a node in a graph. Two nodes (strings) are connected if the strings are similar based on our definition.

3. **Finding Connected Components:**
   - We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the graph. Each time we start a new search in our adjacency list, we can count it as a new group.

4. **Building the Adjacency List:**
   - For each pair of strings, we can check if they are similar. This can be done in O(n) time where n is the length of the strings. We will compare the characters and track their indices where they differ. If the number of differing positions is exactly two, and the characters can be swapped to match, we connect those strings in our graph.

### Implementation Plan:
- Use a nested loop to compare each string with every other string, building an adjacency list based on the similarity.
- Use DFS to traverse each component and count the number of unique groups.

Here’s the implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def numSimilarGroups(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        def are_similar(s1, s2):
            """Helper function to check if s1 and s2 are similar."""
            diff = []
            for i in range(len(s1)):
                if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                    diff.append((s1[i], s2[i]))
                if len(diff) > 2:  # More than 2 characters differ
                    return False
            # Exactly two characters should differ and they should be swappable
            return len(diff) == 2 and diff[0] == diff[1][::-1]

        def dfs(node, visited):
            """Perform DFS to explore all similar nodes."""
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    dfs(neighbor, visited)

        n = len(strs)
        graph = {i: [] for i in range(n)}  # Adjacency list
        
        # Building the graph
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if are_similar(strs[i], strs[j]):
                    graph[i].append(j)
                    graph[j].append(i)

        visited = set()
        num_groups = 0
        
        # Finding connected components using DFS
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                num_groups += 1
                dfs(i, visited)

        return num_groups

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `are_similar` function checks if two strings are similar based on the criteria specified (exact equality or swappable).
- The `dfs` function is a classic depth-first search implementation, marking nodes (strings) as visited.
- The main loop constructs the graph by checking every pair of strings for similarity and populates the adjacency list.
- Finally, we loop through all strings, performing a DFS whenever we find an unvisited string, incrementing the group count each time we find a new component.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the strings. This is due to the nested loops to compare each string pair and the character comparison within `are_similar`.
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the adjacency list.

This code can be directly submitted to LeetCode, and it should work as intended for the specified problem.

# 841. Keys and Rooms

### Problem Description 
There are `N` rooms and you start in room `0`.  Each room has a distinct number in `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 
Formally, each room `i` has a list of keys `rooms[i]`, and each key `rooms[i][j]` is an integer in `[0, 1, ..., N-1]` where `N = rooms.length`.  A key `rooms[i][j] = v` opens the room with number `v`.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room `0`). 
You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return `true` if and only if you can enter every room.


Example 1:
Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:  
We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.

We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.

We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.

We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.


Example 2:
Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.

Note:
`1 <= rooms.length <= 1000`
`0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
The number of keys in all rooms combined is at most `3000`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of accessing all rooms using the keys found in each room, we can model this scenario as a graph traversal problem. Each room represents a node, and each key found in a room represents an edge to another node (or room). Our goal is to determine whether we can visit every room starting from room 0, using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach the problem:

1. **Initialization**: We need a visited list to keep track of which rooms we have entered. We start by marking room 0 as visited since that's where we start.

2. **Graph Traversal**: We can use either DFS or BFS to explore the rooms. For simplicity, we'll use DFS in this implementation. We will maintain a stack of rooms to explore. For each room we visit, we will collect all keys available in that room and attempt to enter the corresponding rooms.

3. **Key Collection**: As we traverse the rooms, we will "collect" keys found in each room. If we find a key to a room that hasn't been visited yet, we'll add that room to our stack for further exploration.

4. **Completion Check**: Finally, after we finish our traversal, we simply check if all rooms have been visited.

5. **Return Result**: If all rooms have been visited, we return `true`. If any room remains unvisited by the end, we return `false`.

Here's the complete code that implements the above logic:



```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        # Initialize the set of visited rooms and stack for DFS
        visited = set()
        stack = [0]  # Start from room 0
        
        # While there are rooms to explore
        while stack:
            # Explore the next room in the stack
            room = stack.pop() 
            # If the room is not visited, mark it as visited
            if room not in visited:
                visited.add(room)
                # Collect keys from the current room
                for key in rooms[room]:
                    # If the key opens a room we haven't visited, add it to the stack
                    if key not in visited:
                        stack.append(key)

        # Check if we have visited all rooms
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.canVisitAllRooms([[1],[2],[3],[]]))  # Output: True
# print(sol.canVisitAllRooms([[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]))  # Output: False

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Class and Function Definition**: We define a class `Solution` with a method `canVisitAllRooms` that takes a list of rooms as an argument.
  
- **Visited Set**: The `visited` set keeps track of the rooms that we have already entered. It prevents us from re-entering rooms unnecessarily.

- **Stack Initialization**: The stack starts with room `0`. We will use it to facilitate our DFS.

- **While Loop**: The loop continues until there are no more rooms to explore in the stack. We pop the top room from the stack and check if we have visited it before.

- **Room Exploration**: If the room hasn't been visited, we mark it as visited, and we look for keys in that room. Each key allows us to access a new room, which we add to the stack if it hasn't been visited already.

- **Final Check**: By comparing the size of the `visited` set with the total number of rooms, we determine if we can access all rooms.

This approach runs efficiently and comfortably within the problem constraints, making it suitable for LeetCode submissions. The solution has a time complexity of O(N + K), where N is the number of rooms and K is the total number of keys in all rooms combined.

# 851. Loud and Rich

### Problem Description 
In a group of N people (labelled `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

For convenience, we'll call the person with label `x`, simply "person `x`".

We'll say that `richer[i] = [x, y]` if person `x` definitely has more money than person `y`.  Note that `richer` may only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say `quiet[x] = q` if person x has quietness `q`.

Now, return `answer`, where `answer[x] = y` if `y` is the least quiet person (that is, the person `y` with the smallest value of `quiet[y]`), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person `x`.


Example 1:
Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.

Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.

The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

answer[7] = 7.

Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
(which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
is person 7.

The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.

Note:
`1 <= quiet.length = N <= 500`
`0 <= quiet[i] < N`, all `quiet[i]` are different.

`0 <= richer.length <= N * (N-1) / 2`
`0 <= richer[i][j] < N`
`richer[i][0] != richer[i][1]`
`richer[i]`'s are all different.

The observations in `richer` are all logically consistent.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the quietest person who has equal or more wealth for each person in the group, we can utilize a graph-based approach where we treat each person as a node and the `richer` relationships as directed edges.

### Overview of the Approach:
1. **Graph Representation**: We represent the richer relationships using an adjacency list. If person `x` is richer than person `y`, we will represent this as an edge from `y` to `x` in our graph.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: For each person, we will use DFS to explore all people who are definitely richer than them, keeping track of the quietest person encountered during exploration.
3. **Cache Results**: To optimize performance, we can store the results of already computed people so that we do not repeat work.

### Steps to implement:
- Initialize a list `answer` to store the result for each person.
- Create an adjacency list to represent the `richer` relationships.
- Define a recursive function using DFS to determine the quietest person who is richer than the given person.
- Iterate through each person and populate the answers using the DFS function.

### Python Code Implementation:
Here's the complete implementation of the solution in Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def loudAndRich(self, richer, quiet):
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Number of people
        N = len(quiet)
        
        # Adjacency list to represent the richer relationships
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in richer:
            graph[y].append(x)
        
        # Answer array where answer[i] will store the quietest person richer than or equal to person i
        answer = [-1] * N
        
        def dfs(person):
            # If we already computed the answer for this person, return it
            if answer[person] != -1:
                return answer[person]
            
            # Initially, the person themselves is the quietest
            quietest_person = person
            
            # Explore all people who are richer than the current person
            for richer_person in graph[person]:
                potential_quietest = dfs(richer_person)
                # If the found person is quieter, update the quietest person
                if quiet[potential_quietest] < quiet[quietest_person]:
                    quietest_person = potential_quietest
            
            # Store the result in the answer array
            answer[person] = quietest_person
            return quietest_person
        
        # Run DFS for each person
        for i in range(N):
            if answer[i] == -1:  # If this person has not been computed yet
                dfs(i)
        
        return answer

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Graph Construction**: We use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to store which people are richer than others.
2. **DFS Implementation**: The `dfs` function starts from a given person and checks all richer individuals recursively. It updates the `quietest_person` when a quieter individual is found during the search.
3. **Answer Computation**: We loop through each person. If their answer hasn't been calculated, we call `dfs` to compute it.
4. **Result Return**: Finally, the `answer` list, which contains the quietest person for each individual, is returned.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of richer relationships.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + E) for the adjacency list and O(N) for the answer list and recursion call stack.

This implementation is efficient and complies with the constraints given in the problem, making it suitable for the LeetCode platform.

# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
We are given a binary tree (with root node `root`), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node.  The answer can be returned in any order.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
Output: [7,4,1]
Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.

Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.

The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.

Note:
The given tree is non-empty.

Each node in the tree has unique values `0 <= node.val <= 500`.

The `target` node is a node in the tree.

`0 <= K <= 1000`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding all nodes at a distance `K` from a given `target` node in a binary tree, we can break the solution down into several steps. Our approach will involve traversing the binary tree to form a mapping of parent nodes, then executing a breadth-first search (BFS) to find all nodes that are at the required distance from the `target` node.

### Plan

1. **Create a Parent Mapping**: We will traverse the tree to create a mapping of each node to its parent. This allows us to easily traverse "upwards" from the node.

2. **Locate the Target Node**: During our traversal, we will also locate the `target` node.

3. **BFS to Find Nodes at Distance K**: Starting from the `target` node, we will perform a BFS to explore all nodes that are at a distance `K`, considering nodes downward and upward using our parent mapping.

### Implementation

Here is the code that implements this approach:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def distanceK(self, root: TreeNode, target: TreeNode, K: int) -> List[int]:
        from collections import defaultdict, deque
        
        # Step 1: Create a parent mapping
        parent = {}
        
        def build_parent_mapping(node, par=None):
            if node:
                parent[node] = par  # Set the parent for the current node
                build_parent_mapping(node.left, node)  # Visit left child
                build_parent_mapping(node.right, node)  # Visit right child
        
        build_parent_mapping(root)
        
        # Step 2: Perform BFS starting from the target node
        visited = set()  # To keep track of visited nodes
        queue = deque([(target, 0)])  # (node, current distance from target)
        visited.add(target)  # Mark the target node as visited
        result = []
        
        while queue:
            if queue[0][1] == K:  # If we have reached the distance K
                result.extend(node.val for node, _ in queue)  # Add all nodes in queue to result
                break  # No need to search further
            
            node, distance = queue.popleft()  # Get the current node and its distance
            
            # Check the left child
            if node.left and node.left not in visited:
                visited.add(node.left)
                queue.append((node.left, distance + 1))
                
            # Check the right child
            if node.right and node.right not in visited:
                visited.add(node.right)
                queue.append((node.right, distance + 1))
                
            # Check the parent
            if parent[node] and parent[node] not in visited:
                visited.add(parent[node])
                queue.append((parent[node], distance + 1))
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TreeNode Class**: This is a standard definition for a binary tree node.

2. **Solution Class**: The main class that contains the `distanceK` method.
   - `build_parent_mapping(node, par)` function recursively traverses the tree to create a mapping of each node to its parent.

3. **BFS Implementation**: We use a deque to implement our BFS:
   - We start from the `target` node and initialize a queue with `(target, 0)` indicating that we are at distance 0 from the target.
   - As we explore nodes, we check the left and right children and also the parent. If a child or parent hasn't been visited, we add them to the queue with an incremented distance.
   - Once we reach nodes at distance `K`, we collect their values and stop the search.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the traversal for creating the parent mapping and the subsequent BFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case for storing the parent mapping and the visited nodes.

This implementation is efficient and effectively solves the problem as per the stated constraints.

# 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Note: This question is the same as 1123: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.

The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.

Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree.


Example 3:
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 500]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 500`
The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the smallest subtree that contains all the deepest nodes in a binary tree, we can return the node that serves as the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all the deepest leaves.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Deepest Nodes**: We need to find which nodes are the deepest in the tree (the ones with the highest depth).
2. **LCA of Deepest Nodes**: Once we have the deepest nodes, we need to identify the smallest subtree that contains all of them, which can be achieved by finding the LCA of these nodes.

### Approach
1. **Depth Calculation**: We can perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the depth of each node while simultaneously tracking the deepest nodes.
2. **Finding LCA**: As we traverse the tree again, we can ascertain the LCA of the deepest nodes.

### Code
Here's how this can be implemented in Python, following the LeetCode format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # Helper function to find the depth and return the deepest node
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            left_depth = dfs(node.left)
            right_depth = dfs(node.right)
            
            # Return the maximum depth from this node
            return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

        # The main function to find LCA of deepest leaves
        def find_lca(node, depth):
            if not node:
                return (None, 0)

            left_lca, left_depth = find_lca(node.left, depth)
            right_lca, right_depth = find_lca(node.right, depth)

            current_depth = left_depth + right_depth + 1
            
            if left_depth == right_depth and left_depth == (depth - 1):
                # We found the deepest LCA
                return (node, current_depth)
            
            # Return the LCA from the child nodes and the current depth
            if left_depth > right_depth:
                return (left_lca, left_depth + 1)
            else:
                return (right_lca, right_depth + 1)
        
        # First, we find the maximum depth
        max_depth = dfs(root)

        # Then, we find the LCA of deepest leaves
        lca_node, _ = find_lca(root, max_depth)
        return lca_node

```

### Explanation
1. **TreeNode Class**: This is the definition of a binary tree node. Each node has a value, a left child, and a right child.
  
2. **lcaDeepestLeaves Method**: This method will be called with the root of the tree.
  
3. **dfs Function**: This is a helper function that calculates the depth of the tree recursively:
   - If the node is null, it returns 0 (base case).
   - It computes the depth of left and right children and returns the maximum of the two depths + 1.

4. **find_lca Function**: Another recursive function to find the LCA of the deepest leaves:
   - It returns a tuple containing the LCA node and the depth at which this LCA occurs.
   - It checks if both children have the same depth; if so, the current node is the LCA.
   - Otherwise, it checks which child has the greater depth and continues the search.

5. **Calling find_lca**: Pass the calculated maximum depth to `find_lca` to ensure we are looking for the LCA of all deepest nodes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree (as both functions traverse all nodes).
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

This solution efficiently finds the smallest subtree containing all the deepest nodes in a binary tree.

# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

### Problem Description 
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.


Example 1:
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1]
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [2]
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: root1 = [1,2], root2 = [2,2]
Output: true

Example 5:
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range `[1, 200]`.

Both of the given trees will have values in the range `[0, 200]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining if two binary trees are leaf-similar, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define a Function to Collect Leaf Values**: We need a helper function that will traverse the binary tree and collect the values of all leaves in a list. A leaf node is defined as a node that has no left or right children.

2. **Compare the Two Lists of Leaf Values**: Once we have collected the leaf values from both trees, we can simply compare the two lists to see if they are identical.

3. **Return True or False**: Based on the comparison, we'll return `True` if the lists match, and `False` otherwise.

The following Python code implements these steps in a format compatible with LeetCode.



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> bool:
        
        def collectLeaves(node: TreeNode, leaves: list):
            if node is None:
                return
            # If the node is a leaf, add its value to the leaves list
            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                leaves.append(node.val)
            else:
                # Otherwise, continue traversing the tree
                collectLeaves(node.left, leaves)
                collectLeaves(node.right, leaves)
        
        leaves1 = []
        leaves2 = []
        
        # Collect leaves from both trees
        collectLeaves(root1, leaves1)
        collectLeaves(root2, leaves2)
        
        # Compare the two leaf value sequences
        return leaves1 == leaves2

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This class defines the structure of our tree nodes, which includes the value of the node and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **Solution Class**: We create a `Solution` class where we will define our main function `leafSimilar`.

3. **collectLeaves Function**: This is a nested helper function that takes a node and a list as parameters:
   - If the node is `None`, it simply returns.
   - If the node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), it appends the value of the node to the `leaves` list.
   - If the node is not a leaf, it recursively calls itself on the left and right children.

4. **Leaf Value Collection**: We call `collectLeaves` on both `root1` and `root2`, passing in two separate lists (`leaves1` and `leaves2`) to store the leaf values.

5. **Comparison**: Finally, we compare `leaves1` and `leaves2`. If they are identical, we return `True`, otherwise, we return `False`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the total number of nodes in both trees (we traverse each tree once).
- **Space Complexity**: O(H) where H is the height of the trees due to the recursion stack, and O(L) for the leaves list, where L is the number of leaf nodes.

This solution efficiently checks for leaf-similarity between two binary trees while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

# 886. Possible Bipartition

### Problem Description 
Given a set of `N` people (numbered `1, 2, ..., N`), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size.

Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. 
Formally, if `dislikes[i] = [a, b]`, it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered `a` and `b` into the same group.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.


Example 1:
Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= N <= 2000`
`0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000`
`dislikes[i].length == 2`
`1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N`
`dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]`
There does not exist `i != j` for which `dislikes[i] == dislikes[j]`.

### Solution 
 To determine if we can divide a set of `N` people into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group, we can model this problem as a graph bipartition problem. 

### Explanation:

1. **Model the Problem**: 
   - Represent each person as a vertex in a graph.
   - Each dislike relationship between two people can be represented as an undirected edge connecting two vertices.
   - The task is to check if this graph can be colored using 2 colors (which represent the two groups).

2. **Graph Coloring**:
   - We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to attempt to color the graph.
   - We will use a list to store the color for each vertex. Initially, all vertices are uncolored (represented by -1).
   - Starting from any uncolored vertex, we assign it a color (say 0) and then attempt to color all adjacent vertices with the opposite color (1). 

3. **Check for Conflicts**:
   - If during coloring we find that an adjacent vertex has already been colored with the same color, it means that it’s not possible to partition the graph into two groups, hence return `false`.

4. **Multiple Components**:
   - Since the graph can be disconnected, we need to ensure we start the coloring process for each unvisited vertex.

### Python Code:

Here is how you can implement the above plan in Python, formatted to run directly on LeetCode:



```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def possibleBipartition(self, N: int, dislikes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Create the adjacency list for the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for a, b in dislikes:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        # This will hold the color assigned to each person : -1 means uncolored
        color = [-1] * (N + 1)
        
        # Function to perform BFS and color the graph
        def bfs(start):
            queue = deque([start])
            color[start] = 0  # Assign the first color
            
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if color[neighbor] == -1:  # If neighbor is uncolored
                        # Assign the opposite color to neighbor
                        color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]
                        queue.append(neighbor)
                    elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:  # Conflict
                        return False
            return True
        
        # Check for each person if they have been colored
        for person in range(1, N + 1):
            if color[person] == -1:  # Not colored yet
                if not bfs(person):  # Perform BFS from this person
                    return False
        
        return True

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first set up a default dictionary to create an adjacency list from the dislikes list.
- We then initialize a color list to keep track of the colors of each person.
- The `bfs` function colors the graph starting from a given node, checking for conflicts as it goes along.
- Finally, we loop through each person to ensure that all components of the graph are handled, initiating a BFS where needed.

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(N + E), where E is the number of edges (dislikes).
- Space Complexity: O(N + E), for the adjacency list and color tracking. 

This solution efficiently verifies if a bipartitioning is possible and should work effectively under the problem's constraints.

# 897. Increasing Order Search Tree

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only one right child.


Example 1:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,1,7]
Output: [1,null,5,null,7]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 100]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to transform the input binary search tree (BST) into a right-skewed tree (where every node has no left child and only one right child). The key to achieving this is to perform an in-order traversal of the BST to retrieve the nodes in sorted order and then construct the resulting skewed tree from these nodes.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **In-Order Traversal**: In a BST, the in-order traversal visits nodes in non-decreasing order. We'll use this property to gather the values of the nodes.

2. **Building the New Tree**: After getting the sorted list of node values from the in-order traversal, we will create a new tree where each node's right pointer points to the next value in the sorted list.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - We will define a function to perform in-order traversal and return a sorted list of node values.
   - We will define another function to construct the skewed tree from the sorted list of values.

### Python Code

Here is the Python code to implement the solution according to the LeetCode format:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def increasingBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # Step 1: In-order traversal to collect the values
        values = []
        
        def inOrder(node):
            if node:
                inOrder(node.left)  # Visit left subtree
                values.append(node.val)  # Visit node
                inOrder(node.right)  # Visit right subtree
        
        inOrder(root)

        # Step 2: Build a new tree from the sorted values
        newRoot = TreeNode(0)  # Create a dummy node
        current = newRoot
        
        for val in values:
            current.right = TreeNode(val)  # Create new node
            current = current.right  # Move to the right
        
        return newRoot.right  # Return the right child of the dummy node


```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **TreeNode Class**: We define a `TreeNode` class to represent the nodes of our binary tree. It has a value (`val`) and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **Solution Class**: The `Solution` class contains the method `increasingBST` which will rearrange the BST as required.
   - We first declare an empty list `values` to store the values of nodes during in-order traversal.

3. **In-Order Function**: The `inOrder` function is a recursive helper function that populates the `values` list by traversing the tree in in-order.

4. **Building the New Tree**:
   - We create a dummy node `newRoot` to facilitate the tree construction.
   - We iterate over the sorted `values` list and create a new node for each value, linking them via their right pointers.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the `right` child of the `newRoot` (which is the new tree's root) that we constructed.

### Example Traversal
For the input `[5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]`, the in-order traversal yields `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, and the resulting tree will be structured as a right-skewed tree.

This code can be directly run in LeetCode's environment under the specified problem.

# 924. Minimize Malware Spread

### Problem Description 
You are given a network of `n` nodes represented as an `n x n` adjacency matrix `graph`, where the `ith` node is directly connected to the `jth` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`.

Some nodes `initial` are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected, and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose `M(initial)` is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops. We will remove exactly one node from `initial`.

Return the node that, if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`. If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.

Note that if a node was removed from the `initial` list of infected nodes, it might still be infected later due to the malware spread.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`n == graph.length`
`n == graph[i].length`
`2 <= n <= 300`
`graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

`graph[i][j] == graph[j][i]`
`graph[i][i] == 1`
`1 <= initial.length <= n`
`0 <= initial[i] <= n - 1`
All the integers in `initial` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of identifying which node, when removed from the initially infected set of nodes, minimizes the total spread of malware in the network, we can take the following steps:

1. **Modeling the Malware Spread:** The network can be thought of as a graph where nodes represent computers and edges represent direct connections. We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the graph and determine how malware spreads from initially infected nodes.

2. **Simulating the Infection:** For each node in the initial set of infected nodes, we'll simulate removing that node and calculate how many nodes eventually get infected. 

3. **Keeping Track of Infected Components:** We can use a visited list to keep track of which nodes have been infected during our simulations. An additional dictionary or list can be used to store the count of infections caused by each initially infected node.

4. **Choosing the Optimal Node to Remove:** After simulating the removal of each initially infected node, we can compare the sizes of the total infected nodes for all simulations to determine which removal minimizes the infection spread. If multiple removals yield the same minimal infection count, we choose the one with the smallest index.

Here is the complete Python code that adheres to the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def minMalwareSpread(self, graph: List[List[int]], initial: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict, deque
        
        n = len(graph)
        initial_set = set(initial)
        
        def bfs(start, visited):
            queue = deque([start])
            visited.add(start)
            count = 0
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                count += 1
                for neighbor, connected in enumerate(graph[node]):
                    if connected == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            return count
        
        # Count the infected nodes contributed by each initial node
        contribution = defaultdict(int)
        
        for node in initial:
            visited = set()
            infected_count = bfs(node, visited)
            for v in visited:
                if v not in initial_set:
                    contribution[v] += infected_count
        
        min_infected = float('inf')
        result_node = min(initial)  # To ensure the smallest index in case of ties
        
        for node in initial:
            # Simulate the removal of this node
            visited = set()
            total_infected = 0
            for n in initial:
                if n != node:
                    infected_count = bfs(n, visited)
                    total_infected += infected_count
            
            # Check if this results in the minimum infected nodes
            if total_infected < min_infected:
                min_infected = total_infected
                result_node = node
            elif total_infected == min_infected:
                result_node = min(result_node, node)
        
        return result_node

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Imports and Initialization:** We import the necessary modules and initialize variables. The `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency matrix, and `initial` represents the initially infected nodes.

2. **BFS Function:** The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search starting from a given node. It marks nodes as visited and counts the number of nodes that get infected.

3. **Infected Contribution:** We calculate how many nodes each node in the `initial` list contributes to the overall infection when left in the initial set.

4. **Calculation of Infected Nodes After Removal:** For each node in the `initial` list, we simulate removing it and calculate the total number of infections that would result.

5. **Selecting the Result:** We track the node removal that minimizes the number of infections and also handle ties by selecting the node with the smallest index.

6. **Return the Result:** Finally, we return the node that should be removed for a minimized infection spread.

This solution effectively utilizes graph traversal techniques to simulate and analyze the spread of malware while ensuring that it operates within the constraints of the problem.

# 928. Minimize Malware Spread II

### Problem Description 
You are given a network of `n` nodes represented as an `n x n` adjacency matrix `graph`, where the `ith` node is directly connected to the `jth` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`.

Some nodes `initial` are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected, and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose `M(initial)` is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove exactly one node from `initial`, completely removing it and any connections from this node to any other node.

Return the node that, if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`. If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: graph = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[0,0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`n == graph.length`
`n == graph[i].length`
`2 <= n <= 300`
`graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

`graph[i][j] == graph[j][i]`
`graph[i][i] == 1`
`1 <= initial.length < n`
`0 <= initial[i] <= n - 1`
All the integers in `initial` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of minimizing the spread of malware in a network represented by an adjacency matrix, we'll take the following steps:

1. **Model the Problem**: We treat the network as a graph where nodes represent computers and the edges (represented by 1's in the adjacency matrix) denote direct connections between them. The goal is to determine which single infected node to remove so that the total number of infected nodes after the malware spreads is minimized.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will perform DFS to simulate the malware spread. For each node in the `initial` list, we will temporarily remove that node and measure the total infected nodes after the spread. We'll keep track of the minimum affected count and the corresponding node to be removed.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - We will create a function `dfs` that checks how many nodes get infected starting from given infected nodes considering the current state of the graph.
   - We will iterate through each node in `initial`, perform the DFS while excluding that node, and calculate the spread.
   - We'll keep track of the minimum size of the infected nodes set after attempting to remove each node.

Here's the implementation in Python following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def minMalwareSpread(self, graph: List[List[int]], initial: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict

        n = len(graph)
        
        # Convert the initial list into a set for easier checks
        initial_set = set(initial)
        
        def dfs(node, visited):
            for neighbor in range(n):
                if graph[node][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor, visited)

        # Dictionary to keep track of how many unique infections each node can affect
        affected_count = defaultdict(int)

        # Perform a DFS call for each infected node
        for node in initial:
            visited = set()
            dfs(node, visited)
            # Count how many of the visited nodes are in the initial set
            # Only count those that do not include the current node being removed
            for v in visited:
                if v in initial_set:
                    affected_count[v] += 1

        min_infected = float('inf')
        best_node = float('inf')

        # Evaluate each node in initial to determine which one to remove
        for node in sorted(initial):
            # If we remove this node, calculate the total infected nodes
            total_infected = 0
            for v in initial:
                if v != node:
                    total_infected += 1
                    # If the affected_count has more than one infected node that can spread,  
                    # then the total infected includes the ones we can spread with.
                    if affected_count[v] == 1:
                        total_infected += affected_count[v] - 1
            # Check if we found a new minimum
            if total_infected < min_infected:
                min_infected = total_infected
                best_node = node
            
        return best_node

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We create a set from the `initial` list for quick membership checks and define our `dfs` function to track the spread of malware.

2. **DFS Implementation**: The `dfs` function recursively marks all connected nodes (infected by malware) starting from the given node. The nodes that get infected are stored in a `visited` set.

3. **Counting Affected Nodes**: After performing DFS for each node in `initial`, we check how many other infected nodes would be affected if we were to remove the current node. We store this information in `affected_count`.

4. **Determine Best Node**: Finally, we iterate over each node in `initial`, simulating their removal and calculating the total number of infected nodes left. We track the minimum possible number of infections and record the best node to remove.

5. **Return Value**: The function ultimately returns the index of the node that can be removed to achieve the minimum spread of malware.

This solution efficiently calculates the required output while conforming to the constraints provided in the problem.

# 934. Shortest Bridge

### Problem Description 
In a given 2D binary array `A`, there are two islands.  (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s not connected to any other 1s.)
Now, we may change `0`s to `1`s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.

Return the smallest number of `0`s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

Example 1:
Input: A = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: A = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: A = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`2 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100`
`A[i][j] == 0` or `A[i][j] == 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of connecting two islands in a 2D binary array with the minimum number of `0`s flipped to `1`s, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here’s a step-by-step explanation followed by the code in LeetCode format.

### Explanation:

1. **Identify the Islands**: We first need to locate the positions of the two islands in the binary matrix. We can do this using a flood-fill technique (DFS or BFS) to find all the `1`s and mark them as part of the first island, leaving the second island unvisited.

2. **Perform BFS from the First Island**: Once the first island has been identified, we will initiate a BFS from every `1` in the first island. We will explore the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).

3. **Track the Distance**: During BFS, we will keep track of how many `0`s we need to flip to reach the second island. This can be done by incrementing a distance counter whenever we encounter a `0`. The BFS continues until we encounter a cell that's part of the second island, at which point we record the distance.

4. **Return the Result**: The minimum distance found during the BFS from any of the `1`s in the first island to a `1` in the second island will be our result.

Here's the code to implement the above logic:



```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestBridge(self, A):
        # Directions for moving up, down, left, right
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        n, m = len(A), len(A[0])
        
        # Function to perform a DFS and mark the first island
        def dfs(x, y):
            # Stack for DFS
            stack = [(x, y)]
            while stack:
                cx, cy = stack.pop()
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and A[nx][ny] == 1:
                        A[nx][ny] = -1  # Mark as visited
                        stack.append((nx, ny))
                        island1.append((nx, ny))

        # Step 1: Find the first island and mark it
        island1 = []
        
        found = False
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if A[i][j] == 1:
                    dfs(i, j)
                    found = True
                    break
                if found:
                    break

        # Step 2: BFS to find the shortest path to the second island
        queue = deque(island1)
        distance = 0
        
        while queue:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:
                        if A[nx][ny] == 1:  # We found the second island
                            return distance
                        if A[nx][ny] == 0:  # It's a water cell, flip it
                            A[nx][ny] = -1  # Mark as visited
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
            distance += 1
        
        return distance  # This return should never hit based on the problem statement

```

### Breakdown of Code:
- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function marks the first island and collects its points in `island1`.
- **BFS Implementation**: BFS starts from all points of the first island in `island1`. For each water cell `0` encountered, we continue searching until we find a `1` from the second island.
- **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` variable counts how many `0`s are flipped when reaching from the first island to the second island.

This solution efficiently identifies the connection between two islands with minimal flips, fitting within the problem constraints.

# 938. Range Sum of BST

### Problem Description 
Given the `root` node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the range `[low, high]`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32

Example 2:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2 * 104]`.

`1 <= Node.val <= 105`
`1 <= low <= high <= 105`
All `Node.val` are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of summing the values of all nodes within a specified range in a binary search tree (BST), we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The properties of a BST allow us to navigate through the tree efficiently by deciding whether to explore left or right branches based on the current node's value relative to the defined range.

Here’s how we can approach the problem:

1. **Node Traversal**: Start traversing from the root of the BST. Check each node's value:
   - If the value is between `low` and `high`, add it to the running total.
   - If the value exceeds `high`, there is no need to explore the right subtree (since all values there will also be greater).
   - If the value is less than `low`, there is no need to explore the left subtree (since all values there will also be less).

2. **Recursive Function**: We'll define a recursive helper function that will perform the DFS. It will take the current node and the current range as arguments.

3. **Base Case**: The function should return when it encounters a null node.

Let's look at the implementation:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def rangeSumBST(self, root: TreeNode, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum
        self.total_sum = 0
        
        # Helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(node: TreeNode):
            # Base case: If the node is None, return
            if not node:
                return
            
            # If the node's value is within range, add to the total sum
            if low <= node.val <= high:
                self.total_sum += node.val
            
            # If the node's value is greater than low, explore the left subtree
            if node.val > low:
                dfs(node.left)
            
            # If the node's value is less than high, explore the right subtree
            if node.val < high:
                dfs(node.right)
        
        # Start DFS from the root
        dfs(root)
        
        # Return the total sum of values in the specified range
        return self.total_sum

```

### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **TreeNode Class**: This class represents each node in the binary search tree and has attributes for its value and its left and right children.

2. **Solution Class**: Contains the method `rangeSumBST` which initializes `total_sum` to zero and defines an inner `dfs` function for the depth-first search.

3. **DFS Logic**:
   - If the current `node` is `None`, it simply returns.
   - We check if the current node's value lies between `low` and `high`. If it does, we add its value to `total_sum`.
   - We then decide whether to traverse left or right based on the current node’s value:
     - If `node.val > low`, we traverse the left subtree since there may be values in that range.
     - If `node.val < high`, we traverse the right subtree for the same reason.
   
4. **Return Value**: Finally, after traversing the tree, we return the accumulated `total_sum`.

This solution efficiently computes the sum of node values that lie within the specified range while adhering to the properties of binary search trees, resulting in a time complexity of O(N) in the worst-case scenario (where N is the number of nodes in the BST) and an average case of O(log N) for balanced trees. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

# 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

### Problem Description 
On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the `ith` stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].

2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].

3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].

4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].

5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].

Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.


Example 2:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].

2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].

3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].

Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.


Example 3:
Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: [0,0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.


Constraints:
`1 <= stones.length <= 1000`
`0 <= xi, yi <= 104`
No two stones are at the same coordinate point.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the number of stones we can remove from a 2D plane while ensuring that remaining stones share either the same row or the same column with others, we can utilize the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) also known as Union-Find. This approach efficiently manages and tracks components within the grid to determine which stones can be considered "connected".

Here’s a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **Understanding Connections**:
   - Stones in the same row or column can be thought of as being connected. For example, if stone A is in row 0 and stone B is also in row 0 or in the same column as A, they are in the same component.

2. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - We'll use a union-find (or disjoint set) structure to efficiently group the rows and columns of stones. Each stone can be treated as a representative of its row and column.

3. **Union Operations**:
   - For each stone's position \( (x_i, y_i) \):
     - We create a union between its row \( (x_i) \) and its column \( (y_i + 10000) \). The addition of \( 10000 \) to the column index ensures there is no overlap with row indices since the constraints guarantee coordinates between \( 0 \) and \( 10^4 \).

4. **Count Unique Components**:
   - After processing all stones, the number of unique components gives us how many connected groups of stones exist. If there are \( c \) connected components, we can remove \( n - c \) stones (where \( n \) is the total number of stones).

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a union-find structure.
   - Union the row and column indices of each stone.
   - Count the number of unique sets to determine how many stones can remain.

### Python Code:

Here is the Python implementation following the described approach, which can be directly run on LeetCode:



```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            # Union by rank
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1
                
class Solution:
    def removeStones(self, stones: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(stones)
        uf = UnionFind(20000)  # Create a disjoint set for rows and columns

        for x, y in stones:
            uf.union(x, y + 10000)  # Union row x with column y + 10000
        
        # Count how many unique root parents there are
        roots = set()
        for x, y in stones:
            roots.add(uf.find(x))  # Use the row index for the root

        return n - len(roots)  # Max removable stones


```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **UnionFind Class**: Handles the union-find logic with path compression and union by rank for efficiency.
- **removeStones function**: Main function to perform the union operations on the stones and count the unique components.
- **Return Statement**: The result is derived from subtracting the number of unique root components from the total number of stones to get the maximum stones that can be removed. 

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of approximately \( O(n \alpha(n)) \) where \( \alpha \) is the inverse Ackermann function, making it nearly constant time for practical sizes.

# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

### Problem Description 
In a N x N `grid` composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a `/`, `\`, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `\` is represented as `"\\"`.)
Return the number of regions.


Example 1:
Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 2:
Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 3:
Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 4:
Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 5:
Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:
Note:
`1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30`
`grid[i][j]` is either `'/'`, `'\'`, or `' '`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting contiguous regions within a grid composed of `/`, `\`, and blank spaces, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The main idea is to traverse the grid, and whenever we find an unvisited cell that belongs to a region, we conduct a search to mark all parts of that region as visited. 

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Understanding the Grid:**
   - Each `1 x 1` square can be visualized as having a specific internal structure depending on whether it contains `/`, `\`, or is blank.
   - The slashes divide the grid into regions. A `/` creates two triangles whereas a `\` also creates two triangles, but they connect differently.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Use a helper structure to represent how each cell contributes to regions. 
   - Each cell can connect to its neighboring cells based on the characters it contains.

3. **DFS Algorithm:**
   - Create a visited matrix to keep track of which cells have been checked.
   - Loop through each cell in the grid. If a cell has not been visited, perform a DFS to mark all connected cells of that region as visited.
   - Count each new unvisited cell as the start of a new region.

4. **Cell Navigation:**
   - Manage movement within the grid such that moving from one cell to its neighbor respects the division of the regions caused by `/` and `\`.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid: List[str]) -> int:
        N = len(grid)
        visited = [[False] * (N * 3) for _ in range(N * 3)]

            visited[r][c] = True

                    dfs(r, c + 1)  # Move right

        regions = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if not visited[i * 3 + 1][j * 3 + 1]:  # If center of cell not visited
                    dfs(i * 3 + 1, j * 3 + 1)
                    regions += 1
        
        return regions

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The solution creates a `3N x 3N` visited grid to track visits at a more granular level since each cell influences multiple sub-regions.
 
2. **DFS Function:**
   - The DFS function navigates through the grid based on the conditions defined above, ensuring that all reachable parts of the current region are marked as visited.

3. **Counting Regions:**
   - For each unvisited center of a `1 x 1` cell (i.e., positions `1, 1`, `1, 4`, etc.), we initiate a DFS and increment our region count.

4. **Return Results:**
   - Finally, we return the number of contiguous regions that have been found. 

### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(N^2) since we go through every cell and perform DFS potentially covering it fully.
- Space Complexity: O(N^2) for the visited matrix.

This solution can easily be tested on the LeetCode platform, and it meets the given constraints effectively.

# 967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences

### Problem Description 
Return all non-negative integers of length `n` such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`.

Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros. For example, `01` has one leading zero and is invalid.

You may return the answer in any order.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 7
Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, k = 0
Output: [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99]

Example 4:
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: [13,20,24,31,35,42,46,53,57,64,68,75,79,86,97]

Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 9`
`0 <= k <= 9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding all non-negative integers of length `n` where the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will build numbers digit by digit, ensuring each constructed number adheres to the conditions set by the problem.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Constraints**: 
   - The first digit cannot be zero since we want non-negative integers without leading zeros.
   - For each digit, we can choose the next digit such that the absolute difference between the current digit and the next digit is `k`.

2. **Recursive Backtracking**: 
   - We can use a recursive function to build numbers from the highest place value to the lowest.
   - At each step, we check possible next digits that can follow the current digit. This will be the current digit plus `k` and the current digit minus `k`.
   - If the next digit is valid (i.e. in the range 0-9), we can continue building the number.

3. **Base Case**: 
   - When the length of the current number reaches `n`, we add it to our results.

4. **Initialization**: 
   - We start building numbers from each digit from 1 to 9 (the first digit), as leading zeros are not allowed.

5. **Result Collection**: 
   - We will store valid numbers in a list and return this list at the end.

### Implementation in Python:

Here’s how the implementation looks:



```python
class Solution:
    def numsSameConsecDiff(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        def backtrack(current_number: int, length: int):
            # Base case: If we've reached the desired length
            if length == n:
                result.append(current_number)
                return
            
            # Get the last digit of the current number
            last_digit = current_number % 10
            
            # Calculate next possible digits
            next_digits = set()  # Using a set to avoid duplicates
            if last_digit + k <= 9:
                next_digits.add(last_digit + k)
            if last_digit - k >= 0 and k != 0:  # k=0 means same digit can be used
                next_digits.add(last_digit - k)
            
            # Recur for all next possible digits
            for next_digit in next_digits:
                new_number = current_number * 10 + next_digit
                backtrack(new_number, length + 1)
        
        # Result list to hold all valid numbers of length n
        result = []
        
        # Start building numbers with first digit from 1 to 9
        for i in range(1, 10):
            backtrack(i, 1)
        
        return result

# Example of usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.numsSameConsecDiff(3, 7))  # Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
# print(sol.numsSameConsecDiff(2, 1))  # Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We define a class `Solution` with a method `numsSameConsecDiff`.
- The `backtrack` function constructs the numbers recursively:
  - It checks if the current length matches the required length `n`, if so, it adds the number to the results.
  - It computes the next possible digits based on the current last digit and `k`, ensuring digits stay within the valid range (0-9).
- We initiate the process by starting from each digit between 1 and 9 to avoid leading zeros.

This implementation is efficient and follows the constraints provided, ensuring we explore only valid numbers as specified in the problem.
