# 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring

### Problem Description 
Given a string `s`, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap.

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If `s` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.


Example 1:
Input: s = "banana"
Output: "ana"

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: ""

Constraints:
`2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, I'll use the Rabin-Karp Rolling Hash technique, which is well-suited for string matching, especially when looking for duplicates in strings. This technique employs a hashing function to map substrings to hash values and checks for collisions. By confirming actual substring equality only when hashes collide, it allows for efficient detection of duplicate substrings.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Hash Function**: We'll use a polynomial rolling hash function to hash the substrings.
2. **Binary Search on Length**: Determine the length of the longest duplicated substring by performing a binary search on the length, from 1 to the length of the input string. The binary search will maximize the efficiency of the solution when combined with the hashing mechanism.
3. **Checking for Duplicates**: For a given substring length, use the rolling hash to check all possible substrings. Use a set to track encountered hash values. If the same hash is encountered more than once, verify that the substrings are indeed the same to account for potential hash collisions.
4. **Updating the Result**: If a duplicate substring of a given length is found, it's a potential candidate for the result. If it's the longest such substring found, store it.
5. **Collisions**: Handle potential hash collisions by verifying the substrings are truly the same when hashes match.

### Python LeetCode Style Solution:


```python
class Solution:
    def longestDupSubstring(self, s: str) -> str:
        MOD = 2**63 - 1
        base = 26
        
        # Helper function to convert character to integer
        def char_to_int(c):
            return ord(c) - ord('a')
        
        # Binary search for finding the maximum length of duplicate substring
        left, right = 1, len(s)
        result = ""
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            found = self.findDuplicateSubstring(s, mid, base, MOD)
            if found is not None:
                left = mid + 1
                result = found
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return result
    
    def findDuplicateSubstring(self, s, length, base, MOD):
        if length == 0:
            return None
        
        # Precompute powers of base mod MOD
        power = 1
        for _ in range(length):
            power = (power * base) % MOD
        
        # Compute the hash of the first 'length' characters
        current_hash = 0
        for i in range(length):
            current_hash = (current_hash * base + char_to_int(s[i])) % MOD
        
        seen = {current_hash}
        # Rolling hash: Remove the oldest character and add the new one
        for i in range(length, len(s)):
            current_hash = (current_hash * base + char_to_int(s[i]) - char_to_int(s[i-length]) * power) % MOD
            # Check for collisions in seen hashes
            if current_hash in seen:
                # If there's a collision, check the actual substring
                start_index = i - length + 1
                candidate = s[start_index:start_index + length]
                if any(s[j:j + length] == candidate for j in range(max(0, start_index - length), min(len(s) - length + 1, start_index + 1))):
                    return candidate            
            seen.add(current_hash)
        
        return None

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.longestDupSubstring("banana"))  # Output: "ana"
print(sol.longestDupSubstring("abcd"))    # Output: ""

```

This solution will efficiently find if there exists any repeated substring and return the longest one. Adjustments for the hash modulo and base are taken considering the constraints to minimize chances of collisions.

# 1048. Longest String Chain

### Problem Description 
Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`.  For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.

A word chain is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k >= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor of `word_3`, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".


Example 2:
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5

Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 1000`
`1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
`words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 The problem of finding the longest word chain is a classic example of dynamic programming. We are given a set of words and need to identify the longest possible sequence where each word is a predecessor of the next one. A predecessor is a word that can transform into another by adding exactly one letter anywhere in the word.

Here's an outline of the approach:
1. **Sort words by length.** This is important because a shorter word can only be a predecessor of a longer word. By sorting, we ensure that we always process potential predecessors before their successors.
2. **Use dynamic programming to store the longest chain ending at each word.** We will maintain a dictionary (`dp`) where keys are words and values are the lengths of the longest chain ending with that word.
3. **Generate potential predecessors.** For each word, by inserting each letter in every possible position, check if the modified word is in the list of words (i.e., in our dp).
4. **Update the dp values.** If we find that a word `w1` can be a predecessor of `w2`, then `dp[w2] = max(dp[w2], dp[w1] + 1)`.
5. **Find the maximum length of any sequence** from the `dp` values.

This algorithm has a complexity which can approach `O(N * L^2)` where `N` is the number of words and `L` is the maximum length of a word because for every word we check every other word if it can be a predecessor.

Let's transform this explanation into an executable Python code using the standard LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Sorting words based on their length
        words.sort(key=len)
        
        # Dictionary to keep track of the longest chain ending with the word as key
        longest_chain = {}
        
        # Variable to keep the maximum length of the chain found so far
        max_length = 0
        
        # Iterate over each word in the sorted list
        for word in words:
            # Start assuming the longest chain with this word alone is 1
            longest_chain[word] = 1
            
            # Generate all possible predecessors by removing one character at a time
            for i in range(len(word)):
                predecessor = word[:i] + word[i+1:]
                if predecessor in longest_chain:
                    # If the predecessor is in the list, update the dp array
                    longest_chain[word] = max(longest_chain[word], longest_chain[predecessor] + 1)
            
            # Update the global maximum length of the chain
            max_length = max(max_length, longest_chain[word])
        
        # Return the maximum length found
        return max_length

```

This Python code can be directly copied and tested on LeetCode for the problem described. The sorting at the start ensures we process smaller words first, and the use of dictionary `longest_chain` allows for efficient look-ups and updates. Each word's potential is maximized based on its valid predecessors.

# 1078. Occurrences After Bigram

### Problem Description 
Given words `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some `text` of the form "`first second third`", where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

For each such occurrence, add "`third`" to the answer, and return the answer.


Example 1:
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]

Example 2:
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
Note:
`1 <= text.length <= 1000`
`text` consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10`
`first` and `second` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem described above, the core idea is to traverse the list of words derived from the `text` string while checking triplets of consecutive words. If the first two words in a triplet match the `first` and `second` strings respectively, add the third word to the result list.

Here is a Python function implementing this solution, which adheres to the format compatible for direct execution on the LeetCode platform:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findOcurrences(self, text: str, first: str, second: str) -> List[str]:
        words = text.split()  # Split the text into a list of words.
        n = len(words)
        result = []
        
        # Iterate through the list of words, stopping at the third last word.
        for i in range(n - 2):
            # Check if the current word and the next word match `first` and `second`.
            if words[i] == first and words[i+1] == second:
                result.append(words[i+2])  # Append the third consecutive word.
        
        return result

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findOcurrences("alice is a good girl she is a good student", "a", "good"))  # Output: ["girl", "student"]
print(sol.findOcurrences("we will we will rock you", "we", "will"))  # Output: ["we", "rock"]

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Input Parsing**: Split the `text` string into a list of words using `split()` for easier access to each word.

2. **Initialization**: Identify the number of words `n` and create an empty list `result` for storing the third words.

3. **Iteration**:
   - Loop through the words list from the start till the third last word (using `range(n - 2)`)
   - Compare each word and its immediate successor to `first` and `second`.
   - If they match, append the third word in the sequence (i.e., `words[i + 2]`) to `result`.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the list containing all the corresponding third words found in the text.

This approach runs efficiently with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of words in the text, assuming string splitting and comparisons are \(O(1)\). The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the words and the result.

# 1086. High Five

### Problem Description 
Given a list of the scores of different students, `items`, where `items[i] = [IDi, scorei]` represents one score from a student with `IDi`, calculate each student's top five average.

Return the answer as an array of pairs `result`, where `result[j] = [IDj, topFiveAveragej]` represents the student with `IDj` and their top five average. Sort `result` by `IDj` in increasing order.

A student's top five average is calculated by taking the sum of their top five scores and dividing it by `5` using integer division.


Example 1:
Input: items = [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
Explanation: 
The student with ID = 1 got scores 91, 92, 60, 65, 87, and 100. Their top five average is (100 + 92 + 91 + 87 + 65) / 5 = 87.

The student with ID = 2 got scores 93, 97, 77, 100, and 76. Their top five average is (100 + 97 + 93 + 77 + 76) / 5 = 88.6, but with integer division their average converts to 88.


Example 2:
Input: items = [[1,100],[7,100],[1,100],[7,100],[1,100],[7,100],[1,100],[7,100],[1,100],[7,100]]
Output: [[1,100],[7,100]]

Constraints:
`1 <= items.length <= 1000`
`items[i].length == 2`
`1 <= IDi <= 1000`
`0 <= scorei <= 100`
For each `IDi`, there will be at least five scores.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, follow the steps below:

1. **Use a Dictionary**: Use a dictionary to store the list of scores for each student ID as you iterate through the list of scores. The keys will be student IDs and the values will be lists of scores.

2. **Sort Scores**: For each student ID in your dictionary, sort their scores list in descending order. 

3. **Calculate Top Five Average**: For each sorted list, take the first five scores (top five), calculate their sum, and perform integer division by 5 to get the top five average.

4. **Sort and Format the Result**: After calculating the average for all students, gather each student's ID and their calculated average into a result list. Sort this list by student ID.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the result list formatted as required.

Here's how the code implementing this solution would look:



```python
from typing import List
import collections

class Solution:
    def highFive(self, items: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Dictionary to hold all scores for each student
        score_map = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        # Populate the dictionary with scores for each ID
        for id, score in items:
            score_map[id].append(score)
        
        # List to hold the results
        result = []
        
        # Process each student ID in the map
        for id, scores in score_map.items():
            # Sort the scores in descending order and take the sum of top five scores
            scores.sort(reverse=True)
            top_five_avg = sum(scores[:5]) // 5
            # Append the result for the current student ID
            result.append([id, top_five_avg])
        
        # Sort result by the ID before returning
        result.sort()
        return result

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.highFive([[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]))

```

This solution will ensure that it handles cases where there are exactly or more than five scores for each student. It assumes `items` input guarantees at least five scores per student, as mentioned in the problem constraints. The focus is on maintaining readability and efficient sorting and storage of scores.

# 1090. Largest Values From Labels

### Problem Description 
We have a set of items: the `i`-th item has value `values[i]` and label `labels[i]`.

Then, we choose a subset `S` of these items, such that:
`|S| <= num_wanted`
For every label `L`, the number of items in `S` with label `L` is `<= use_limit`.

Return the largest possible sum of the subset `S`.


Example 1:
Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], `num_wanted `= 3, use_limit = 1
Output: 9
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth item.


Example 2:
Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], `num_wanted `= 3, use_limit = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, second, and third item.


Example 3:
Input: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], `num_wanted `= 3, use_limit = 1
Output: 16
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth item.


Example 4:
Input: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], `num_wanted `= 3, use_limit = 2
Output: 24
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, second, and fourth item.

Note:
`1 <= values.length == labels.length <= 20000`
`0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 20000`
`1 <= num_wanted, use_limit <= values.length`

### Solution 
 Here is the solution in Python, and it is designed to be run directly in a LeetCode environment:



```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

class Solution:
    def largestValsFromLabels(self, values: List[int], labels: List[int], num_wanted: int, use_limit: int) -> int:
        # Create a list of items containing tuples of (value, label)
        items = list(zip(values, labels))
        
        # Sort items by value in descending order
        items.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Dictionary to keep track of the use count of each label
        usage_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        result = 0  # To store the sum of the chosen values
        chosen_count = 0  # To store the count of chosen items
        
        # Iterate through the sorted items list
        for value, label in items:
            # Check if we can add another item to the result
            if chosen_count < num_wanted:
                # Check if adding this item does not exceed the use_limit for this label
                if usage_count[label] < use_limit:
                    # Increment the count for this label
                    usage_count[label] += 1
                    # Add the item's value to the result
                    result += value
                    # Increment the count of chosen items
                    chosen_count += 1
        
        return result

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.largestValsFromLabels([5,4,3,2,1], [1,1,2,2,3], 3, 1))  # Output: 9
print(sol.largestValsFromLabels([5,4,3,2,1], [1,3,3,3,2], 3, 2))  # Output: 12
print(sol.largestValsFromLabels([9,8,8,7,6], [0,0,0,1,1], 3, 1))  # Output: 16
print(sol.largestValsFromLabels([9,8,8,7,6], [0,0,0,1,1], 3, 2))  # Output: 24

```

Explanation:
1. **Data Preparation**: The `items` list pairs each value with its respective label. This transformation helps in sorting and selecting items based on their values while keeping the label associated.
   
2. **Sorting**: After creating the `items` list, it is sorted in descending order based on values. This order allows the algorithm to pick the highest possible values first.

3. **Item Selection**: The selection is made while iterating over the sorted `items` list. A dictionary, `usage_count`, is maintained to track how many times items with a particular label have been added to the subset `S`.
   - For each item, if picking it does not exceed the `use_limit` for its label and the desired number of items `num_wanted` has not been reached, it is added to the result.
   - The value of the item is added to the `result`, and the count of items chosen (`chosen_count`) is incremented.

4. **Output**: After the loop completes, the calculated `result`, which is the sum of the values of the selected items, is returned.

This solution ensures that it picks the highest values while adhering to the constraints posed by `num_wanted` and `use_limit`. The complexity mainly revolves around the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of items. This complexity is suitable given the problem constraints.

# 1133. Largest Unique Number

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `A`, return the largest integer that only occurs once.

If no integer occurs once, return -1.


Example 1:
Input: [5,7,3,9,4,9,8,3,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: 
The maximum integer in the array is 9 but it is repeated. The number 8 occurs only once, so it's the answer.


Example 2:
Input: [9,9,8,8]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no number that occurs only once.

Note:
`1 <= A.length <= 2000`
`0 <= A[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the largest integer that occurs only once in an array, we can use a Python dictionary (hashmap) to track the count of each number. Here are the steps for the algorithm:

1. Traverse the array `A` and use a dictionary to record the count of each number.
2. Traverse the dictionary to identify numbers that have a count of 1.
3. Return the maximum of these numbers.

This approach is efficient as it only requires two traversals through the data—one through the array and one through the dictionary entries. Given the constraints, this solution is feasible.

Here's the complete solution that could be used directly on the LeetCode website:



```python
class Solution:
    def largestUniqueNumber(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store counts of each element
        number_counts = {}
        
        # Counting each element in the list
        for num in A:
            if num in number_counts:
                number_counts[num] += 1
            else:
                number_counts[num] = 1
        
        # Variable to store the maximum number that occurs only once
        max_unique_number = -1
        
        # Check each entry in the dictionary for numbers that appear only once
        for num, count in number_counts.items():
            if count == 1:
                if num > max_unique_number:
                    max_unique_number = num
        
        # Return the maximum unique number, or -1 if none exist
        return max_unique_number

```

### Explanation:

- **Dictionary Usage**: `number_counts` collects how often each number appears in list `A`.
- **First Loop**: Populates `number_counts` with the number as the key and its count as the value.
- **Second Loop**: Checks `number_counts` for numbers that have a count of 1. Updates `max_unique_number` if the number is greater than the current max.

This solution effectively handles scenarios with duplicates, no duplicates, or when no number satisfies the uniqueness condition, returning -1 as required.

# 1138. Alphabet Board Path

### Problem Description 
On an alphabet board, we start at position `(0, 0)`, corresponding to character `board[0][0]`.

Here, `board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"]`, as shown in the diagram below.

We may make the following moves:
`'U'` moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
`'D'` moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
`'L'` moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
`'R'` moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
`'!'` adds the character `board[r][c]` at our current position `(r, c)` to the answer.

(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)
Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to `target` in the minimum number of moves.  You may return any path that does so.


Example 1:
Input: target = "leet"
Output: "DDR!UURRR!!DDD!"

Example 2:
Input: target = "code"
Output: "RR!DDRR!UUL!R!"

Constraints:
`1 <= target.length <= 100`
`target` consists only of English lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we'll create a function that, given a target string, will generate a sequence of moves on the alphabet board that spells out the target word using board navigation commands.

The key steps to implement this solution are:
1. **Create an Efficient Lookup for Letter Coordinates**:
    - Design a dictionary that maps each letter to its board coordinates (row, column).

2. **Move Calculation Between Points**:
    - Based on a current position and a target position, calculate the optimal path to move from current to the target position using the allowed moves ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). 
    - Special attention is required when moving to or from the 'z' character, as 'z' is on a row by itself.

3. **Generating Commands**:
    - For each letter in the target string, find the sequence of moves to get from the current position to the target position of the character and append the '!' command to select the character.

4. **Repeatedly Update Current Position**:
    - Continue the process, updating the current position to the last selected character's position.

Here's a direct implementation that follows this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def alphabetBoardPath(self, target: str) -> str:
        # Create a mapping from character to its (row, col) position
        pos = {chr(i + 97): (i // 5, i % 5) for i in range(26)}
        
        # Tracks the output commands sequence
        result = []
        
        # Start position
        cur_row, cur_col = 0, 0
        
        # Iterate over each character in the target
        for ch in target:
            next_row, next_col = pos[ch]
            
            # Calculate the vertical movement
            while cur_row != next_row:
                if next_row < cur_row:
                    if cur_row == 5 and cur_col != 0:
                        result.append('L')
                        cur_col -= 1
                    else:
                        result.append('U')
                        cur_row -= 1
                elif next_row > cur_row:
                    if cur_row == 4 and next_row == 5:
                        result.append('D')
                        cur_row += 1
                        while cur_col > 0:
                            result.append('L')
                            cur_col -= 1
                    else:
                        result.append('D')
                        cur_row += 1
            
            # Calculate the horizontal movement
            while cur_col != next_col:
                if next_col < cur_col:
                    result.append('L')
                    cur_col -= 1
                elif next_col > cur_col:
                    result.append('R')
                    cur_col += 1
            
            # Select the character
            result.append('!')
        
        return ''.join(result)

# Example Usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.alphabetBoardPath("leet"))  # Expected output: sequence of moves that spells "leet"
print(sol.alphabetBoardPath("code"))  # Expected output: sequence of moves that spells "code"

```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `alphabetBoardPath` which takes a target string and returns the sequence of moves. To optimize the path finding, the function first figures out vertical movements and then the horizontal movements, taking care to navigate the differing dimensions on the board, particularly around the row containing the letter 'z'. For each letter, it adds a '!' after reaching the correct position. The solution is efficient for the board's constraints and performs well for the problem's limits.

# 1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern

### Problem Description 
We are given some website visits: the user with name `username[i]` visited the website `website[i]` at time `timestamp[i]`.

A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)
Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.


Example 1:
Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]
Explanation: 
The tuples in this example are:
["joe", 1, "home"]
["joe", 2, "about"]
["joe", 3, "career"]
["james", 4, "home"]
["james", 5, "cart"]
["james", 6, "maps"]
["james", 7, "home"]
["mary", 8, "home"]
["mary", 9, "about"]
["mary", 10, "career"]
The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.

The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.

The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.

The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.

The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.

Note:
`3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50`
`1 <= username[i].length <= 10`
`0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9`
`1 <= website[i].length <= 10`
Both `username[i]` and `website[i]` contain only lowercase characters.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3 websites.

No user visits two websites at the same time.

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution for the specified problem, following the LeetCode format. This solution focuses on collecting the data in a usable structure, generating all valid 3-sequences for each user, and counting the occurrences across different users to determine the most popular (or lexicographically smallest) sequence.



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import combinations

class Solution:
    def mostVisitedPattern(self, username, timestamp, website):
        # Data aggregation by user
        user_data = defaultdict(list)
        for user, time, site in sorted(zip(username, timestamp, website), key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1])):
            user_data[user].append(site)
        
        # Generate all 3-sequences for each user
        seq_count = defaultdict(set)
        for user, sites in user_data.items():
            if len(sites) < 3:
                continue
            unique_seqs = set(combinations(sites, 3))
            for seq in unique_seqs:
                seq_count[seq].add(user)
        
        # Determine the most popular sequence (or lexicographically smallest if a tie)
        max_visits = 0
        result_seq = None
        for seq, users in seq_count.items():
            if len(users) > max_visits or (len(users) == max_visits and seq < result_seq):
                max_visits = len(users)
                result_seq = seq
        
        return list(result_seq)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"]
timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
print(solution.mostVisitedPattern(username, timestamp, website))

```

### Explanation:

1. **Aggregating Data**:
    - The information from users, timestamps, and websites are merged and sorted based on usernames and the respective timestamps.
    - The data are kept in a dictionary where each username points to a list of websites visited in chronological order (`user_data`).

2. **Generating 3-Sequences**:
    - Using `itertools.combinations`, this piece of code generates all possible combinations of 3 websites visited in sequence by each user.
    - A `set` is used for each user to avoid counting repeated sequences more than once for the same user.
    - A dictionary (`seq_count`) tracks which users visited each 3-sequence.

3. **Finding the Most Popular 3-Sequence**:
    - The code iterates through all generated 3-sequences to compute the number of unique users. It keeps track of the sequence that has been visited by the maximum number of users.
    - If there's a tie in counts, it checks for lexicographical order to choose the smallest one.
  
This solution is efficient given the constraints and organizes the process in an easy-to-follow manner. The use of sorting, aggregration, combinations, and effective counting with sets ensures both correctness and efficiency.

# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.


Example 2:
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.

Note:
`1 <= words.length <= 1000`
`1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can follow several straightforward steps:

1. **Character Counting for `chars`:** First, create a frequency dictionary (`chars_count`) that counts the occurrence of each character in the `chars` string. This allows us to know how many times we can use each character from `chars`.

2. **Checking Each Word:** For each word in the list `words`, we'll create a frequency dictionary of the characters in that word. Then, we compare this dictionary with our `chars_count` to decide if the word can be built using the characters from `chars` without exceeding their available counts.

3. **Summing Lengths:** If a word can be built with the characters from `chars`, we add up the length of that word to a running total. This total will eventually be our result.

4. **Result:** Once all words have been checked, we return the total sum.

This logic can be implemented using basic Python structures like dictionaries for frequency counting and loops for checking each word against the available characters. Given the constraints (string and array sizes), this approach is efficient enough.

Let's implement this in Python with a function:



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        def canConstruct(word, char_count):
            word_count = Counter(word)
            # Check if for every char in the word, the usage count is not more than the available in chars
            for c in word_count:
                if word_count[c] > char_count.get(c, 0):
                    return False
            return True
        
        chars_count = Counter(chars)
        total_length = 0
        
        for word in words:
            if canConstruct(word, chars_count):
                total_length += len(word)
                
        return total_length

```

This should be a correct implementation under the given constraints, and it would work directly if run on a compatible environment (like LeetCode) where Python standard libraries and functions are supported. The `List` type needs to be imported from `typing` (`from typing import List`) to be recognized in this raw Python script format outside of specifically configured environments.

# 1166. Design File System

### Problem Description 
You are asked to design a file system that allows you to create new paths and associate them with different values.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `/` followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, "`/leetcode"` and "`/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string `""` and `"/"` are not.

Implement the `FileSystem` class:
`bool createPath(string path, int value)` Creates a new `path` and associates a `value` to it if possible and returns `true`. Returns `false` if the path already exists or its parent path doesn't exist.

`int get(string path)` Returns the value associated with `path` or returns `-1` if the path doesn't exist.


Example 1:
Input: 
["FileSystem","createPath","get"]
[[],["/a",1],["/a"]]
Output: 
[null,true,1]
Explanation: 
FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();
fileSystem.createPath("/a", 1); // return true
fileSystem.get("/a"); // return 1

Example 2:
Input: 
["FileSystem","createPath","createPath","get","createPath","get"]
[[],["/leet",1],["/leet/code",2],["/leet/code"],["/c/d",1],["/c"]]
Output: 
[null,true,true,2,false,-1]
Explanation: 
FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();
fileSystem.createPath("/leet", 1); // return true
fileSystem.createPath("/leet/code", 2); // return true
fileSystem.get("/leet/code"); // return 2
fileSystem.createPath("/c/d", 1); // return false because the parent path "/c" doesn't exist.

fileSystem.get("/c"); // return -1 because this path doesn't exist.


Constraints:
The number of calls to the two functions is less than or equal to `104` in total.

`2 <= path.length <= 100`
`1 <= value <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we'll implement the `FileSystem` class with two methods: `createPath(string path, int value)` and `get(string path)`. The class structure will involve a dictionary to store paths and their associated values. This dictionary will enable fast lookup and insertion operations which are necessary given the constraints.

Here's how we'll implement each method:
1. **createPath(string path, int value)**: 
   - First, check if the path already exists in the dictionary. If it does, return `False`.
   - Then, verify if the parent directory exists, which is necessary to create a new valid path. If the parent doesn't exist (and it's not the root path "/"), return `False`.
   - If validations pass, add the path to the dictionary with the given value and return `True`.
 
2. **get(string path)**:
   - Simply check if the path exists in the dictionary. If it does, return the associated `value`. If not, return `-1`.

This direct dictionary lookup method ensures the operations are efficient.



```python
class FileSystem:

    def __init__(self):
        self.pathMap = {}
        self.pathMap['/'] = None  # represents the root

    def createPath(self, path: str, value: int) -> bool:
        if path in self.pathMap:
            return False  # Path already exists.
        
        # Check if parent path exists
        last_slash_index = path.rfind('/')
        parent_path = path[:last_slash_index]
        
        if parent_path != '' and parent_path not in self.pathMap:
            return False  # Parent path does not exist.
    
        # Valid parent, so create the path
        self.pathMap[path] = value
        return True

    def get(self, path: str) -> int:
        if path in self.pathMap:
            return self.pathMap[path]
        return -1  # Path does not exist

# Your FileSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = FileSystem()
# param_1 = obj.createPath(path,value)
# param_2 = obj.get(path)

```

### Testing the implementation:
To use this directly on a platform like LeetCode:
- First, you would instantiate the `FileSystem`.
- Then, you would sequentially execute the methods based on the instructions provided in the example test cases.
The solution structure provided is designed to support direct execution with the given problem's specifications and constraints.

# 1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle

### Problem Description 
With respect to a given `puzzle` string, a `word` is valid if both the following conditions are satisfied:
`word` contains the first letter of `puzzle`.

For each letter in `word`, that letter is in `puzzle`.

	For example, if the puzzle is "abcdefg", then valid words are "faced", "cabbage", and "baggage"; while invalid words are "beefed" (doesn't include "a") and "based" (includes "s" which isn't in the puzzle).

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of words in the given word list `words` that are valid with respect to the puzzle `puzzles[i]`.


Example :
Input: 
words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"], 
puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
Output: [1,1,3,2,4,0]
Explanation:
1 valid word for "aboveyz" : "aaaa" 
1 valid word for "abrodyz" : "aaaa"
3 valid words for "abslute" : "aaaa", "asas", "able"
2 valid words for "absoryz" : "aaaa", "asas"
4 valid words for "actresz" : "aaaa", "asas", "actt", "access"
There're no valid words for "gaswxyz" cause none of the words in the list contains letter 'g'.


Constraints:
`1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
`4 <= words[i].length <= 50`
`1 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4`
`puzzles[i].length == 7`
`words[i][j]`, `puzzles[i][j]` are English lowercase letters.

Each `puzzles[i] `doesn't contain repeated characters.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem presented, we can optimize our approach by using bitwise operations instead of iterating over every character for every word and puzzle pair. By converting each string of `words` and `puzzles` into a bit representation where each bit corresponds to a letter from 'a' to 'z', we simplify the inclusion/exclusion check to bitwise operations which are computationally more efficient.

Here's the plan:

1. Convert each word in the `words` list to a bitmask representation, where the mask has a length of 26 (for each letter in the English alphabet). A bitmask will have a bit set if the character corresponding to the bit's position is present in the word.
  
2. Similarly, convert each puzzle into bitmask form, considering just the 7 letters per puzzle.

3. Create a dictionary `word_count` where the key is the bitmask of a word and the value is the number of times this bitmask appears among the listed words.

4. For each puzzle, count the valid words by:
   - Checking all subsets of the puzzle bitmask which include the first letter of the puzzle (since valid words will always have to contain the first letter of the puzzle).
   - Checking if these subsets match any word bitmasks which are present in our dictionary `word_count`.

We will use the `bin()` function to ensure that the computational complexity is manageable relative to the 7 letters in each puzzle.

Let's implement and encapsulate the logic within a Python class suitable for quick integration on platforms like LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def findNumOfValidWords(self, words: List[str], puzzles: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Helper function to convert word to bitmask
        def bitmask(word):
            mask = 0
            for char in word:
                # Set the bit corresponding to char in the mask
                mask |= (1 << (ord(char) - ord('a')))
            return mask
        
        # Count frequency of each unique word bitmask
        word_count = defaultdict(int)
        for word in words:
            word_count[bitmask(word)] += 1
        
        # Helper to calculate the valid words for given puzzle
        def valid_word_count(puzzle):
            first_letter_mask = 1 << (ord(puzzle[0]) - ord('a'))
            puzzle_mask = bitmask(puzzle)
            count = 0
            
            # Iterate over all subsets of puzzle_mask that include the first letter
            subset = puzzle_mask
            while subset:
                if subset & first_letter_mask:  # Check if the first letter is in the subset
                    # Only add count if this subset is a valid word bitmask we've seen
                    count += word_count[subset]
                # Moves to the next subset, removing one bit at a time, including the first letter mask
                subset = (subset - 1) & puzzle_mask
            
            # Special case to handle the subset that is exactly the first letter
            if first_letter_mask & puzzle_mask:
                count += word_count[first_letter_mask]
            
            return count
        
        # Get the valid word count for each puzzle and return as a list
        return [valid_word_count(puzzle) for puzzle in puzzles]


```

This code transforms both words and puzzles into bitmasks denoting the presence of each character. It then counts how many of these word bitmasks can form subsets of the puzzle bitmask (while mandatorily including the first letter of the puzzle). Furthermore, the class `Solution` with method `findNumOfValidWords` can be easily run on platforms like LeetCode with the provided test cases.


# 1189. Maximum Number of Balloons

### Problem Description 
Given a string `text`, you want to use the characters of `text` to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.

You can use each character in `text` at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.


Example 1:
Input: text = "nlaebolko"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: text = "loonbalxballpoon"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: text = "leetcode"
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= text.length <= 10^4`
`text` consists of lower case English letters only.

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution using a frequency count method to determine how many times the word "balloon" can be formed from the characters in the given string `text`. This Python code follows the format compatible with the LeetCode platform, including the use of a class with a method `maxNumberOfBalloons`.

**Python Code:**



```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        # Frequency map for the word "balloon"
        freq_balloon = {'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 2, 'n': 1}
        
        # Frequency map for characters in the text
        freq_text = {}
        for char in text:
            if char in freq_balloon:  # Store only the relevant characters
                if char in freq_text:
                    freq_text[char] += 1
                else:
                    freq_text[char] = 1

        # Compute the maximum number of times we can form the word "balloon"
        max_balloons = float('inf')
        for char in freq_balloon:
            if char in freq_text:
                max_balloons = min(max_balloons, freq_text[char] // freq_balloon[char])
            else:
                max_balloons = 0  # If any character is not present, cannot form the word even once
        
        return max_balloons

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxNumberOfBalloons("nlaebolko"))  # Output: 1
print(sol.maxNumberOfBalloons("loonbalxballpoon"))  # Output: 2
print(sol.maxNumberOfBalloons("leetcode"))  # Output: 0

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Character Frequency Count:** We start by counting the frequency of each character in the string `text` that is relevant to forming the word "balloon" (i.e., 'b', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'n') using a dictionary `freq_text`.

2. **Comparison with Required Frequency:** The word "balloon" requires specific counts of each character to be formed once (e.g., 2 'l's, 2 'o's). These required counts are stored in `freq_balloon`. 

3. **Compute Maximum Instances:** For each character needed to form "balloon", the code checks how many times that character's count in `text` can cover its requirement in "balloon". The minimum ratio across all relevant characters determines the maximum number of times "balloon" can be formed.

4. **Output the Result:** The method `maxNumberOfBalloons` returns the calculated maximum number.

This solution efficiently computes the result with a time complexity of \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the string `text`, due to the single pass required to count the characters and a constant-time operation to compute the minimum ratio.

# 1198. Find Smallest Common Element in All Rows

### Problem Description 
Given an `m x n` matrix `mat` where every row is sorted in strictly increasing order, return the smallest common element in all rows.

If there is no common element, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[2,3,5]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
`m == mat.length`
`n == mat[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 500`
`1 <= mat[i][j] <= 104`
`mat[i]` is sorted in strictly increasing order.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can use a frequency counter approach - essentially tracking how frequently elements appear across all rows in the matrix. Since each row is sorted, we can go through each element of the first row, and use it as a candidate to check its presence in all other rows using binary search to maintain efficiency.

### Steps:

1. Take each element from the first row as it is already sorted.
2. For each element, perform binary search in the other rows to check if the element exists.
3. If the element exists in every row, it is a common element. Track the minimum of these common elements.
4. If no common element is found, return -1.

We will use Python with the aim that this solution fits the LeetCode format. For binary search, Python's `bisect` module (`bisect_left`) provides a handy way to implement it directly.

Here is the implementation:



```python
from typing import List
import bisect

class Solution:
    def smallestCommonElement(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not mat:
            return -1
        
        # Function to check if 'num' is present in 'row' using binary search
        def has_element(row, num):
            index = bisect.bisect_left(row, num)
            return index < len(row) and row[index] == num

        # Iterate through each number in the first row
        row1 = mat[0]
        for number in row1:
            # Check presence of the number in all other rows
            if all(has_element(mat[i], number) for i in range(1, len(mat))):
                return number  # Found the smallest common element
        
        return -1  # No common element was found

# Test cases
sol = Solution()
print(sol.smallestCommonElement([[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]))  # Output: 5
print(sol.smallestCommonElement([[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[2,3,5]]))  # Output: 2

```

### Explanation:
- **Line 6-8**: Define a helper function `has_element` that, given a `row` and a number `num`, determines if `num` exists in `row` using binary search (`bisect_left`).
- **Line 11-19**: Iterate over each number in the first row and check its presence in every other row using `has_element`. If there's an element common to all rows, it's returned immediately since we're iterating from the smallest to largest in the first row, ensuring the first found is the smallest.
- The algorithm benefits from the guarantee that each row is sorted, making binary search an efficient choice. Since the number of rows `m` can go up to 500 and the lengths `n` also up to 500, the operations remain efficient. Each number from the first row results in `O(m log n)` complexity due to binary searches, thus making the overall complexity `O(n * m log n)`. This is efficient enough given the constraint sizes.

This code is designed to be directly paste-able and usable on LeetCode for the corresponding problem statement.

# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `arr`, write a function that returns `true` if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
`-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 The problem asks to determine whether the frequency of each element in the input array is unique. To achieve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the occurrences of each element using a dictionary (hash map).
2. Verify that the frequencies are unique. This can be done using another set to track the already encountered frequencies.

Below is a Python implementation of this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Count frequencies of each element
        frequency_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            if num in frequency_map:
                frequency_map[num] += 1
            else:
                frequency_map[num] = 1
        
        # Step 2: Check for unique occurrences
        unique_frequencies = set()
        for count in frequency_map.values():
            if count in unique_frequencies:
                return False
            unique_frequencies.add(count)
        
        return True

# Use the below test cases to verify the solution
# (the instance and method calls can be used in LeetCode directly):
# Test cases
sol = Solution()
print(sol.uniqueOccurrences([1,2,2,1,1,3]))  # Output: true
print(sol.uniqueOccurrences([1,2]))           # Output: false
print(sol.uniqueOccurrences([-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]))  # Output: true

```

### Explanation:

1. **Frequency Map**: We initialize `frequency_map` as an empty dictionary. We loop through each element in `arr`. For each element, if it is already in our dictionary, we increment its count. Otherwise, we set its count to 1.

2. **Set for Unique Frequencies**: We initialize `unique_frequencies` as an empty set to keep track of frequencies already seen. We then iterate through the values of our `frequency_map` (the frequencies of each number). If any frequency is found in our `unique_frequencies` set (meaning this frequency was already seen before for another number), we return `False` indicating that there's a duplicate frequency. If not, we add it to the set.

3. **Return Value**: If we pass through all frequencies without finding duplicates, then the function returns `True`, signaling unique frequencies for all numbers in the array.

This solution efficiently satisfies the requirement by leveraging dictionaries and sets, common tools for handling frequency counts and ensuring uniqueness in tasks like this one. It operates in `O(N)` time complexity where `N` is the number of elements in `arr`, because each element is processed a constant number of times.

# 1213. Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays

### Problem Description 
Given three integer arrays `arr1`, `arr2` and `arr3` sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.


Example 1:
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.


Example 2:
Input: arr1 = [197,418,523,876,1356], arr2 = [501,880,1593,1710,1870], arr3 = [521,682,1337,1395,1764]
Output: []

Constraints:
`1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000`
`1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem on LeetCode in Python, we can use a triple-pointer approach due to the fact that all three arrays are sorted in strictly increasing order. Using three pointers allows us to efficiently traverse the arrays without the necessity of extra space for storing intermediate results or duplicating the data. Here’s the plan:

1. Initialize three pointers, each set to the start of `arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3` respectively.
2. Use a while loop to iterate as long as none of the pointers have exceeded the length of their respective arrays.
3. Compare the elements at the locations of the three pointers.
4. If all three elements are the same, that means it's a common element. Add it to the result list and increment all pointers.
5. If the elements aren't the same, increment the pointer pointing to the smallest element, since we need to "catch up" in order to find a match.

This approach ensures that we only traverse each array once, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(n_1 + n_2 + n_3)\), where \(n_1\), \(n_2\), and \(n_3\) are the lengths of `arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3`, respectively.

Let us proceed to translate this plan into Python code, following the described approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def arraysIntersection(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int], arr3: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize pointers for arr1, arr2, arr3
        i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
        result = []
        
        # Loop through all three arrays
        while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2) and k < len(arr3):
            # Current elements
            a1, a2, a3 = arr1[i], arr2[j], arr3[k]
            
            # Check if all match
            if a1 == a2 == a3:
                result.append(a1)
                i += 1
                j += 1
                k += 1
            # Increment the smallest value's pointer
            elif a1 < a2:
                i += 1
            elif a2 < a3:
                j += 1
            else:
                k += 1
        
        return result

```

This solution should run directly on the LeetCode platform, following the expected format and constraints. It efficiently finds common elements by iterating over the arrays only once.

# 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 105`
`-104 <= arr[i], difference <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem, we can leverage the concept of dynamic programming. The idea is to use a hash map (`dp`) to keep track of the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence that ends with a given number. This hash map will have keys as the numbers of the array, and the values will be the length of the longest subsequence ending at that number.

For each number in the array, we will:
1. Compute the number that could precede it in an arithmetic sequence with the given difference, i.e., `previous = current_number - difference`.
2. Check if this previous number exists in the hash map. If it does, it implies that we can extend the subsequence ending with this previous number to include the current number. We then update the length of the longest subsequence ending at `current_number` in the hash map.
3. If the previous number does not exist in the hash map, it means the current number itself could be the start of a new arithmetic subsequence. Initialize this in our hash map.

By the end of our iteration, the value that will hold the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence will be the maximum value across our hash map.

I'll provide a Python implementation for this approach.



```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, arr: List[int], difference: int) -> int:
        dp = {}
        max_length = 0
        
        for number in arr:
            if number - difference in dp:
                dp[number] = dp[number - difference] + 1
            else:
                dp[number] = 1
            
            max_length = max(max_length, dp[number])
        
        return max_length

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.longestSubsequence([1,2,3,4], 1))  # Output: 4
# print(sol.longestSubsequence([1,3,5,7], 1))  # Output: 1
# print(sol.longestSubsequence([1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], -2))  # Output: 4

```

This solution iterates through the list `arr` once, which gives it a time complexity of \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in `arr`. The space complexity of the solution is also \(O(N)\) due to the usage of the hash map `dp` which in the worst case might contain as many entries as the number of unique elements in `arr`. This is optimal for the problem constraints provided.

# 1224. Maximum Equal Frequency

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums` of positive integers, return the longest possible length of an array prefix of `nums`, such that it is possible to remove exactly one element from this prefix so that every number that has appeared in it will have the same number of occurrences.

If after removing one element there are no remaining elements, it's still considered that every appeared number has the same number of ocurrences (0).


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,5,3,3,5]
Output: 7
Explanation: For the subarray [2,2,1,1,5,3,3] of length 7, if we remove nums[4]=5, we will get [2,2,1,1,3,3], so that each number will appear exactly twice.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]
Output: 13

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: 5

Example 4:
Input: nums = [10,2,8,9,3,8,1,5,2,3,7,6]
Output: 8

Constraints:
`2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution 
 This problem can be effectively addressed by utilizing a hash map to count the frequency of each number as we iterate through the array, along with another hash map to maintain counts of these frequencies. In this solution, the goal is to determine the longest prefix of the array where we can remove exactly one element so that all remaining numbers have the same frequency.

### Algorithm:
1. Use a hash map `count` to store the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Use another hash map `freq` to store how many numbers have a given frequency.
3. As we analyze elements from the start, we dynamically update both hash maps.
4. After each update, we need to check the condition where exactly one element can be removed to make the remaining elements of equal frequency:
   - Case 1: All numbers have the same frequency.
   - Case 2: All numbers have the same frequency except for one extra number, which can be removed to equalize the frequencies.
   - Case 3: All numbers have the same frequency except for one number which has frequency one more than the others, and there's only one such number.
5. If any of these conditions meet, we update our result for the maximum prefix length.

Given these steps, we can implement this in the solution.

### LeetCode Solution Format (Python Code):



```python
class Solution:
    def maxEqualFreq(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        count = defaultdict(int)
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        max_freq = 0
        result = 0
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Update the occurrences of the current number
            if count[num]:
                freq[count[num]] -= 1
            count[num] += 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, count[num])
            freq[count[num]] += 1
            
            # Check if the current prefix can be balanced by removing one element
            # Possible conditions to satisfy removing one element to balance:
            # 1. All elements have the same frequency
            # 2. All but one element has the same frequency, and there's one extra of one kind
            # 3. One element has 1 frequency more than others which all are the same, and there's only one such number
            total_elements = i + 1
            if (max_freq == 1 or
                (freq[max_freq] * max_freq + freq[max_freq - 1] * (max_freq - 1) == total_elements and freq[max_freq] == 1) or
                (freq[1] == 1 and freq[max_freq] * max_freq == total_elements - 1)):
                result = total_elements
        
        return result

```

In the above solution, the hash maps (`count` and `freq`) provide an efficient way to adjust and check the conditions at every step of iterating through the array. The time complexity is O(n) because each element is processed once, and space complexity is O(n) for storing counts and frequencies.

This implementation should work well within the constraints and solves the problem directly in the expected LeetCode format.

# 1244. Design A Leaderboard

### Problem Description 
Design a Leaderboard class, which has 3 functions:
`addScore(playerId, score)`: Update the leaderboard by adding `score` to the given player's score. If there is no player with such id in the leaderboard, add him to the leaderboard with the given `score`.

`top(K)`: Return the score sum of the top `K` players.

`reset(playerId)`: Reset the score of the player with the given id to 0 (in other words erase it from the leaderboard). It is guaranteed that the player was added to the leaderboard before calling this function.

Initially, the leaderboard is empty.


Example 1:
Input: 
["Leaderboard","addScore","addScore","addScore","addScore","addScore","top","reset","reset","addScore","top"]
[[],[1,73],[2,56],[3,39],[4,51],[5,4],[1],[1],[2],[2,51],[3]]
Output: 
[null,null,null,null,null,null,73,null,null,null,141]
Explanation: 
Leaderboard leaderboard = new Leaderboard ();
leaderboard.addScore(1,73);   // leaderboard = [[1,73]];
leaderboard.addScore(2,56);   // leaderboard = [[1,73],[2,56]];
leaderboard.addScore(3,39);   // leaderboard = [[1,73],[2,56],[3,39]];
leaderboard.addScore(4,51);   // leaderboard = [[1,73],[2,56],[3,39],[4,51]];
leaderboard.addScore(5,4);    // leaderboard = [[1,73],[2,56],[3,39],[4,51],[5,4]];
leaderboard.top(1);           // returns 73;
leaderboard.reset(1);         // leaderboard = [[2,56],[3,39],[4,51],[5,4]];
leaderboard.reset(2);         // leaderboard = [[3,39],[4,51],[5,4]];
leaderboard.addScore(2,51);   // leaderboard = [[2,51],[3,39],[4,51],[5,4]];
leaderboard.top(3);           // returns 141 = 51 + 51 + 39;

Constraints:
`1 <= playerId, K <= 10000`
It's guaranteed that `K` is less than or equal to the current number of players.

`1 <= score <= 100`
There will be at most `1000` function calls.

### Solution 
 Here's a Python class `Leaderboard` implemented to solve the problem as described. This class uses a dictionary to keep track of player scores and leverages Python's sorting features to retrieve the top K scores efficiently.



```python
class Leaderboard:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use a dictionary to store player scores.
        self.scores = {}

    def addScore(self, playerId: int, score: int) -> None:
        # If the player is already on the leaderboard, add the score to the existing score.
        # If not, create a new entry for the player with the given score.
        if playerId in self.scores:
            self.scores[playerId] += score
        else:
            self.scores[playerId] = score

    def top(self, K: int) -> int:
        # Retrieve the top K scores by sorting the values and taking the sum of the highest K scores.
        # Since we take all values and sort them, this might not be super efficient and
        # there are more optimal ways in a more production-ready system, especially with extremely large datasets.
        return sum(sorted(self.scores.values(), reverse=True)[:K])

    def reset(self, playerId: int) -> None:
        # Reset the score of the specified player by deleting the player from the scores dictionary.
        # According to the constraints, the player exists, so no need to check existence.
        if playerId in self.scores:
            del self.scores[playerId]

# Example Usage:
# Your Leaderboard object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Leaderboard()
# obj.addScore(playerId,score)
# param_2 = obj.top(K)
# obj.reset(playerId)

# Enable the testing of the class based on the example provided
def test_leaderboard():
    leaderboard = Leaderboard()
    leaderboard.addScore(1, 73)
    leaderboard.addScore(2, 56)
    leaderboard.addScore(3, 39)
    leaderboard.addScore(4, 51)
    leaderboard.addScore(5, 4)
    assert leaderboard.top(1) == 73
    leaderboard.reset(1)
    leaderboard.reset(2)
    leaderboard.addScore(2, 51)
    assert leaderboard.top(3) == 141
    print("All test cases pass")
    
test_leaderboard()

```

### Explanatory Notes:

1. **Data Structure:** The use of a dictionary (`self.scores`) allows for efficient look-up, addition, and deletion of player scores, capitalizing on average O(1) time complexity for these operations.

2. **Efficiency:** 
   - The `addScore` and `reset` methods operate in constant time O(1).
   - The `top` function sorts the scores which in the worst case (where all player scores are updated or added) operates in O(N log N), where N is the number of players. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

3. **Sorting in `top`:** 
   - We are creating a list of scores and sorting them in descending order. We then sum up the top K elements of this sorted list. Python's Timsort, the underlying algorithm of the sort function, is very efficient for partially ordered data, which can often be the case in ongoing score updates.

The above implementation fulfills the required operations as outlined by the problem statement and handles all operations within acceptable limits for the given constraints.

# 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a binary tree with the following rules:
`root.val == 0`
If `treeNode.val == x` and `treeNode.left != null`, then `treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1`
If `treeNode.val == x` and `treeNode.right != null`, then `treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2`
Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all `treeNode.val` have been changed to `-1`.

You need to first recover the binary tree and then implement the `FindElements` class:
`FindElements(TreeNode* root)` Initializes the object with a contamined binary tree, you need to recover it first.

`bool find(int target)` Return if the `target` value exists in the recovered binary tree.


Example 1:
Input
["FindElements","find","find"]
[[[-1,null,-1]],[1],[2]]
Output
[null,false,true]
Explanation
FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,null,-1]); 
findElements.find(1); // return False 
findElements.find(2); // return True 

Example 2:
Input
["FindElements","find","find","find"]
[[[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]],[1],[3],[5]]
Output
[null,true,true,false]
Explanation
FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]);
findElements.find(1); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return True
findElements.find(5); // return False

Example 3:
Input
["FindElements","find","find","find","find"]
[[[-1,null,-1,-1,null,-1]],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Output
[null,true,false,false,true]
Explanation
FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,null,-1,-1,null,-1]);
findElements.find(2); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return False
findElements.find(4); // return False
findElements.find(5); // return True

Constraints:
`TreeNode.val == -1`
The height of the binary tree is less than or equal to `20`
The total number of nodes is between `[1, 10^4]`
Total calls of `find()` is between `[1, 10^4]`
`0 <= target <= 10^6`

### Solution 
 To address the problem, we will implement a `FindElements` class in Python with the following steps:

1. **Initialize and Recover Tree**: During initialization (`__init__` method), we will reconstruct the tree by assigning correct values starting from the root, assuming the root should have a value of `0`. We'll perform this using a BFS (Breadth-First Search). Every node's left child is valued at `2*x + 1` and the right child at `2*x + 2` where `x` is the current node's value.

2. **Set for Fast Lookup**: To answer the `find` queries efficiently, we maintain a set containing all values in the recovered tree. We populate this set while reconstructing the tree.

3. **Find Operation**: The `find` function simply checks for the existence of a value in the set, providing a quick O(1) lookup time.

Here's the python code based on the description above:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):

Your solution defines the `FindElements` class, reconstructs the tree values, and performs efficient "find" operations using a set for direct membership tests. This approach strikes a good balance between time complexity for initialization and quick lookup times for the `find` method.

# 1311. Get Watched Videos by Your Friends

### Problem Description 
There are `n` people, each person has a unique id between `0` and `n-1`. Given the arrays `watchedVideos` and `friends`, where `watchedVideos[i]` and `friends[i]` contain the list of watched videos and the list of friends respectively for the person with `id = i`.

Level 1 of videos are all watched videos by your friends, level 2 of videos are all watched videos by the friends of your friends and so on. In general, the level `k` of videos are all watched videos by people with the shortest path exactly equal to `k` with you. Given your `id` and the `level` of videos, return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). For videos with the same frequency order them alphabetically from least to greatest. 

Example 1:
Input: watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 1
Output: ["B","C"] 
Explanation: 
You have id = 0 (green color in the figure) and your friends are (yellow color in the figure):
Person with id = 1 -> watchedVideos = ["C"] 
Person with id = 2 -> watchedVideos = ["B","C"] 
The frequencies of watchedVideos by your friends are: 
B -> 1 
C -> 2

Example 2:
Input: watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 2
Output: ["D"]
Explanation: 
You have id = 0 (green color in the figure) and the only friend of your friends is the person with id = 3 (yellow color in the figure).


Constraints:
`n == watchedVideos.length == friends.length`
`2 <= n <= 100`
`1 <= watchedVideos[i].length <= 100`
`1 <= watchedVideos[i][j].length <= 8`
`0 <= friends[i].length < n`
`0 <= friends[i][j] < n`
`0 <= id < n`
`1 <= level < n`
if `friends[i]` contains `j`, then `friends[j]` contains `i`

### Solution 
 The problem requires us to discover the videos watched by people who are `k` levels (friends of friends, etc.) apart from a given user in a social network, and return them sorted by their frequencies and alphabetically for those with the same frequency.

To solve the problem, we can utilize a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach which is suitable for finding shortest paths and levels in a graph-like structure. 

The main steps in the solution would be:
1. **Starting BFS**: Start BFS from the given user `id`, marking them as visited.
2. **Tracking Levels**: As we visit each node (person) in BFS, track the level or distance from the starting node `id`.
3. **Collecting Videos**: At the specified level `k`, collect all the videos watched by the users found at that level.
4. **Counting Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each video from the collected list.
5. **Sorting Videos**: Sort the videos first by frequency, then alphabetically.
6. **Return Result**: Return the sorted list of videos.

Here's the code based on this approach:



```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class Solution:
    def watchedVideosByFriends(self, watchedVideos: List[List[str]], friends: List[List[int]], id: int, level: int) -> List[str]:
        n = len(watchedVideos)
        visited = [False] * n
        queue = deque([(id, 0)])
        visited[id] = True
        video_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        while queue:
            person, curr_level = queue.popleft()
            
            if curr_level == level:
                for video in watchedVideos[person]:
                    video_count[video] += 1
            
            elif curr_level < level:
                for friend in friends[person]:
                    if not visited[friend]:
                        visited[friend] = True
                        queue.append((friend, curr_level + 1))
        
        # Gathering results and sorting
        result = sorted(video_count.items(), key=lambda item: (item[1], item[0]))
        
        # Extract only the video names sorted by frequency and then alphabetically
        return [video for video, count in result]

# Example use
# sol = Solution()
# result = sol.watchedVideosByFriends([["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], 0, 1)
# print(result)  # Output: ["B","C"]

```

**Explanation**:
- Use a queue to perform BFS starting at `id`. Track the level of each person visited.
- Use a boolean list `visited` to prevent revisiting nodes and to keep track of the level more accurately.
- A dictionary `video_count` is used to count occurrences of each video at the target level.
- The videos are then sorted primarily by their frequency and secondarily (if frequencies are the same) alphabetically.
- This code correctly implements the BFS to find friends at exactly `k` distance and then analyze the frequency of their watched videos accordingly.

# 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

### Problem Description 
Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid `j's` such that `j != i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.

For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).


Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

Constraints:
`2 <= nums.length <= 500`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 Here's a Python solution that can be directly run on LeetCode. The solution optimally leverages the constraints especially the range of `nums[i]` being between 0 and 100.



```python
class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Creating a frequency array for numbers 0 to 100
        freq = [0] * 101
        
        # Fill frequency array with counts of each number in nums
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        # Calculate prefix sums to determine the count of numbers less than the current number
        for i in range(1, 101):
            freq[i] += freq[i - 1]
        
        # Prepare the result array
        result = []
        
        # Calculate result for each number in nums
        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                # There are no numbers less than 0
                result.append(0)
            else:
                # freq[num-1] will give count of numbers less than num
                result.append(freq[num - 1])
        
        return result

```

### Explanation:
1. **Frequency Array**: We first build a frequency array `freq`, where `freq[i]` represents how many times the integer `i` appears in `nums`.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Transformation**: We convert the `freq` array into a cumulative sum array, such that `freq[i]` now contains the count of numbers that are less than or equal to `i`. By doing this, `freq[i-1]` will give the count of numbers strictly less than `i`.

3. **Result Calculation**: For each number in `nums`, the count of numbers smaller than that specific number is directly given by `freq[num-1]`, unless the number is 0 (in which case it is directly 0 since no number is smaller than 0).

### Performance:
This approach is efficient because:
- It first processes the input in `O(n)` where `n` is length of `nums`.
- The prefix sum transformation is `O(100)`, a fixed cost regardless of input size.
- Finally, deriving the result is `O(n)`.
Overall complexity is thus predominantly `O(n)` making it suitable for the problem's constraints.

# 1418. Display Table of Food Orders in a Restaurant

### Problem Description 
Given the array `orders`, which represents the orders that customers have done in a restaurant. More specifically `orders[i]=[customerNamei,tableNumberi,foodItemi]` where `customerNamei` is the name of the customer, `tableNumberi` is the table customer sit at, and `foodItemi` is the item customer orders.

Return the restaurant's “display table”. The “display table” is a table whose row entries denote how many of each food item each table ordered. The first column is the table number and the remaining columns correspond to each food item in alphabetical order. The first row should be a header whose first column is “Table”, followed by the names of the food items. Note that the customer names are not part of the table. Additionally, the rows should be sorted in numerically increasing order.


Example 1:
Input: orders = [["David","3","Ceviche"],["Corina","10","Beef Burrito"],["David","3","Fried Chicken"],["Carla","5","Water"],["Carla","5","Ceviche"],["Rous","3","Ceviche"]]
Output: [["Table","Beef Burrito","Ceviche","Fried Chicken","Water"],["3","0","2","1","0"],["5","0","1","0","1"],["10","1","0","0","0"]] 
Explanation:
The displaying table looks like:
Table,Beef Burrito,Ceviche,Fried Chicken,Water
3    ,0           ,2      ,1            ,0
5    ,0           ,1      ,0            ,1
10   ,1           ,0      ,0            ,0
For the table 3: David orders "Ceviche" and "Fried Chicken", and Rous orders "Ceviche".

For the table 5: Carla orders "Water" and "Ceviche".

For the table 10: Corina orders "Beef Burrito". 

Example 2:
Input: orders = [["James","12","Fried Chicken"],["Ratesh","12","Fried Chicken"],["Amadeus","12","Fried Chicken"],["Adam","1","Canadian Waffles"],["Brianna","1","Canadian Waffles"]]
Output: [["Table","Canadian Waffles","Fried Chicken"],["1","2","0"],["12","0","3"]] 
Explanation: 
For the table 1: Adam and Brianna order "Canadian Waffles".

For the table 12: James, Ratesh and Amadeus order "Fried Chicken".


Example 3:
Input: orders = [["Laura","2","Bean Burrito"],["Jhon","2","Beef Burrito"],["Melissa","2","Soda"]]
Output: [["Table","Bean Burrito","Beef Burrito","Soda"],["2","1","1","1"]]

Constraints:
`1 <= orders.length <= 5 * 10^4`
`orders[i].length == 3`
`1 <= customerNamei.length, foodItemi.length <= 20`
`customerNamei` and `foodItemi` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.

`tableNumberi `is a valid integer between `1` and `500`.

### Solution 
 Here's a Python solution with detailed explanation that could be run directly on the LeetCode platform:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def displayTable(self, orders: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Dictionary to store the food items and their counts per table
        table_order = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        
        # Set to collect unique food items
        food_items = set()
        
        # Process each order in the list
        for customer, table, item in orders:
            # Convert table number to integer to manage sorting easily
            table_order[int(table)][item] += 1
            food_items.add(item)
        
        # Sort food items alphabetically
        sorted_food_items = sorted(food_items)
        
        # Prepare the header with "Table" and the sorted food item names
        header = ["Table"] + sorted_food_items
        result = [header]
        
        # Retrieve the table numbers in sorted order
        sorted_tables = sorted(table_order.keys())
        
        # Construct the result rows for each table
        for table in sorted_tables:
            # Start each row with the table number
            row = [str(table)]
            # Append the count of each food item, in the order of sorted_food_items
            for item in sorted_food_items:
                row.append(str(table_order[table][item]))
            result.append(row)

        return result

# Example Usage
sol = Solution()
orders = [["David","3","Ceviche"],["Corina","10","Beef Burrito"],["David","3","Fried Chicken"],["Carla","5","Water"],["Carla","5","Ceviche"],["Rous","3","Ceviche"]]
print(sol.displayTable(orders))

```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Structure Choices**:
   - I use a `defaultdict` of `defaultdict(int)` for `table_order` to track the count of each food item at each table.
   - A regular `set` is used to store unique food items from all orders.

2. **Processing Orders**:
   - Loop through each order and update the `table_order` dict with counts of each item for the given table and add the food item to the `food_items` set.
   - Table numbers are converted to integers to naturally handle numerical sorting later.

3. **Organizing & Sorting**:
   - Before constructing the final list, sort `food_items` alphabetically.
   - Generate a `header` with "Table" followed by sorted food item names.
   - Sort the tables numerically.

4. **Constructing Output**:
   - Initialize the result with the header.
   - Append counters for each food item per table to the result list after converting counts and table numbers to strings for display.

The function ensures efficiency even for the upper limit of constraints by using dictionaries for count calculations and avoiding excessive looping or redundant sorting. The inner structure and workings have been optimized while ensuring accuracy and adherence to the specified format.

# 1429. First Unique Number

### Problem Description 
You have a queue of integers, you need to retrieve the first unique integer in the queue.

Implement the `FirstUnique` class:
`FirstUnique(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the numbers in the queue.

`int showFirstUnique()` returns the value of the first unique integer of the queue, and returns -1 if there is no such integer.

`void add(int value)` insert value to the queue.


Example 1:
Input: 
["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique"]
[[[2,3,5]],[],[5],[],[2],[],[3],[]]
Output: 
[null,2,null,2,null,3,null,-1]
Explanation: 
FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([2,3,5]);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 2
firstUnique.add(5);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 2
firstUnique.add(2);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5,2]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 3
firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5,2,3]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1

Example 2:
Input: 
["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","add","add","add","add","showFirstUnique"]
[[[7,7,7,7,7,7]],[],[7],[3],[3],[7],[17],[]]
Output: 
[null,-1,null,null,null,null,null,17]
Explanation: 
FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([7,7,7,7,7,7]);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
firstUnique.add(7);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3]
firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3]
firstUnique.add(7);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7]
firstUnique.add(17);           // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7,17]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 17

Example 3:
Input: 
["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique"]
[[[809]],[],[809],[]]
Output: 
[null,809,null,-1]
Explanation: 
FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([809]);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 809
firstUnique.add(809);          // the queue is now [809,809]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8`
`1 <= value <= 10^8`
At most `50000` calls will be made to `showFirstUnique` and `add`.

### Solution 
 The problem asks for a class `FirstUnique` that can initialize a queue with unique values (if any) and provide the first unique integer from the queue when queried. To efficiently maintain and update unique elements, the class should also have a method to add new values to the queue. Let's break down the problem into manageable components and address each one with an appropriate data structure.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the frequency of each integer.
   - Use an ordered data structure `queue` to store elements in the sequence they appear and ensure only unique integers (integers which have appeared exactly once) are stored for quick retrieval.

2. **Retrieve the First Unique Integer** (`showFirstUnique`):
   - Efficiently check and return the front element of the `queue` if it's unique.
   - If no unique element exists, return -1.

3. **Addition of Elements** (`add`):
   - Update the frequency of the added value in `counts`.
   - Adjust the `queue` to ensure it reflects the current state of unique values.

Focus will be on ensuring that both `showFirstUnique` and `add` operations are efficient.

### Implementation:



```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class FirstUnique:

    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.counts = defaultdict(int)  # Stores the count of appearances for each number
        self.queue = deque()            # Stores the unique numbers in order of appearance
        
        # Initialize by adding given numbers
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)

    def showFirstUnique(self) -> int:
        # Return the first element which is unique in the queue
        while self.queue and self.counts[self.queue[0]] > 1:
            self.queue.popleft()  # Remove elements from the queue that are no longer unique
        if self.queue:
            return self.queue[0]
        return -1

    def add(self, value: int) -> None:
        # Increment the count of the value
        self.counts[value] += 1
        # If it's the first occurrence, add it to the queue
        if self.counts[value] == 1:
            self.queue.append(value)
        # If it was unique but now added again making it no longer unique, we handle in showFirstUnique

# Example use
# firstUnique = FirstUnique([2, 3, 5])
# firstUnique.showFirstUnique()  # return 2
# firstUnique.add(5)             # the queue is now [2,3,5,5]
# firstUnique.showFirstUnique()  # return 2

```

### Efficiency:
- `__init__` initializes the structures with all the initial numbers, working in O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- `showFirstUnique` operates in amortized O(1) time since each element can only be enqueued and dequeued at most once.
- `add` works in O(1) due to dictionary and deque operations being constant time on average.

This solution adheres to LeetCode's format, ready to be tested directly on their platform. It effectively handles frequent checks for the first unique element and addition of new elements even for large input sizes.

# 1485. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer

### Problem Description 
A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a deep copy of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`. `NodeCopy` class is just a clone of `Node` class with the same attributes and constructors.


Example 1:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Explanation: The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].

The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].

The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.


Example 2:
Input: root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Explanation: The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

Example 4:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 5:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[0, 1000].`
Each node's value is between `[1, 10^6]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of deep copying a tree where each node has a random pointer, you can use a hashmap (dictionary) to store relationships between original nodes and their copies. You need to ensure the node's left, right, and random pointers are correctly set. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **DFS Strategy:** Use a depth-first search approach where you recursively create copies of nodes. 
2. **Hashmap Storage:** Use a hashmap to store the relationship between the original nodes and their deep copied versions. This way, you can efficiently set the random pointers of the copied nodes by accessing the hashmap.
3. **Recursive Copying:** Recursively copy left and right children of the node. If the original node has a random pointer, use the hashmap to reference its corresponding copy.
4. **Handling Edge Cases:** If the input tree is empty (`root` is `None`), simply return `None`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:



```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, random=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.random = random

class NodeCopy:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, random=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.random = random

class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        # Map original nodes to their copies
        self.visited = {}
        
    def copyRandomBinaryTree(self, root: 'Node') -> 'NodeCopy':
        if root is None:
            return None
        
        # If we have already processed this node then we just return it
        if root in self.visited:
            return self.visited[root]
        
        # Create a new node for the copied tree
        node_copy = NodeCopy(root.val)
        self.visited[root] = node_copy
        
        # Copy the left and right subtrees
        node_copy.left = self.copyRandomBinaryTree(root.left)
        node_copy.right = self.copyRandomBinaryTree(root.right)
        
        # Copy the random pointer
        if root.random:
            node_copy.random = self.copyRandomBinaryTree(root.random)
        
        return node_copy

# This code defines a `Solution` class which implements the method `copyRandomBinaryTree` to clone the unique binary tree structure.

```

Be sure to implement the `Node` and `NodeCopy` classes correctly in the LeetCode environment, as they might not be predefined. The `Solution` class and the copy function are structured to work in such environments by maintaining persistent state across recursive calls via `self.visited`. This setup ensures our deep copy correctly copies all pointers: left, right, and random.

# 1487. Making File Names Unique

### Problem Description 
Given an array of strings `names` of size `n`. You will create `n` folders in your file system such that, at the `ith` minute, you will create a folder with the name `names[i]`.

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of `(k)`, where, `k` is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the actual name the system will assign to the `ith` folder when you create it.


Example 1:
Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"

Example 2:
Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"

Example 3:
Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".


Example 4:
Input: names = ["wano","wano","wano","wano"]
Output: ["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]
Explanation: Just increase the value of k each time you create folder "wano".


Example 5:
Input: names = ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]
Output: ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]
Explanation: Please note that system adds the suffix (k) to current name even it contained the same suffix before.


Constraints:
`1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10^4`
`1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
`names[i]` consists of lower case English letters, digits and/or round brackets.

### Solution 
 

```python
class Solution:
    def getFolderNames(self, names: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Create a dictionary to hold the names and the next suffix number to append
        name_count = {}
        # The result list for final folder names
        result = []
        
        # Process each name one by one as they're created minute by minute
        for name in names:
            if name not in name_count:
                # If the name hasn't been used, add it directly
                result.append(name)
                name_count[name] = 1  # Start checking from suffix (1) next time this root appears
            else:
                # If the name has been used, calculate the next unique name
                k = name_count[name]
                new_name = f"{name}({k})"
                while new_name in name_count:
                    # Increment k until a unique name is found
                    k += 1
                    new_name = f"{name}({k})"
                
                # Add the newly found unique name
                result.append(new_name)
                # Update counts for the new unique name and increment the suffix start for original name
                name_count[new_name] = 1
                name_count[name] = k + 1
        
        return result

# Let's make few tests as per LeetCode format
def run_tests():
    sol = Solution()
    # Test cases
    assert sol.getFolderNames(["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]) == ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
    assert sol.getFolderNames(["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]) == ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
    assert sol.getFolderNames(["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]) == ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
    assert sol.getFolderNames(["wano","wano","wano","wano"]) == ["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]
    assert sol.getFolderNames(["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]) == ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]

# Execute the tests
run_tests()

```

Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a dictionary `name_count` to track original names and the subsequent integer needed to create a unique name (starting with 1). The `result` list will store our resulting folder names.
  
2. **Processing Each Name**:
   - If the name hasn't been used before (it's not in `name_count`), simply append it to the result and update `name_count` to start appending `(1)` next time this name appears.
   - If the name has been used, we generate new names by appending `(k)`, where `k` is the smallest integer ensuring the name is unique. We start from the previously tracked value in `name_count`.

3. **Managing Duplicates**:
   - When encountering a duplicate name, we look for the smallest `k` that creates a unique name by continuously checking if the modified name exists in `name_count` and incrementing `k` until a unique name is found.
   - After finding a unique name `new_name`, update `name_count` with this new name and set its value to 1. Also, update the `name_count` of the original name to start from the next integer for future names.

This approach, while straightforward in managing the creation of unique folder names, ensures that names are processed efficiently using hashing (dictionary operations). Each name undergoes a check that is largely dependent on the number of collisions but is efficient due to the structured storage in a dictionary.

# 1488. Avoid Flood in The City

### Problem Description 
Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the `nth` lake, the `nth` lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array `rains` where:
`rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.

`rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array `ans` where:
`ans.length == rains.length`
`ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.

`ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the `ith` day if `rains[i] == 0`.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)

Example 1:
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.


Example 2:
Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.

After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].

After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].

It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.


Example 3:
Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.

After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.


Example 4:
Input: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]
Output: [-1,69,1,1,-1]
Explanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9

Example 5:
Input: rains = [10,20,20]
Output: []
Explanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.


Constraints:
`1 <= rains.length <= 105`
`0 <= rains[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 Here's the Python code for the described problem along with comments explaining each part. This solution utilizes the trade-off between space and time complexity for the sake of clarity and efficiency in a real contest scenario like LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def avoidFlood(self, rains: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        from sortedcontainers import SortedList
        
        lake_to_day = {}
        dry_days = SortedList()
        result = [-1] * len(rains)
        
        for day, lake in enumerate(rains):
            if lake > 0:
                if lake in lake_to_day:
                    # We need a dry day before the current day to avoid flood
                    if not dry_days:
                        return []
                    # Find the closest dry day before the current rain day
                    index = dry_days.bisect_left(lake_to_day[lake] + 1)
                    if index == len(dry_days):
                        return []
                    # Use the found dry day to dry the lake
                    result[dry_days[index]] = lake
                    dry_days.pop(index)
                
                # Mark current lake as full and store the day
                lake_to_day[lake] = day
            else:
                # Collect days with no rain
                dry_days.add(day)
                result[day] = 1  # This will be overwritten if used correctly
        
        # If there are any unused dry days, we can set the result arbitrarily
        # Typically we set to dry any lake, let's say 1
        for i in range(len(result)):
            if rains[i] == 0 and result[i] == 1:
                result[i] = 1
                
        return result

```

### Explanation

**Step-by-Step Logic:**

1. **Tracking Lakes and Dry Days**: Use `lake_to_day` dictionary to keep track of the last day each lake got filled and `dry_days` (using `SortedList` from `sortedcontainers` for efficient insertion, deletion, and search) to record the days with no rain (i.e., possible days for drying lakes).

2. **Processing Each Day**:
    - If a lake receives rain (`lake > 0`):
        - If it has rained on that lake previously and hasn't been dried after the last rain, check the dry_days list to see if there's any available day to dry the lake before the next rain.
        - If appropriate dry day is found (`index` in dry_days which is greater than the day the lake was last full), use it to dry the lake (i.e., set `result[dry_days[index]]` to the lake number). Then remove that day from `dry_days` indicating it's used.
        - If no such dry day exists, return `[]` (impossible to avoid flood).
    - If no rain on that day (`lake == 0`):
        - Simply record the day in `dry_days` and set a placeholder (`result[day] = 1`) to be overwritten when actually used.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
    - After processing all days, ensure any dry day that was never utilized is set to dry an arbitrary lake (e.g., lake 1) as allowed by the problem description.

This solution ensures correctness while achieving efficiency by combining hash table lookups and the sorted list operations, all within acceptable time complexity bounds for typical competitive programming constraints.

# 1490. Clone N-ary Tree

### Problem Description 
Given a `root` of an N-ary tree, return a deep copy (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its children.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Follow up: Can your solution work for the graph problem?

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Constraints:
The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of cloning an N-ary tree, we will be creating an exact copy of the given tree node by node using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. For this problem, we need a function that takes the root of the N-ary tree and returns a new root that represents the cloned tree.

In Python, we can define the tree structure using a `Node` class with two attributes: `val` for the node's value, and `children` for storing its children.

To implement the cloning function:
1. If the root node is `None`, return `None` immediately - this is our base case.
2. For each node encountered, create a new node with the same value.
3. Recursively clone all children of the current node and assign them to the children of the newly created node.
4. Return the new root of the cloned tree.

It is important to monitor already visited nodes to manage cases where the tree might have cycles (making it a graph rather than a strict tree). This can be accomplished using a dictionary to map original nodes to their corresponding cloned nodes.

Below is the Python code following the described approach:



```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children if children is not None else []
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneTree(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return None

        # Dictionary to keep track of already copied nodes in case of graphs
        copied_nodes = {}

        def clone(node):
            if node in copied_nodes:
                return copied_nodes[node]

            # Create a copy of the current node
            copy_node = Node(node.val)
            copied_nodes[node] = copy_node

            # Recursive case: clone all children and add to the copied node's child list
            for child in node.children:
                copy_node.children.append(clone(child))

            return copy_node

        return clone(root)

# The code can now be used to clone any N-ary tree or even cyclical graph structured similarly.

```

This solution uses a helper function `clone` which performs the actual cloning of nodes. If the nodes weren't visited before, it creates new nodes and recursively clones its children. The `copied_nodes` map ensures that if the node structure presented cycles or duplications in child references, these would be handled correctly, making this solution applicable even in more complex scenarios such as graph cloning where nodes might be referenced multiple times.

Generally, you can use this code directly in LeetCode to test against N-ary tree clone problems. This approach effectively addresses the given problem constraints and can be extended for broader use cases, like duplicating structures with back references.

# 1512. Number of Good Pairs

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `nums`.

A pair `(i,j)` is called good if `nums[i]` == `nums[j]` and `i` < `j`.

Return the number of good pairs.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 100`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can utilize a hashmap (or dictionary in Python) to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the `nums` list. As we iterate through `nums`, we can use the hashmap to determine how many times each number has appeared previously. This count directly indicates the number of new good pairs that can be formed with the current element since each previous occurrence can pair with the current element to form a good pair.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Create a dictionary called `count` to keep track of occurrences of each number.
2. Initialize a variable `ans` at 0 to store the count of good pairs.
3. Loop through each number in `nums`. For each number:
   - Check how many times this number has appeared before (using the dictionary).
   - Increment `ans` by this count since each previous occurrence forms a good pair with the current number.
   - Update the number's frequency in `count`.
4. After finishing the loop, `ans` will contain the total number of good pairs.

This approach leverages the fact that each occurrence of a number can be paired up with all its previous occurrences, which simplifies the computation to a linear pass through the input list, resulting in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of `nums`.

Here’s the Python code for this approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def numIdenticalPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        ans = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num in count:
                ans += count[num]
                count[num] += 1
            else:
                count[num] = 1
                
        return ans

```

We use an instance method `numIdenticalPairs()` to calculate the answer. It ensures compatibility with the typical LeetCode format where they provide a class `Solution` with a method that needs to be implemented. You can copy and paste this directly into LeetCode's online editor to run tests or submit it. Make sure to test it with different inputs to verify its correctness.

Example tests:
- For the input `[1,2,3,1,1,3]`, it should output `4`.
- For the input `[1,1,1,1]`, it should output `6`.
- For the input `[1,2,3]`, it should output `0`.
All these match the expected results based on the problem's description.

# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

### Problem Description 
Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`.

Find the `kth` positive integer that is missing from this array.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
`1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
`1 <= k <= 1000`
`arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

### Solution 
 Here's a Python solution that directly addresses the problem using the specified format and guidelines ready to be uploaded to LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Start with the first positive number and the index for the array
        current, i = 1, 0
        
        # Keep track of how many numbers are missing
        missing_count = 0
        
        while missing_count < k:
            # If current is not in the array, it is missing
            if i < len(arr) and arr[i] == current:
                # Move to the next element in the array if the current is found
                i += 1
            else:
                # Increase the missing count if the current number is not in the array
                missing_count += 1
                if missing_count == k:
                    return current  # Found the kth missing number
            
            # Always increment the current number to check
            current += 1
        
        # Fallback, should never be hit due to while condition
        return current

# Here is how to use the class Solution:
# sol = Solution()
# result = sol.findKthPositive([2,3,4,7,11], 5)
# print(result)  # Outputs 9

# result = sol.findKthPositive([1,2,3,4], 2)
# print(result)  # Outputs 6

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start with the smallest positive integer (`current = 1`) and set up a pointer `i` for indexing `arr`.

2. **Traversal and Check**: We use a while loop that runs until we track `k` missing numbers.
   - **If present in `arr`**: Check if the current number is at the current index `i` of `arr`. If yes, move the index `i` forward as this number isn't missing.
   - **If missing**: (i.e., the number is not at the current index `i`), increment the `missing_count`. If `missing_count` equals `k`, return the current number as it is the `k`-th missing integer.
   - Post checks, increment `current` to proceed to the next potential missing number.

3. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient with O(n) complexity, where `n` is the number of terms in `arr` you need to scan through to find all `k` missing integers, considering no array values are skipped due to the loop's structure.

# 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors

### Problem Description 
Given two sparse vectors, compute their dot product.

Implement class `SparseVector`:
`SparseVector(nums)` Initializes the object with the vector `nums`
`dotProduct(vec)` Compute the dot product between the instance of SparseVector and `vec`
A sparse vector is a vector that has mostly zero values, you should store the sparse vector efficiently and compute the dot product between two SparseVector.

Follow up: What if only one of the vectors is sparse?

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,0,0,2,3], nums2 = [0,3,0,4,0]
Output: 8
Explanation: v1 = SparseVector(nums1) , v2 = SparseVector(nums2)
v1.dotProduct(v2) = 1*0 + 0*3 + 0*0 + 2*4 + 3*0 = 8

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [0,1,0,0,0], nums2 = [0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: v1 = SparseVector(nums1) , v2 = SparseVector(nums2)
v1.dotProduct(v2) = 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*2 = 0

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0,1,0,0,2,0,0], nums2 = [1,0,0,0,3,0,4]
Output: 6

Constraints:
`n == nums1.length == nums2.length`
`1 <= n <= 10^5`
`0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of computing the dot product of two sparse vectors efficiently while also conserving memory, we can take advantage of the sparsity of the vectors. Given that sparse vectors mostly contain zeros, we can store only the non-zero elements. We represent each sparse vector as a dictionary where the key is the index and the value is the nonzero value at that index.

Here is a Python implementation using the described approach:



```python
class SparseVector:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        # Use dictionary to save only nonzero elements
        self.positions = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num != 0:
                self.positions[i] = num

    def dotProduct(self, vec: 'SparseVector') -> int:
        """
        Return the dot product of two sparse vectors.
        """
        # Result variable to store the sum of products
        result = 0
        # Iterate through the smaller dictionary to save computational costs
        if len(self.positions) < len(vec.positions):
            for idx, val in self.positions.items():
                if idx in vec.positions:
                    result += val * vec.positions[idx]
        else:
            for idx, val in vec.positions.items():
                if idx in self.positions:
                    result += val * self.positions[idx]

        return result

# Your SparseVector object will be instantiated and called as such:
# v1 = SparseVector(nums1)
# v2 = SparseVector(nums2)
# ans = v1.dotProduct(v2)

```

### Explanation:
1. **SparseVector Initialization**
    - Instead of storing the entire vector, we initialize a dictionary `self.positions` where each key is an index and each value is the corresponding non-zero value of the vector.
    - This is efficient because the memory usage depends only on the number of non-zero entries.

2. **Dot Product Calculation**
    - To calculate the dot product, we iterate through the nonzero elements of the smaller sparse vector (for efficiency).
    - For each non-zero element, if the other vector also has a non-zero value at that index, we compute the product and add it to our result.

### Follow-up Consideration:
- **If only one vector is sparse:** If only one vector is sparse, the strategy would still work efficiently. You would iterate through the non-zero elements of the sparse vector and access the corresponding values from the non-sparse vector directly using index access. It remains time-optimal as it skips computing products with zero, which would be the case for the zero entries in a sparse vector.

This code efficiently handles the sparsity and ensures that only necessary computations are done without traversing through entire vectors unnecessarily, which could be costly especially when vectors are of size up to \(10^5\).

# 1590. Make Sum Divisible by P

### Problem Description 
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is not allowed to remove the whole array.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or `-1` if it's impossible.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.


Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 7
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to remove a subarray in order to get a sum divisible by 7.


Example 5:
Input: nums = [1000000000,1000000000,1000000000], p = 3
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
`1 <= p <= 109`

### Solution 
 Here's the Python solution for the problem statement along with a detailed explanation. The solution utilizes a prefix sum array along with a hash map to efficiently check the sum conditions for divisibility. This approach adheres to the specifications so it can be run directly on LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def minSubarray(self, nums: List[int], p: int) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target_remainder = total_sum % p
        
        # If the total is already divisible by p, we do not need to remove anything
        if target_remainder == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Dictionary to hold the earliest occurrence of each prefix sum modulus
        prefix_mod_dict = {0: -1}
        min_length = float('inf')
        prefix_sum = 0
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            prefix_sum += num
            current_remainder = prefix_sum % p
            
            # Calculate the necessary remainder to find in the prefix_sum array
            needed_remainder = (current_remainder - target_remainder + p) % p
            
            # Check if this remainder has been seen before
            if needed_remainder in prefix_mod_dict:
                min_length = min(min_length, i - prefix_mod_dict[needed_remainder])
            
            # Record the current_remainder's smallest index
            prefix_mod_dict[current_remainder] = i
        
        # If the minimal length subarray found is not smaller than the array length,
        # it means there is no valid subarray to be removed
        if min_length == float('inf') or min_length == len(nums):
            return -1
        return min_length

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Computations**:
    - Calculate the total sum of the array `nums`.
    - Calculate the remainder when divided by `p` (as `target_remainder`).

2. **Early Exit**:
    - If `target_remainder` is `0`, the total sum is already divisible by `p`, so we immediately return `0` since no subarray needs to be removed.

3. **Prefix Sum and HashMap**:
    - Use a `prefix_sum` and a hashmap (`prefix_mod_dict`) which records the first occurrence of a remainder when `prefix_sum` is divided by `p`.
    - Loop through the array updating `prefix_sum` at each step and compute its remainder `current_remainder` with `p`.

4. **Check Conditions**:
   - The `needed_remainder` is calculated, which serves to "cancel out" the `target_remainder` if such a remainder can be found from earlier prefix sums.
   - If `needed_remainder` has appeared previously in the prefix sums as recorded in `prefix_mod_dict`, compare and possibly update `min_length` with the distance (subarray size) between current index `i` and the index stored in `prefix_mod_dict`.

5. **Result**:
    - After processing the array, check the value of `min_length`. If it's the size of the array or was never updated (`float('inf')`), return `-1` to indicate that no valid subarray could be found that would adjust the whole array's sum to be divisible by `p`.
    - Otherwise, return `min_length`.

# 1612. Check If Two Expression Trees are Equivalent

### Problem Description 
A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators. In this problem, we only consider the `'+'` operator (i.e. addition).

You are given the roots of two binary expression trees, `root1` and `root2`. Return `true` if the two binary expression trees are equivalent. Otherwise, return `false`.

Two binary expression trees are equivalent if they evaluate to the same value regardless of what the variables are set to.

Follow up: What will you change in your solution if the tree also supports the `'-'` operator (i.e. subtraction)?

Example 1:
Input: root1 = [x], root2 = [x]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,a,b,c]
Output: true
Explaination: `a + (b + c) == (b + c) + a`

Example 3:
Input: root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,a,b,d]
Output: false
Explaination: `a + (b + c) != (b + d) + a`

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both trees are equal, odd and, in the range `[1, 4999]`.

`Node.val` is `'+'` or a lower-case English letter.

It's guaranteed that the tree given is a valid binary expression tree.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can evaluate each binary expression tree to find its canonical form. Specifically, since we only deal with the '+' operator which is commutative (i.e., \(a + b = b + a\)), the order of addition does not affect the result.

We can perform a traversal of the tree (such as inorder) that collects all leaf nodes (operands), since the arrangement of the '+' operator nodes will not impact the final result when dealing with commutative operations. By collecting all operands in a multiset (or a frequency map in Python terms) for both trees and comparing these sets, we can determine if the trees are equivalent.

Here is the Python code implementing this logic:



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def checkEquivalence(self, root1: Node, root2: Node) -> bool:
        # Helper function to gather all variables from the expression tree.
        def gather_vars(node):
            if node is None:
                return
            if node.val != '+':  # it's a variable
                freq[node.val] += 1
            else:
                gather_vars(node.left)
                gather_vars(node.right)
        
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Gather variables from root1
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        gather_vars(root1)
        variables_root1 = dict(freq)
        
        # Gather variables from root2
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        gather_vars(root2)
        variables_root2 = dict(freq)
        
        # Check if the variable counts are the same for both trees
        return variables_root1 == variables_root2

# Example usage:
# Construct the Node structure as you see necessary for input.
# Let's construct trees rooted at root1 and root2 and test if they are equivalent.
# Example tree representations:
# root1 = [+, a, +, null, null, b, c] might be implemented with specific instantiation of Nodes class.

```

### Follow-up: Introducing the '-' Operator

The introduction of the '-' (subtraction) operator complicates the problem because subtraction is not commutative, i.e., \(a - b 
eq b - a\). Thus, simply counting occurrences of variables does not suffice.

A correct approach will likely need to evaluate expressions character-by-character and account for order and operation ('+' vs '-'). This might entail parsing the expression more completely or using tree isomorphism checking methods that respect both structure and node values.

An approach might include using annotations or tagging during tree traversal to account for the path taken (like "left" or "right" child leading to different effects for subtraction), ensuring the structure and computations accurately reflect the structure led by operators. Alternatively, symbolic representation and simplification using libraries like `sympy` can handle such cases but would exceed the typical exercise spectrum for such interview-prep problems.

# 1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character

### Problem Description 
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of `s` and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of `t`. In other words, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in `t` by exactly one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in `"computer"` and `"computation"` only differ by the `'e'`/`'a'`, so this is a valid way.

Return the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aba", t = "baba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.


​​Example 2:
Input: s = "ab", t = "bb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
​​​​The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.


Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: 0

Example 4:
Input: s = "abe", t = "bbc"
Output: 10

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100`
`s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.

### Solution 
 Given the problem, we need to determine all the non-empty substrings of `s` that can be changed by one character to match any substring of `t`. For each character substitution from `s`, it should exactly match the substring of `t`.

### Solution Strategy:

1. **Brute Force Method**: Iterate over every possible substring in `s` and for each substring, iterate over every possible substring in `t` to check if they can be made identical by changing just one character in the substring of `s`.

2. **Efficiency**: To achieve this efficiently,
    - Iterate through each starting and ending index `i` and `j` for substrings of `s`.
    - For each substring in `s`, compare against every substring in `t` of the same length.
    - Compare the substrings character by character. If exactly one character in the substring from `s` differs from the corresponding substring in `t`, it is a valid substring.
    - Continue this for all possible lengths and starting indices.

3. **Edge-cases**:
    - Both `s` and `t` being the exact same string.
    - Non-overlapping character sets in `s` and `t`.

### Python Code:

I will now write a Python function that follows the strategy outlined above.



```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        def countOneDiff(s_sub, t_sub):
            diff_count = 0
            for x, y in zip(s_sub, t_sub):
                if x != y:
                    diff_count += 1
                    if diff_count > 1:
                        return 0
            return 1 if diff_count == 1 else 0
        
        count = 0
        len_s, len_t = len(s), len(t)
        
        # Brute-force over all substrings of s
        for i in range(len_s):
            for j in range(i + 1, len_s + 1):  # j is exclusive, i.e., substr(i, j)
                s_sub = s[i:j]
                s_sub_length = len(s_sub)
                
                # Check this substring with all substrings of t with the same length
                for k in range(len_t - s_sub_length + 1):
                    t_sub = t[k:k + s_sub_length]
                    # Count only if exactly one character is different
                    if countOneDiff(s_sub, t_sub) == 1:
                        count += 1
        
        return count

# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countSubstrings("aba", "baba"))  # Output: 6
print(solution.countSubstrings("ab", "bb"))     # Output: 3
print(solution.countSubstrings("a", "a"))       # Output: 0
print(solution.countSubstrings("abe", "bbc"))   # Output: 10

```

This code defines a function `countSubstrings` within a `Solution` class (as is typical format for LeetCode). This function computes the number of valid substrings of `s` that become a substring of `t` by changing exactly one character. We use a helper function `countOneDiff` to check if two substrings differ by exactly one character. 

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: For each window size from 1 to n, comparing `s_sub` with every possible `t_sub` is O(n^2 * m) where n is the length of s and m is the length of t.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space beyond the input strings.

# 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation

### Problem Description 
You are given an array of distinct integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are distinct. Your goal is to form `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` in any order. However, you are not allowed to reorder the integers in each array `pieces[i]`.

Return `true` if it is possible to form the array `arr` from `pieces`. Otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate `[15]` then `[88]`

Example 3:
Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
Output: false
Explanation: Even though the numbers match, we cannot reorder pieces[0].


Example 4:
Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate `[91]` then `[4,64]` then `[78]`

Example 5:
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], pieces = [[2,4,6,8]]
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= pieces.length <= arr.length <= 100`
`sum(pieces[i].length) == arr.length`
`1 <= pieces[i].length <= arr.length`
`1 <= arr[i], pieces[i][j] <= 100`
The integers in `arr` are distinct.

The integers in `pieces` are distinct (i.e., If we flatten pieces in a 1D array, all the integers in this array are distinct).

### Solution 
 The problem can be approached using a dictionary to map the starting integers of each sub-array in `pieces` to their respective sub-array. This mapping helps in quickly identifying and retrieving the correct sequence to match with the main array `arr`.

The process starts by constructing this mapping. With the dictionary in hand, the next step is to iterate through the main list `arr`. At each point, the code looks up the starting integer in the current position of `arr` within the dictionary to find the corresponding sub-array from `pieces`. If the sub-array starting position matches and the subsequent integers of `arr` coincide with those of the sub-array, the verification continues. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.

If the entire array `arr` is successfully verified against sub-arrays from `pieces`, the function returns `true`.

The LeetCode solution format for this approach ensures that each sub-array is correctly placed according to its sequence in `arr` and is implemented as follows:



```python
class Solution:
    def canFormArray(self, arr: List[int], pieces: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Create a dictionary to quickly find pieces by their starting element
        piece_dict = {p[0]: p for p in pieces}
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(arr):
            if arr[i] in piece_dict:
                # Get the piece that should follow from this point
                piece = piece_dict[arr[i]]
                # Check the entirety of the piece against arr
                for num in piece:
                    if i < len(arr) and arr[i] == num:
                        i += 1
                    else:
                        return False
            else:
                return False
        return True

```

With this solution:

1. We utilize a dictionary for fast access, mapping each first element of sub-arrays in `pieces` to the sub-array itself.
2. We iterate over `arr`, and at each step, look up the current integer in our dictionary. If it exists, we verify that the subsequent integers in `arr` match the sub-array from the dictionary.
3. If at any step there's a mismatch, or if a starting element isn't found in our dictionary, we return `false`.
4. Success through the entire main array without mismatches results in a return value of `true`.

This solution efficiently navigates through the array and pieces, leveraging hashing for quick lookup operations and ensuring that the elements in `pieces` appear in `arr` in the exact group order as required.

# 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
`1 <= k <= 109`

### Solution 
 To address this problem, you can use a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each number in the array. This allows efficient checking for if a complement that sums to `k` exists.

The basic idea is:
1. For each number `a` in the array, calculate its complement `b` such that `a + b = k`.
2. Check if `b` exists in the frequency dictionary.
3. If it exists and is different from `a`, then you can form a pair (if both frequencies are nonzero).
4. If `b` is the same as `a`, then you need at least two of `a` to form one operation.
5. Decrement the frequencies by 1 for each number part of an obtained pair to ensure numbers are only used once.

Here's how you'd implement this in Python following LeetCode's submission format.



```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        num_count = {}
        op_count = 0

        # Count the occurrences of each number in the nums array
        for num in nums:
            num_count[num] = num_count.get(num, 0) + 1

        # Attempt to find and count valid pairs
        for num in list(num_count.keys()):
            complement = k - num
            if complement in num_count:
                if num == complement:
                    # If num and complement are the same, we can only form num_count[num] // 2 pairs
                    op_count += num_count[num] // 2
                else:
                    # If num and complement are different
                    # Perform min(number of num, number of complement) operations
                    possible_pairs = min(num_count[num], num_count[complement])
                    op_count += possible_pairs
                    # Adjust counts so we do not reuse the numbers
                    num_count[num] = num_count[num] - possible_pairs
                    num_count[complement] = num_count[complement] - possible_pairs

        return op_count

```

This code maintains a balance between checking existence of pairs and updating frequencies correctly to ensure all operations are counted properly without reusing numbers. It's efficient because it uses dictionary lookups which are average O(1) operations, and iterates through the list and dictionary in O(n) and O(u) time (where u is the number of unique numbers).

# 1711. Count Good Meals

### Problem Description 
A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `i​​​​​​th​​​​`​​​​ item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo `109 + 7`.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.


Example 1:
Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).

Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.


Example 2:
Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.


Constraints:
`1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105`
`0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the number of good meals where the sum is a power of two, we can use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to efficiently counts pairs while iterating over the array of `deliciousness`.

**Key Steps and Strategy**:
1. **Powers of Two**: Identify the relevant powers of two up to \(2^{21}\), given that the maximum value in the array can go up to \(2^{20}\) and two such maximum values would sum up to \(2^{21}\).
2. **Hash Map for Counting**: As we walk through each item in the `deliciousness` array, we count instances using a hash map. This map helps in quickly looking up how many times a complement (i.e., \( \text{power of two} - \text{current item} \)) has occurred before.
3. **Count Pairs**: For each food item `food` in `deliciousness`, for each power of two, calculate the complement (which is `power of two - food`). Then, if this complement exists in our hash map, add the count of the complement from the map to our total pairs count, because it tells us how many previous foods can pair with the current `food` to form a good meal.
4. **Update Hash Map**: After checking each food item against all powers of two, update the map with the current food item to count it for future potential pairs.
5. **Avoid Double Counting**: Each pair is essentially counted twice, once per each item's perspective. We will account for this in our calculation correctly.
6. **Modulo Operation**: Given the constraints where output should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\), include the modulo operation in order to manage large numbers and prevent integer overflows.

Below is the Python solution in the format suitable for running directly on LeetCode.



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, deliciousness: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        power_of_twos = [1 << i for i in range(22)] # 2^0 to 2^21
        count = {}
        total_pairs = 0
        
        for food in deliciousness:
            for power in power_of_twos:
                complement = power - food
                if complement in count:
                    total_pairs = (total_pairs + count[complement]) % MOD
            
            if food in count:
                count[food] += 1
            else:
                count[food] = 1
        
        return total_pairs

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.countPairs([1,3,5,7,9]))  # Output: 4
# print(sol.countPairs([1,1,1,3,3,3,7]))  # Output: 15

```

This code correctly calculates the number of good meals according to the provided specifications, leveraging efficient data structures and ensuring accuracy with modulo operations where needed.

# 1726. Tuple with Same Product

### Problem Description 
Given an array `nums` of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements of `nums`, and `a != b != c != d`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,4,6]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 valid tuples:
(2,6,3,4) , (2,6,4,3) , (6,2,3,4) , (6,2,4,3)
(3,4,2,6) , (4,3,2,6) , (3,4,6,2) , (4,3,6,2)

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,4,5,10]
Output: 16
Explanation: There are 16 valids tuples:
(1,10,2,5) , (1,10,5,2) , (10,1,2,5) , (10,1,5,2)
(2,5,1,10) , (2,5,10,1) , (5,2,1,10) , (5,2,10,1)
(2,10,4,5) , (2,10,5,4) , (10,2,4,5) , (10,2,4,5)
(4,5,2,10) , (4,5,10,2) , (5,4,2,10) , (5,4,10,2)

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,3,4,6,8,12]
Output: 40

Example 4:
Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
All elements in `nums` are distinct.

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem, we can use an efficient strategy of computing and storing the product of every pair of elements from the given array `nums`, and then counting the number of ways this product can be achieved using different pairs.

**Approach:**
1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each product computed from pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums`.
2. Iterate through the array in a nested loop to compute the product for each pair (i, j) where i < j to ensure uniqueness and prevent counting the same pair twice.
3. For each pair's calculated product, increment its corresponding count in the dictionary.
4. After populating the dictionary, calculate the number of valid tuples:
   - If a product has `count` pairs, the total number of unique tuples for that product is given by the combination of taking two such pairs, since the problem statement allows swapping within the pairs in both positions.
   - For `count` pairs, the number of ways to select any two pairs is counted as \(\binom{count}{2} \times 8\). This accounts for \(\binom{count}{2}\) ways to pick two pairs from `count` and then multiply by 8 to account for the internal swaps (since (a, b) can be permuted to (b, a) in both tuple positions).
5. Aggregate the counts for all products to get the final result.

Here is the Python code representing the solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        import math
        product_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Calculate the counts of products
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                product = nums[i] * nums[j]
                product_count[product] += 1
        
        # Count the produced tuples
        result = 0
        for count in product_count.values():
            if count > 1:
                # We can pick any two pairs, (8 choices for every two pairs chosen)
                result += (math.comb(count, 2) * 8)
        
        return result

# The module, class and method structure align with a typical LeetCode Python submission.

```

This function would directly run on LeetCode given the list of positive integers as the input for `nums`. The explanation and the approach ensure that the structure holds in a real coding environment with a test suite like LeetCode's.

# 1748. Sum of Unique Elements

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums`. The unique elements of an array are the elements that appear exactly once in the array.

Return the sum of all the unique elements of `nums`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,3], and the sum is 4.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no unique elements, and the sum is 0.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,2,3,4,5], and the sum is 15.


Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 100`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution 
 

```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each number
        frequency = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num in frequency:
                frequency[num] += 1
            else:
                frequency[num] = 1
        
        # Step 2: Compute the sum of numbers that have a frequency of 1
        sum_of_unique = 0
        for num, count in frequency.items():
            if count == 1:
                sum_of_unique += num
        
        return sum_of_unique

# This class `Solution` can be directly run on LeetCode by passing the problem's test cases.

```

### Explanation

1. **File imports**: Since the code is intended to be run in a standard LeetCode solution format, it uses `List` from `typing`. If you're running outside LeetCode, add `from typing import List`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `sumOfUnique` takes an integer list `nums` as input and returns an integer output. `nums` represents the list of numbers from which we need to calculate the sum of unique elements.

3. **Logic**:
   - **Build Frequency Dictionary**: First, I build a dictionary `frequency` that maps each number to the count of occurrences in the list. I iterate through numbers in `nums` and for every number, I update its count in the dictionary.
   - **Sum Computation**: I then initialize `sum_of_unique` to zero. I then go through each item in the dictionary: if the count of a number is exactly one (indicating that it is unique), I add the number to `sum_of_unique`.

4. **Return**: Finally, the function returns `sum_of_unique` which is the sum of all unique numbers.

This function properly accounts for the constraints given (lengths and value sizes). The use of dictionary for frequency counting ensures that the function can handle the upper limits efficiently.


# 1772. Sort Features by Popularity

### Problem Description 
You are given a string array `features` where `features[i]` is a single word that represents the name of a feature of the latest product you are working on. You have made a survey where users have reported which features they like. You are given a string array `responses`, where each `responses[i]` is a string containing space-separated words.

The popularity of a feature is the number of `responses[i]` that contain the feature. You want to sort the features in non-increasing order by their popularity. If two features have the same popularity, order them by their original index in `features`. Notice that one response could contain the same feature multiple times; this feature is only counted once in its popularity.

Return the features in sorted order.


Example 1:
Input: features = ["cooler","lock","touch"], responses = ["i like cooler cooler","lock touch cool","locker like touch"]
Output: ["touch","cooler","lock"]
Explanation: appearances("cooler") = 1, appearances("lock") = 1, appearances("touch") = 2. Since "cooler" and "lock" both had 1 appearance, "cooler" comes first because "cooler" came first in the features array.


Example 2:
Input: features = ["a","aa","b","c"], responses = ["a","a aa","a a a a a","b a"]
Output: ["a","aa","b","c"]

Constraints:
`1 <= features.length <= 104`
`1 <= features[i].length <= 10`
`features` contains no duplicates.

`features[i]` consists of lowercase letters.

`1 <= responses.length <= 102`
`1 <= responses[i].length <= 103`
`responses[i]` consists of lowercase letters and spaces.

`responses[i]` contains no two consecutive spaces.

`responses[i]` has no leading or trailing spaces.

### Solution 
 You can solve this problem by following these steps:

1. Create a frequency dictionary (`feature_count`) to count the number of responses containing each feature.
2. For each response:
   - Convert the response to a set so that each word is unique. This eliminates multiple mentions of the same feature within the same response.
   - Check each feature against this set to see if it appears in the response.
   - Increase the popularity count in the `feature_count` dictionary for every appearance of the feature in the response.
3. Sort the features based on their popularity recorded in `feature_count`, and use their original index as a tie-breaker if two features have the same popularity.

By following this approach, you ensure that you efficiently count the appearance of each feature across all responses and can then output the features sorted non-increasingly by popularity, with the original order as tie-breaking criteria.

Here's how you can write the corresponding Python code:



```python
class Solution:
    def sortFeatures(self, features: List[str], responses: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Create a dictionary to count the appearances of each feature
        feature_count = {feature: 0 for feature in features}
        feature_index = {feature: i for i, feature in enumerate(features)}

        # Count how many responses mention each feature
        # We use a set for each response to prevent counting the same feature multiple times
        for response in responses:
            seen = set(response.split())
            for feature in features:
                if feature in seen:
                    feature_count[feature] += 1
        
        # Sort the features based on the number of appearances, and use the original index as a tiebreaker
        # By default sorting is in ascending order, hence we use negative count to simulate descending order
        sorted_features = sorted(features, key=lambda x: (-feature_count[x], feature_index[x]))
        
        return sorted_features

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.sortFeatures(["cooler","lock","touch"], ["i like cooler cooler","lock touch cool","locker like touch"])) # Output: ["touch","cooler","lock"]
print(sol.sortFeatures(["a","aa","b","c"], ["a","a aa","a a a a a","b a"])) # Output: ["a","aa","b","c"]

```

This code provides an efficient way to count feature appearances and sort features according to the problem's constraints and requirements. The use of dictionaries and sorting with custom lambda functions ensures clarity and efficiency.

# 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings

### Problem Description 
The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

For example, the beauty of `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Given a string `s`, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aabcb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.


Example 2:
Input: s = "aabcbaa"
Output: 17

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 500`
`s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 
 To tackle the problem of calculating the beauty of all substrings in a string `s` efficiently, we need to keep in mind the nature of substring computations which can potentially turn expensive given the constraints. The beauty for a substring is defined by the frequency difference between the most and least frequent characters.

Here’s a concise step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

1. **Understand the Direct Computation Complexity**:
   - Naively, iterating over all substrings and then computing the frequency of each character within these substrings would be too inefficient. The number of substrings of a string of length `n` is `n(n+1)/2`. Each substring’s character frequency computation in the worst case could again take `O(n)`. Hence, this direct approach is not feasible for `n` up to `500`.

2. **Optimized Approach Using Frequency Count**:
   - A more feasible approach involves iterating through each possible starting point of substrings, compute frequencies of characters on-the-fly as we extend the substring, and use this to compute the beauty without recomputing the entire frequency distribution from scratch for each substring.
   - Use a frequency dictionary to keep track of character counts as you expand the substring. This way, you don't have to recount all characters every time but just update counts as the substring grows.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each character in the string as a starting point, expand the substring character by character.
   - Continuously update the frequency count of the characters.
   - Calculate the beauty for each extended substring and add it to the total sum.

Given below is the Python code following the approach described:



```python
class Solution:
    def beautySum(self, s: str) -> int:
        beauty_sum = 0
        n = len(s)
        
        # Start from each index of the string
        for start in range(n):
            freq = {}
            for end in range(start, n):
                char = s[end]
                if char in freq:
                    freq[char] += 1
                else:
                    freq[char] = 1
                
                if len(freq) > 1:
                    max_freq = max(freq.values())
                    min_freq = min(freq.values())
                    beauty_sum += max_freq - min_freq
        
        return beauty_sum

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.beautySum("aabcb"))  # Output: 5
print(sol.beautySum("aabcbaa"))  # Output: 17

```

In the future, optimizations can investigate more about using other data structures that might improve the access/update time for frequency counts or explore mathematical properties to skip some calculations. However, the provided solution offers a good balance by directly considering how substring beauty can be computed efficiently by iterating the string and using a dictionary for counts.

# 1797. Design Authentication Manager

### Problem Description 
There is an authentication system that works with authentication tokens. For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire `timeToLive` seconds after the `currentTime`. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire `timeToLive` seconds after the (potentially different) `currentTime`.

Implement the `AuthenticationManager` class:
`AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive)` constructs the `AuthenticationManager` and sets the `timeToLive`.

`generate(string tokenId, int currentTime)` generates a new token with the given `tokenId` at the given `currentTime` in seconds.

`renew(string tokenId, int currentTime)` renews the unexpired token with the given `tokenId` at the given `currentTime` in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given `tokenId`, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.

`countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime)` returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.

Note that if a token expires at time `t`, and another action happens on time `t` (`renew` or `countUnexpiredTokens`), the expiration takes place before the other actions.


Example 1:
Input
["AuthenticationManager", "`renew`", "generate", "`countUnexpiredTokens`", "generate", "`renew`", "`renew`", "`countUnexpiredTokens`"]
[[5], ["aaa", 1], ["aaa", 2], [6], ["bbb", 7], ["aaa", 8], ["bbb", 10], [15]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, null, null, 0]
Explanation
AuthenticationManager authenticationManager = new AuthenticationManager(5); // Constructs the AuthenticationManager with `timeToLive` = 5 seconds.

authenticationManager.`renew`("aaa", 1); // No token exists with tokenId "aaa" at time 1, so nothing happens.

authenticationManager.generate("aaa", 2); // Generates a new token with tokenId "aaa" at time 2.

authenticationManager.`countUnexpiredTokens`(6); // The token with tokenId "aaa" is the only unexpired one at time 6, so return 1.

authenticationManager.generate("bbb", 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId "bbb" at time 7.

authenticationManager.`renew`("aaa", 8); // The token with tokenId "aaa" expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the `renew` request is ignored, and nothing happens.

authenticationManager.`renew`("bbb", 10); // The token with tokenId "bbb" is unexpired at time 10, so the `renew` request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.

authenticationManager.`countUnexpiredTokens`(15); // The token with tokenId "bbb" expires at time 15, and the token with tokenId "aaa" expired at time 7, so currently no token is unexpired, so return 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= timeToLive <= 108`
`1 <= currentTime <= 108`
`1 <= tokenId.length <= 5`
`tokenId` consists only of lowercase letters.

All calls to `generate` will contain unique values of `tokenId`.

The values of `currentTime` across all the function calls will be strictly increasing.

At most `2000` calls will be made to all functions combined.

### Solution 
 Here's the Python code implementing the `AuthenticationManager` class as described in the problem statement. This code should fit the expectations from the problem on LeetCode and constraints are respected in terms of method functionality and input constraints. 



```python
class AuthenticationManager:
    
    def __init__(self, timeToLive: int):
        self.timeToLive = timeToLive
        self.tokens = {}  # Stores tokens with their expiration times.

    def generate(self, tokenId: str, currentTime: int) -> None:
        self.tokens[tokenId] = currentTime + self.timeToLive  # Set expiration time of generated token.

    def renew(self, tokenId: str, currentTime: int) -> None:
        if tokenId in self.tokens and self.tokens[tokenId] > currentTime:
            # Renew the token only if it's still valid, i.e., hasn't expired.
            self.tokens[tokenId] = currentTime + self.timeToLive
            
    def countUnexpiredTokens(self, currentTime: int) -> int:
        # Count all the tokens whose expiration times are greater than the current time.
        return sum(expiration > currentTime for expiration in self.tokens.values())

# Example usage:
# authenticationManager = AuthenticationManager(5)
# authenticationManager.renew("aaa", 1)
# authenticationManager.generate("aaa", 2)
# print(authenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(6))  # Output: 1
# authenticationManager.generate("bbb", 7)
# authenticationManager.renew("aaa", 8)
# authenticationManager.renew("bbb", 10)
# print(authenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(15))  # Output: 0

```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `AuthenticationManager` is instantiated with `timeToLive`, and a dictionary `tokens` is used to hold token IDs and their expiration times.

- **generate(tokenId, currentTime)**: Generates a new token with a specified ID `tokenId` at a given `currentTime`, calculating an expiry time as `currentTime + timeToLive` and storing this expiry time in the `tokens` dictionary.

- **renew(tokenId, currentTime)**: Checks whether a token exists and whether it hasn't expired yet (`currentTime` is less than its stored expiration). If both conditions are met, the token's expiration time is updated to `currentTime + timeToLive`.

- **countUnexpiredTokens(currentTime)**: Simply traverses through `tokens` and counts the number of tokens whose expiration time is greater than the current time `currentTime`, representing the valid (unexpired) tokens.

This implementation maintains efficient operations for token generation, renewal, and counting unexpired tokens, handling up to 2000 calls as noted in the problem's constraints, due to the efficient access patterns provided by Python dictionaries (essentially hashmaps).

# 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String

### Problem Description 
You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a non-empty key.

For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.

You are tasked to evaluate all of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:
Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `valuei`.

If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with a question mark `"?"` (without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return the resulting string after evaluating all of the bracket pairs.


Example 1:
Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
Explanation:
The key "name" has a value of "bob", so replace "(name)" with "bob".

The key "age" has a value of "two", so replace "(age)" with "two".


Example 2:
Input: s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]
Output: "hi?"
Explanation: As you do not know the value of the key "name", replace "(name)" with "?".


Example 3:
Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.

The key "a" has a value of "yes", so replace all occurrences of "(a)" with "yes".

Notice that the "a"s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.


Example 4:
Input: s = "(a)(b)", knowledge = [["a","b"],["b","a"]]
Output: "ba"

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 105`
`0 <= knowledge.length <= 105`
`knowledge[i].length == 2`
`1 <= keyi.length, valuei.length <= 10`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets `'('` and `')'`.

Every open bracket `'('` in `s` will have a corresponding close bracket `')'`.

The key in each bracket pair of `s` will be non-empty.

There will not be any nested bracket pairs in `s`.

`keyi` and `valuei` consist of lowercase English letters.

Each `keyi` in `knowledge` is unique.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, the major tasks include identifying the keys within brackets in the string `s`, searching for these keys in the `knowledge` which we can use a dictionary for quick look-up, and constructing the resultant string based on either finding a value for the key or replacing the key with a question mark if it's not found.

Here's how we approach the solution:

1. Convert the list of lists `knowledge` to a dictionary for rapid key-value look-up.
2. Iterate through the string `s` and detect the keys enclosed by brackets.
3. Replace each found key with its corresponding value if it exists in the dictionary, otherwise, replace it with `?`.
4. Accumulate these replacements and parts of the original string not encased in brackets to form the resultant string.
5. Return the constructed string.

Below is the implementation in Python following the described approach, optimized for use in the given constraints and formatted for direct use on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def evaluate(self, s: str, knowledge: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        # Step 1: Convert knowledge list into a dictionary for quick access
        knowledge_map = {k[0]: k[1] for k in knowledge}
        
        # Resultant string builder
        result = []
        
        # Temp variables to hold current parsing status
        i = 0
        n = len(s)
        
        # Step 2: Process the string s to replace keys
        while i < n:
            if s[i] == '(':
                # Find the closing bracket
                j = i
                while j < n and s[j] != ')':
                    j += 1
                
                # Extract the key (s[i+1:j] excludes the brackets)
                key = s[i+1:j]
                
                # Check if the key is known and append the value or '?'
                if key in knowledge_map:
                    result.append(knowledge_map[key])
                else:
                    result.append('?')
                
                # Move past the closing bracket
                i = j + 1
            else:
                # Append any other characters directly to result
                result.append(s[i])
                i += 1
                
        return ''.join(result)

# Example usage (this comment part won't be necessary for copy-pasting into LeetCode):
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.evaluate("(name)is(age)yearsold", [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]))  # Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
# print(sol.evaluate("hi(name)", [["a","b"]]))  # Output: "hi?"
# print(sol.evaluate("(a)(a)(a)aaa", [["a","yes"]]))  # Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
# print(sol.evaluate("(a)(b)", [["a","b"],["b","a"]]))  # Output: "ba"

```

This solution leverages the linear traversal of the string and efficient dictionary look-ups, achieving good performance suitable for the given string length constraints.

# 1814. Count Nice Pairs in an Array

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `nums` that consists of non-negative integers. Let us define `rev(x)` as the reverse of the non-negative integer `x`. For example, `rev(123) = 321`, and `rev(120) = 21`. A pair of indices `(i, j)` is nice if it satisfies all of the following conditions:
`0 <= i < j < nums.length`
`nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`
Return the number of nice pairs of indices. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [42,11,1,97]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two pairs are:
 - (0,3) : 42 + rev(97) = 42 + 79 = 121, 97 + rev(42) = 97 + 24 = 121.

 - (1,2) : 11 + rev(1) = 11 + 1 = 12, 1 + rev(11) = 1 + 11 = 12.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [13,10,35,24,76]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 Below is the Python code to solve the problem you described. This code uses a dictionary to tally occurrences of equal expressions to simplify the condition check for nice pairs `(i, j)`. This approach effectively counts potential nice pairs by directly evaluating the simplified condition and uses modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.



```python
class Solution:
    def countNicePairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        def rev(x):
            return int(str(x)[::-1])
        
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Initialize the dictionary to count the occurrences of (num - rev(num))
        count = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Variable to store the number of nice pairs
        nice_pairs = 0
        
        # Traverse through the list
        for num in nums:
            reverse_num = rev(num)
            # Calculate the difference
            difference = num - reverse_num
            # Add the number of occurrences of this difference to the nice_pairs
            if difference in count:
                nice_pairs = (nice_pairs + count[difference]) % MOD
            
            # Increment the count of this specific difference
            count[difference] += 1
        
        return nice_pairs

# This code defines a class Solution with a method countNicePairs which expects a list of integers.

# Example Usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.countNicePairs([42,11,1,97]))  # Output: 2
# print(sol.countNicePairs([13,10,35,24,76]))  # Output: 4

```

### Explanation

The problem essentially required checking a simplified condition:
\[ \text{nums}[i] + \text{rev(nums}[j]) = \text{nums}[j] + \text{rev(nums}[i]) \]
which can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{nums}[i] - \text{rev(nums}[i]) = \text{nums}[j] - \text{rev(nums}[j]) \]

Instead of comparing each pair of elements, we use a dictionary to count the occurrences of the value \( x - \text{rev}(x) \) for each element \( x \) in `nums`. For each element, if the difference \( x - \text{rev}(x) \) has been seen before, it means there are previously seen numbers that will form nice pairs with the current number. This discovery is based on the commutative property of addition.

**Algorithm Efficiency:** Given the use of a single pass through the nums array and constant-time operations within the loop (thanks to dictionary operations being average O(1) time), this solution operates in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is efficient given the problem's constraints.

# 1817. Finding the Users Active Minutes

### Problem Description 
You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [IDi, timei]` indicates that the user with `IDi` performed an action at the minute `timei`.

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the number of users whose UAM equals `j`.

Return the array `answer` as described above.


Example 1:
Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).

The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.

Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.


Example 2:
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.

The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.

There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.

Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= logs.length <= 104`
`0 <= IDi <= 109`
`1 <= timei <= 105`
`k` is in the range `[The maximum UAM for a user, 105]`.

### Solution 
 You can solve this problem by following these steps:

1. **Map Users to Active Times**:
   Utilize a dictionary to map each user (`IDi`) to a set of times at which they've executed actions. This set will automatically discard duplicate entries, hence maintaining unique times.

2. **Count Minutes per User**:
   Once logging is complete, you can determine the User Active Minutes (UAM) for each user by simply checking the size of their corresponding set of times.

3. **Build Result Array**:
   Using a list initialized with zeroes of size `k` (since the array is 1-indexed, you might adjust the index calculations accordingly), count how many users have each UAM and populate the corresponding index in the result list.

Let's translate this plan into actual Python code suitable for direct execution on LeetCode.



```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findingUsersActiveMinutes(self, logs: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        user_to_minutes = defaultdict(set)
        
        # Assign every log entry to the respective user's set of active minutes
        for user_id, minute in logs:
            user_to_minutes[user_id].add(minute)
        
        # Prepare the answer array with default 0, to record counts of UAM
        answer = [0] * k
        
        # Count each user's active minute count and update the answer array
        for minutes in user_to_minutes.values():
            uam = len(minutes)  # Unique active minutes for this user
            if uam <= k:
                answer[uam - 1] += 1
        
        return answer

```

### Explanation:
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - **Dictionary (`defaultdict(set)`)**: Efficiently groups each user's unique active minutes.
  - **List (`answer`)**: To hold the count of users for each UAM.

This solution efficiently organizes the logs into a structure where assessment of UAMs becomes direct and straightforward—ultimately ensuring an O(N) complexity where N is the number of logs, followed by O(U) for updating the result list where U is number of unique users (each user processed once). This complexity is efficient given the constraints.
