# 1773. Count Items Matching a Rule

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the `ith` item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `ith` item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
`ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == typei`.

`ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == colori`.

`ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == namei`.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.


Example 1:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].


Example 2:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.


Constraints:
`1 <= items.length <= 104`
`1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10`
`ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.

All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

### Solution 
 Below is the Python code solution for the given problem. It is designed to work on platforms like LeetCode, which require direct functional approaches to solving problems.



```python
class Solution:
    def countMatches(self, items: List[List[str]], ruleKey: str, ruleValue: str) -> int:
        # Mapping ruleKey string to the index in the item's list [type, color, name]
        ruleKeyIndexMap = {'type': 0, 'color': 1, 'name': 2}
        
        # Find the specific index to check based on ruleKey
        index_to_check = ruleKeyIndexMap[ruleKey]
        
        # Count the matches
        count = 0
        for item in items:
            if item[index_to_check] == ruleValue:
                count += 1
        
        return count

# Example testing
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.countMatches([["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], "color", "silver"))  # Output: 1
# print(sol.countMatches([["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], "type", "phone"))  # Output: 2

```

### Explanation:

1. **Mapping the ruleKey**: The solution first establishes a mapping between `ruleKey` values (`"type"`, `"color"`, and `"name"`) and their respective indices in the items' sublists (`0`, `1`, `2`). This helps to dynamically access the correct item attribute based on the provided `ruleKey`.

2. **Setting the index to check**: `index_to_check` is assigned using the `ruleKeyIndexMap`, which uses `ruleKey` to find the right index.

3. **Counting matches**: The solution then iterates over each item in the `items` list. For each item, it checks if the attribute at `index_to_check` matches the `ruleValue`. If it matches, the count is incremented by one.

4. **Return the total count**: Finally, the count of all matching items is returned.

This solution is efficient with respect to both time (O(n), where n is the number of items, as each item is checked exactly once) and space (O(1), no extra space proportional to input size is used, just a few extra variables for counting and accessing mappings). This ensures that the solution suits the constraints provided.

# 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate

### Problem Description 
You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each `points[i] = [ai, bi]` represents that a point exists at `(ai, bi)`. A point is valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return the index (0-indexed) of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the smallest index. If there are no valid points, return `-1`.

The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)`.


Example 1:
Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.


Example 2:
Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The answer is allowed to be on the same location as your current location.


Example 3:
Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[2,3]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no valid points.


Constraints:
`1 <= points.length <= 104`
`points[i].length == 2`
`1 <= x, y, ai, bi <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem described, we need to find the closest valid point (sharing the same x or y coordinate with our current location) from a list and return its index. If no valid point exists, we return -1. Let's break down our approach:

1. Loop through the list of points.
2. Check if a point shares the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate with the current location `(x, y)`.
3. Calculate the Manhattan distance for valid points.
4. Track the smallest Manhattan distance and the corresponding index.
5. Return the index of the point with the minimum valid distance or -1 if no valid point exists.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def nearestValidPoint(self, x: int, y: int, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        min_distance = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum distance to infinity.
        min_index = -1  # Initialize the index as -1 to return if no point is valid. 

        for i, (ai, bi) in enumerate(points):
            if ai == x or bi == y:
                # Calculate Manhattan distance for valid points
                distance = abs(x - ai) + abs(y - bi)
                # Update the minimum distance and the corresponding valid point index
                if distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = distance
                    min_index = i
        
        return min_index

# This can be tested using the examples on LeetCode

```

This solution is designed to follow the constraints and efficiently find the correct index (or -1 if not found). The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of points, due to the single loop that tests each point, and the space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space.

This code is ready to be run on LeetCode for further testing and submission.

# 1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation

### Problem Description 
You are given an even integer `n`​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation `perm` of size `n`​​ where `perm[i] == i`​ (0-indexed)​​​​.

In one operation, you will create a new array `arr`, and for each `i`:
If `i % 2 == 0`, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.

If `i % 2 == 1`, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.

You will then assign `arr`​​​​ to `perm`.

Return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on `perm` to return the permutation to its initial value.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: perm = [0,1] initially.

After the 1st operation, perm = [0,1]
So it takes only 1 operation.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: perm = [0,1,2,3] initially.

After the 1st operation, perm = [0,2,1,3]
After the 2nd operation, perm = [0,1,2,3]
So it takes only 2 operations.


Example 3:
Input: n = 6
Output: 4

Constraints:
`2 <= n <= 1000`
`n`​​​​​​ is even.

### Solution 
 The problem describes a permutation operation on an array initialized with indices, and we need to determine how many such operations are required to return the array to its original form. The permutation reindexing scheme is given by:
- `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]` if `i` is even
- `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]` if `i` is odd

This permutation works somewhat like a shuffle operation, where the first half and second half of the list are mixed according to specific rules.

The challenge is to figure out after how many such operations the list (permutation) returns to its initial order. This can be tackled as finding the order of the permutation cycle, which represents the smallest number of cycles needed to bring the permutation back to its original order.

Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it:
1. Implement the permutation operation described.
2. Apply the permutation in a loop and check after each operation if the array has returned to its initial configuration.
3. Return the number of operations needed.

Below is the Python solution implementing the above approach, which is tailored for submission on LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def reinitializePermutation(self, n: int) -> int:
        perm = list(range(n))
        original = list(range(n))
        count = 0

        while True:
            arr = [0]*n
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    arr[i] = perm[i // 2]
                else:
                    arr[i] = perm[n // 2 + (i - 1) // 2]
            
            count += 1
            perm = arr
            
            if perm == original:
                break

        return count

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.reinitializePermutation(2))  # Output: 1
print(sol.reinitializePermutation(4))  # Output: 2
print(sol.reinitializePermutation(6))  # Output: 4

```

### Explanation:
- First, we initialize `perm` with values from `0` to `n-1`.
- We then perform the described permutation operations in each iteration of the loop.
- We count each operation and check if the permutation `perm` matches the original sequence.
- The loop will exit when `perm` returns to the initial configuration `original`, and count is returned as the result.

This solution works efficiently within the constraints given (up to `n=1000`). Each operation creates a new list, and after a few repetitions, the permutation cycles back to the initial state. The number of operations is manageable and runs in a very acceptable time for given constraints.

# 1814. Count Nice Pairs in an Array

### Problem Description 
You are given an array `nums` that consists of non-negative integers. Let us define `rev(x)` as the reverse of the non-negative integer `x`. For example, `rev(123) = 321`, and `rev(120) = 21`. A pair of indices `(i, j)` is nice if it satisfies all of the following conditions:
`0 <= i < j < nums.length`
`nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`
Return the number of nice pairs of indices. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [42,11,1,97]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two pairs are:
 - (0,3) : 42 + rev(97) = 42 + 79 = 121, 97 + rev(42) = 97 + 24 = 121.

 - (1,2) : 11 + rev(1) = 11 + 1 = 12, 1 + rev(11) = 1 + 11 = 12.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [13,10,35,24,76]
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem efficiently, we can break it down with a key observation:

Rearranging the equation `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])` gives:
`nums[i] - rev(nums[i]) == nums[j] - rev(nums[j])`

Thus, pairs are "nice" when the difference between a number and its reverse is the same. To exploit this, we can map the difference `nums[i] - rev(nums[i])` to counts using a dictionary and calculate combinations of pairs within the dataset that satisfy the equation.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. Create a function `reverse` to compute the reverse of a number.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums`, compute `diff = num - reverse(num)`, and record the occurrence of each difference using a dictionary.
3. For each unique difference where the count is greater than one, calculate the number of ways to pick two indices `(i, j)` (this is a combination calculation): `count * (count - 1) / 2`.
4. Return the total count of nice pairs modulo `10**9 + 7`.

This leads to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, since we loop through the list and calculate using efficient map operations.

Here's the solution implemented in Python suitable for execution on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def countNicePairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        def reverse(x):
            return int(str(x)[::-1])

        difference_count = {}
        nice_pairs = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            reversed_num = reverse(num)
            diff = num - reversed_num
            
            if diff in difference_count:
                nice_pairs = (nice_pairs + difference_count[diff]) % MOD
            
            if diff in difference_count:
                difference_count[diff] += 1
            else:
                difference_count[diff] = 1
        
        return nice_pairs

# Example Usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.countNicePairs([42,11,1,97])) # Output: 2
# print(sol.countNicePairs([13,10,35,24,76])) # Output: 4

```

This code defines the `Solution` class with the `countNicePairs` method that processes inputs as described, using a helper function `reverse()` for reversing integer digits.

# 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game

### Problem Description 
There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for `1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the `1st` friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:
Start at the `1st` friend.

Count the next `k` friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.

The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.

If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step `2` starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.

Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

Given the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return the winner of the game.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
1) Start at friend 1.

2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.

3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.

4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.

5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.

6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.

7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.

8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.

9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.


Example 2:
Input: n = 6, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.


Constraints:
`1 <= k <= n <= 500`

### Solution 
 This problem can be effectively solved using the simulation of the described process. We can simulate the friends sitting in a circle using a list. When a friend is eliminated, we remove them from this list, and continue until only one friend remains. This approach leverages list operations heavily but requires careful management of the current position after each elimination.

Here is the Python code in LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def findTheWinner(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Create a list of friends from 1 to n
        friends = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Start from the first friend (index 0)
        current_index = 0
        
        # Continue playing until only one friend remains
        while len(friends) > 1:
            # Calculate the index to remove;
            # (current_index + k - 1) % len(friends) handles the circle's wrap-around
            remove_index = (current_index + k - 1) % len(friends)
            
            # Remove the friend
            friends.pop(remove_index)
            
            # The next current index is where the removed index was, but since we've
            # removed the element, it automatically points to the next person in the circle
            current_index = remove_index
            
            # If the current_index reaches the end of the list, it should wrap around
            # This happens naturally by the modulus operation in the list indexing
            if current_index == len(friends):
                current_index = 0
        
        # The last remaining element in the list is the winner
        return friends[0]

# Example use case:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findTheWinner(5, 2))  # Output: 3
print(sol.findTheWinner(6, 5))  # Output: 1

```

**Explanation:**
1. All friends are stored in a list named `friends`.
2. We initiate the current index from which counting begins.
3. In each loop iteration, we determine which friend should be removed according to the game's rules.
4. We compute the index to remove by adding `k` to the `current_index`, subtracting 1 (because counting is inclusive), and then using the modulus operation with respect to the current length of the list to handle wrapping around.
5. After removing an element, the current index is adjusted to the immediate next friend, considering wrap-around by list length.
6. This process continues until only one friend remains, who is considered the winner.

This approach efficiently removes elements from the list and carries out the game's rules using modular arithmetic to ensure correctness in circle traversal.
