# 1628. Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function

### Problem Description 
Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return the binary expression tree that represents this expression.

Postfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]`.

The class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.

A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

Follow up: Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing `evaluate` implementation?

Example 1:
Input: s = ["3","4","+","2","*","7","/"]
Output: 2
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression (`(3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.`

Example 2:
Input: s = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]
Output: -16
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-`(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.`

Example 3:
Input: s = ["4","2","+","3","5","1","-","*","+"]
Output: 18

Example 4:
Input: s = ["100","200","+","2","/","5","*","7","+"]
Output: 757

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length < 100`
`s.length` is odd.

`s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.

If `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `105`.

It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.

The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed `109`.

It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of constructing a binary expression tree from a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), we can follow a systematic approach. 

## Steps and Explanation

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation, the operators follow their operands. For example, to evaluate the expression `4*(5-(7+2))`, we would represent it in postfix notation as `["4", "5", "7", "2", "+", "-", "*"]`. Here `+`, `-`, and `*` are operators that should combine their adjacent operands.

2. **Binary Expression Tree**: A binary expression tree is a binary tree where:
   - Leaf nodes contain operands (numbers).
   - Internal nodes contain operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`).

3. **Node Class**: We'll define a `Node` class that represents a tree node. It should contain references to the left and right children and have an `evaluate` method to compute the result of the expression represented by the tree.

4. **Constructing the Tree**: We can use a stack to help build the tree:
   - Traverse each token in the postfix expression.
   - If the token is a number, create a leaf node and push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator, pop the two top nodes from the stack, create a new internal node for the operator, and connect the nodes as its left and right children. Push this new node back onto the stack.

5. **Final Result**: At the end of the traversal, the stack should contain one node, which is the root of the binary expression tree.

6. **Evaluating the Tree**: The `evaluate` method will recursively compute the value of the expression.

### Implementation in Python

Here's how you can implement this solution in Python, suitable for running on LeetCode.



```python
class Node:
    def evaluate(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden in subclasses.")

class OperandNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def evaluate(self):
        return self.value

class OperatorNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, left, right, operator):
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.operator = operator

    def evaluate(self):
        if self.operator == '+':
            return self.left.evaluate() + self.right.evaluate()
        elif self.operator == '-':
            return self.left.evaluate() - self.right.evaluate()
        elif self.operator == '*':
            return self.left.evaluate() * self.right.evaluate()
        elif self.operator == '/':
            return self.left.evaluate() // self.right.evaluate()  # Use integer division

class Solution:
    def buildExpressionTree(self, postfix):
        stack = []
        
        for token in postfix:
            if token.lstrip('-').isdigit():  # Check if token is a number (also handle negative numbers)
                node = OperandNode(int(token))
                stack.append(node)
            else:
                right = stack.pop()
                left = stack.pop()
                node = OperatorNode(left, right, token)
                stack.append(node)

        return stack.pop()  # The root of the expression tree

# To evaluate the built tree, you can define the following function which can be called after building the tree:
def evaluate_expression_tree(postfix):
    solution = Solution()
    root = solution.buildExpressionTree(postfix)
    return root.evaluate()

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Node Class**: Abstract base class for expression nodes.
- **OperandNode Class**: Inherits from `Node`, represents an operand (leaf node).
- **OperatorNode Class**: Inherits from `Node`, represents an operator (internal node).
- **buildExpressionTree Method**: Constructs the tree based on the postfix expression using a stack.
- **evaluate_expression_tree Function**: Facilitates evaluating the tree for given postfix input.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the postfix expression.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case, where most tokens are operands.

This implementation effectively constructs a binary expression tree from a postfix expression and provides a method to evaluate the expression represented by the tree.
