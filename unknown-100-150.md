### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you've provided the beginning of a problem related to SQL schema, but there isn't a specific problem statement included in your request. To write a complete solution in Python, we typically need a clear problem definition, such as what the input looks like, what the expected output is, and any constraints or requirements.

Could you please provide the full problem statement? If you're looking to see how to structure a Python solution to a specific coding problem, including SQL schemas or database-related tasks, providing the details will help me assist you more effectively. 

For now, I'll provide a generic template for how you might structure a solution for a problem in Python on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def my_function(self, param1: int, param2: str) -> int:
        # Your logic here
        
        # Example return value
        return result

```

### Explanation of the Code Structure:

1. **Class Definition (`class Solution:`)**: 
   - LeetCode generally requires you to define a class named `Solution`.

2. **Method Definition**: 
   - Inside this class, you define a method (like `my_function`) that matches the function signature given in the problem statement.
   - The parameters will generally represent the inputs that the function will receive.

3. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - Inside the method, you implement the core logic that solves the problem.

4. **Return Statement**: 
   - Finally, the method should return the result according to the problem's requirements.

Please provide more details about the specific problem you need help with, and I can create an accurate and complete solution for you.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It appears that your message was cut off before describing the specific problem or SQL schema you would like assistance with. Please clarify the exact problem statement or provide the SQL schema that relates to it. 

However, I can show you a general template for solving problems on LeetCode using Python. 

### Python Template for LeetCode Solutions

A typical LeetCode solution involves defining a class, implementing a method, and ensuring that the method has a specific signature. Below is a generic format you can use:



```python
class Solution:
    def method_name(self, parameters) -> return_type:
        # Your algorithm implementation here
        pass

```

### Example Problem 
Let’s say we need to solve a common algorithmic problem like "Two Sum".

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### Solution

1. **Identify Input and Output**
   - Input: List of integers `nums`, an integer `target`.
   - Output: List of two integers representing indices.

2. **Approach**
   - We can use a dictionary to keep track of numbers we have seen and their indices.
   - As we iterate through the array, we check if the complement (i.e., `target - current_number`) exists in the dictionary.

### Python Code (LeetCode Format)



```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = {}
        
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], index]
            num_to_index[num] = index
            
        return []  # Return an empty list if no solution is found

```

### Explanation

1. **Dictionary for Storage**: We maintain a dictionary `num_to_index` where keys are the numbers and values are their corresponding indices.
   
2. **Iterate Through the List**: We use the `enumerate` function to loop through `nums` with both the index and the current number.
  
3. **Check for Complement**: For each number, we compute the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the `target`. We check if this complement exists in our dictionary:
   - If it exists, we return a list containing the indices of the complement and the current number.
   - If not, we store the current number and its index in the dictionary.

4. **Return Statement**: This solution will always find a solution based on the problem’s constraints; however, in practice, it’s good form to return an empty list if no solution is found.

### How to Run on LeetCode

1. Copy the code above.
2. Go to the LeetCode website and find the problem you want to solve.
3. Paste the code into the code editor provided on the problem page.

# 1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String

### Problem Description 
Given strings `A` and `B` of the same length, we say A[i] and B[i] are equivalent characters. For example, if `A = "abc"` and `B = "cde"`, then we have `'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', 'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'
Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'
Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'
For example, given the equivalency information from `A` and `B` above, `S = "eed"`, `"acd"`, and `"aab"` are equivalent strings, and `"aab"` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S`.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S` by using the equivalency information from `A` and `B`.


Example 1:
Input: A = "parker", B = "morris", S = "parser"
Output: "makkek"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in `A` and `B`, we can group their characters as `[m,p]`, `[a,o]`, `[k,r,s]`, `[e,i]`. The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order. So the answer is `"makkek"`.


Example 2:
Input: A = "hello", B = "world", S = "hold"
Output: "hdld"
Explanation:  Based on the equivalency information in `A` and `B`, we can group their characters as `[h,w]`, `[d,e,o]`, `[l,r]`. So only the second letter `'o'` in `S` is changed to `'d'`, the answer is `"hdld"`.


Example 3:
Input: A = "leetcode", B = "programs", S = "sourcecode"
Output: "aauaaaaada"
Explanation:  We group the equivalent characters in `A` and `B` as `[a,o,e,r,s,c]`, `[l,p]`, `[g,t]` and `[d,m]`, thus all letters in `S` except `'u'` and `'d'` are transformed to `'a'`, the answer is `"aauaaaaada"`.

Note:
String `A`, `B` and `S` consist of only lowercase English letters from `'a'` - `'z'`.

The lengths of string `A`, `B` and `S` are between `1` and `1000`.

String `A` and `B` are of the same length.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest equivalent string based on the equivalence relationships defined by strings `A` and `B`, we can use the Union-Find (disjoint-set) data structure. This will help to efficiently group equivalent characters.

Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We'll implement a Union-Find to track which characters (from 'a' to 'z') are connected based on their equivalence as defined by `A` and `B`.

2. **Union Operation**: For every pair of characters `A[i]` and `B[i]`, we will perform a union operation to connect these two characters.

3. **Find Operation**: For each character in string `S`, we will find the representative of its equivalent class and map it to its smallest character.

4. **Construction of Result**: We will construct the resulting string based on the mapping of characters to their smallest representatives.

5. **Lexicographical Order**: The union operation will ensure that we represent equivalent characters by their lexicographically smallest character.

Here’s how the code would look:



```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = {}
        
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            # Connect both roots
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
    
    def add(self, x):
        if x not in self.parent:
            self.parent[x] = x  # Initially, the parent of x is itself

class Solution:
    def smallestEquivalentString(self, A: str, B: str, S: str) -> str:
        uf = UnionFind()
        
        # Add all characters present in A and B to the Union-Find structure
        for a in A:
            uf.add(a)
        for b in B:
            uf.add(b)
        
        # Union the corresponding characters from A and B
        for a, b in zip(A, B):
            uf.union(a, b)
        
        # Create a dictionary to store the lexicographically smallest equivalent character
        smallest = {}
        for c in uf.parent.keys():
            root = uf.find(c)
            if root not in smallest:
                smallest[root] = c
            else:
                smallest[root] = min(smallest[root], c)  # Keep the smallest in lexicographical order
        
        # Construct the result string based on the mappings found
        result = []
        for char in S:
            root = uf.find(char)
            result.append(smallest[root])  # Replace with the smallest equivalent character
        
        return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.smallestEquivalentString("parker", "morris", "parser"))  # Output: "makkek"
# print(sol.smallestEquivalentString("hello", "world", "hold"))      # Output: "hdld"
# print(sol.smallestEquivalentString("leetcode", "programs", "sourcecode"))  # Output: "aauaaaaada"

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Union-Find Class**: The `UnionFind` class contains methods for `find`, `union`, and `add`. This is a standard setup for the disjoint-set data structure.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize a `UnionFind` instance and add each character from `A` and `B` to ensure they are part of our union-find structure.

3. **Union Operation**: By iterating through each index in `A` and `B`, we apply the union operation to connect each `A[i]` to `B[i]`.

4. **Finding the Smallest Character**: For each character tracked in the union-find, we store the smallest representative character for each set.

5. **Result Construction**: Finally, we construct the output string by replacing each character in `S` with its corresponding smallest equivalent character found in the previous step.

This method efficiently handles the equivalency relations and constructs the desired output string in linear time relative to the length of the inputs.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! It appears you might want help with a specific SQL related problem that could be represented in Python, often in the context of LeetCode problems. However, you haven't provided the actual problem statement or SQL schema. 

To help you effectively, I will construct an example problem based on a common SQL scenario and provide a solution in Python, as you requested. 

### Problem Example:
Let's imagine a scenario where we have two tables: `Employees` and `Departments`. 

**Employees Table:**

```
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | dept_id |
+-------------+---------+
| 1           | 1       |
| 2           | 2       |
| 3           | 1       |
| 4           | 3       |
| 5           | NULL    |
+-------------+---------+

```

**Departments Table:**

```
+---------+-----------+
| dept_id | dept_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 1       | Sales     |
| 2       | Engineering|
| 3       | HR        |
+---------+-----------+

```

### Problem Statement:
Write a SQL query to find the names of departments that do not have any employees assigned to them. 

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT d.dept_name
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL;

```

### Python Equivalent:
To solve the above problem in Python, we will simulate the database with a couple of lists, and then implement the logic.

Here's how you would structure a solution in Python:



```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_departments_without_employees(departments: List[Tuple[int, str]], 
                                        employees: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[str]:
    # Create a set of department IDs that have employees
    employed_depts = {emp[1] for emp in employees if emp[1] is not None}
    
    # Prepare the result list for department names without employees
    result = []
    
    for dept_id, dept_name in departments:
        if dept_id not in employed_depts:
            result.append(dept_name)
    
    return result

# Example Data
departments = [(1, 'Sales'), (2, 'Engineering'), (3, 'HR')]
employees = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, None)]

# Function Call
print(find_departments_without_employees(departments, employees))

```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `departments`: A list of tuples representing the department ID and name.
   - `employees`: A list of tuples representing the employee ID and their corresponding department ID.

2. **Creating a Set**: 
   - We create a set called `employed_depts` from the `employees` list. This stores department IDs that have at least one employee. 

3. **Iterating through Departments**:
   - We iterate over the `departments` list and check if the department ID is in the `employed_depts` set. If it's not, we add the department name to the result list.

4. **Return Result**: 
   - Finally, we return the list of department names that do not have any employees.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N is the number of departments and M is the number of employees, due to the iterations over both lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), for storing employed department IDs.

This setup and implementation format aligns with how you would structure a solution on the LeetCode platform, making it runnable directly after replacing the example data with the actual input formats specified in the problem. 

Feel free to provide the actual problem or schema if you have something specific in mind!

# 1069. Product Sales Analysis II

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Let me guide you through the process of constructing a Python solution for a LeetCode problem. However, it appears that there might be a misunderstanding regarding the problem description. The message references an SQL schema but doesn't specify an actual problem or table structure to solve.

For the sake of this example, let's assume we have a common SQL-related problem based on a hypothetical schema. I'll create a scenario involving a "Users" table, and we will write a Python function that can be run as a solution on LeetCode.

### Hypothetical Problem Statement

**Problem:** Write a SQL query to find the name of the users who have an email address ending with '@gmail.com'.

**SQL Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

```

### LeetCode Solution Format

Now, let’s write the solution in Python as if it were going to be submitted on LeetCode. In Python, we would typically use an ORM or directly execute SQL queries, but for this scenario, I’ll present the SQL statement that should be used to solve the problem, as Python execution is generally not applicable directly in SQL environments.

However, since the problem is fundamentally SQL-based, I will provide a sample code snippet that could be run using an SQLite database connection or a similar backend.

### Python Code



```python
import sqlite3

def find_users_with_gmail():
    # Connect to the database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create Users table (for demonstration purposes)
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT NOT NULL,
            email TEXT NOT NULL
        )
    ''')
    
    # Sample data
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@gmail.com')")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Users (name, email) VALUES ('Bob', 'bob@yahoo.com')")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Users (name, email) VALUES ('Charlie', 'charlie@gmail.com')")
    conn.commit()

    # SQL query to find names of users with Gmail addresses
    cursor.execute('''
        SELECT name FROM Users
        WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com'
    ''')
    
    # Fetch all results
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Process results
    gmail_users = [row[0] for row in results]
    
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
    
    return gmail_users

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_users_with_gmail())

```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Database Connection**: The code creates a connection to an SQLite database named `users.db`.

2. **Table Creation**: It defines a `Users` table if it doesn't already exist with columns for `id`, `name`, and `email`.

3. **Sample Data**: It inserts sample data into the table. In a real scenario, this step would be unnecessary since the table would already be populated.

4. **SQL Query**: The main logic is contained within the SQL query that retrieves names of users whose emails end with `@gmail.com`. The SQL `LIKE` operator with the wildcard `%` is used for this purpose.

5. **Fetch Results**: The results of the query are fetched and processed into a list of names.

6. **Close Connection**: Finally, the database connection is closed before returning the list of users with Gmail addresses.

### Important Note
This code is designed for execution in a standalone Python environment where SQLite is available. On a LeetCode environment specifically meant for SQL submissions, you would provide just the SQL query directly, not a Python function. 

If you have a specific SQL problem you want help with, please provide the details, and I can create a tailored solution with the necessary context!

# 1070. Product Sales Analysis III

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like you're asking for help with a SQL schema problem, but you've not provided the specific details of the SQL schema or the question you want to solve. However, I can help you create a Python solution for common SQL-related problems, typically found on platforms like LeetCode.

If you were asking for a solution related to a specific SQL problem, I can help with a generic example and a detailed Python implementation.

### Example Problem: "Combine Two Tables"

#### SQL Schema
You have two tables, `Person` and `Address`. Here's the schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Person (
    Id INT,
    Name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Address (
    PersonId INT,
    City VARCHAR(255),
    State VARCHAR(255)
);

```

#### Problem Statement
Write a SQL query to combine these two tables and return the following columns:
- `Person.Name`
- `Address.City`
- `Address.State`

If a person does not have an address, the corresponding values for City and State should be NULL.

### SQL Query
Here's how the SQL query for the above problem might look:


```sql
SELECT Person.Name, Address.City, Address.State
FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address 
ON Person.Id = Address.PersonId;

```

### LeetCode Format: Python Solution

If you need a Python solution for this problem as it might appear on LeetCode (though more commonly, you would provide an SQL code submission there), we typically wouldn't convert SQL directly to Python if it's about querying databases, but you might have similar problems using DataFrames if using libraries like Pandas. Below is a Python example using Pandas to achieve a similar result:



```python
import pandas as pd
from typing import List, Tuple

# Define the function to combine two tables and return the desired values
def combine_tables(persons: List[Tuple[int, str]], addresses: List[Tuple[int, str, str]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Create DataFrames from the input lists
    person_df = pd.DataFrame(persons, columns=['Id', 'Name'])
    address_df = pd.DataFrame(addresses, columns=['PersonId', 'City', 'State'])
    
    # Perform a left join based on Id from person and PersonId from address
    combined_df = pd.merge(person_df, address_df, how='left', left_on='Id', right_on='PersonId')
    
    # Select the required columns
    result_df = combined_df[['Name', 'City', 'State']]
    
    return result_df

# Example usage:
persons = [(1, "Alice"), (2, "Bob"), (3, "Charlie")]
addresses = [(1, "New York", "NY"), (2, "Los Angeles", "CA")]

# Call the function
combined_result = combine_tables(persons, addresses)

# Display the result
print(combined_result)

```

### Explanation
1. **Data Preparation**: We first define two input lists, `persons` and `addresses`, that represent our SQL tables.
2. **Creating DataFrames**: We use Pandas to create DataFrames from these input lists.
3. **Left Join**: We use `pd.merge` to perform a left join on the `Id` column of the persons DataFrame and the `PersonId` column of the addresses DataFrame.
4. **Selecting Columns**: Finally, we select only the required columns, `Name`, `City`, and `State`.

This code runs directly in a Python environment, and the logic mirrors a relational database join, as would have been done in SQL. This pattern allows you to work with Python to manipulate and analyze your data similarly to how you would in a SQL database.

If you have a different problem or additional details, please provide that, and I would be happy to help further!

# 1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows

### Problem Description 
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `matrix`.

You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from `0` to `1` or vice versa).

Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.


Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.


Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.


Constraints:
`m == matrix.length`
`n == matrix[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 300`
`matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of maximizing the number of rows in a binary matrix that have all values equal after flipping some columns, we need to find a systematic way to determine which rows can be made identical by choosing appropriate columns to flip.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Understanding Row Patterns**: 
   Each row in the matrix can be represented as a binary string. For example, a row `[0, 1, 0]` can be treated as a string `010`. Our goal is to make as many rows as possible identical by flipping certain columns.

2. **Identifying Flips Required**:
   When considering flipping a column, it flips all 0s in that column to 1s and 1s to 0s. If we consider two rows, we can determine a "pattern" for the row if we assume we can flip some columns. The pattern can be represented in terms of its 'flipped' state compared to a chosen row.

3. **Creating Normalized Row Patterns**:
   For each row, we can create a normalized pattern that indicates what the row would look like if we were transforming it to match a reference row (typically the first row). This normalized pattern helps in counting matches of rows that can be made identical.

4. **Using a Dictionary to Count Patterns**:
   We use a dictionary to count how many rows can map to the same normalized pattern. The key of the dictionary will be the normalized pattern, and the value will be the count of rows that can match that pattern.

5. **Finding the Maximum Count**:
   Finally, the maximum value in our dictionary will give us the maximum number of rows that can be made identical after some flips.

### Implementation

Here is the Python code that implements the above logic following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxEqualRowsAfterFlips(self, matrix):
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        pattern_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        for row in matrix:
            # Create a pattern that should be the same after choosing some flips
            # Store the 'flipped' state relative to the first column's value
            # If first element of the row is 0, keep it as is
            # If it is 1, flip the entire row
            normalized_pattern = tuple((cell ^ row[0]) for cell in row)
            pattern_count[normalized_pattern] += 1
        
        return max(pattern_count.values())

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Imports**: We import `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to easily count the occurrences of normalized patterns.
2. **Loop Through Rows**: We iterate through each row in the matrix.
3. **Create Normalized Pattern**: For each row, we generate a tuple that represents the normalized pattern. If the first element is 0, we keep the row as it is; if it’s 1, we flip the entire row.
4. **Count Patterns**: We increment the count of that pattern in the `pattern_count` dictionary.
5. **Return Maximum Count**: Finally, we return the maximum value found in `pattern_count`, which gives the desired result.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We iterate through each row and process each cell.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), the space needed to store the unique patterns in the dictionary.

This implementation effectively maximizes the number of rows that can be made identical under the column flip operation, providing a clear and efficient solution to the problem.

# 1075. Project Employees I

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you started asking for a problem involving SQL schema but didn't describe the specific problem you'd like solved. Since SQL problems on LeetCode often involve querying databases or manipulating data based on specific conditions, I'll assume you're looking for a SQL solution.

**Example Problem Statement:**
Let’s say we have a SQL table named `Employees` with the following schema:


```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar   |
| department  | varchar   |
| salary      | int      |

```

Here, `id` is the primary key, and you want to write a SQL query to find the names and salaries of employees who earn more than the average salary of their respective department.

## SQL Query Solution

Here's how we can structure the SQL query:

1. First, we need to calculate the average salary for each department.
2. Then, we compare each employee's salary with their department's average salary.
3. Finally, we'll retrieve their names and salaries for those who earn more.

### SQL Code:


```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM Employees AS E
    WHERE E.department = Employees.department
)

```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT name, salary:** This selects the columns we want to return in our result.
- **FROM Employees:** This specifies the table from which we are querying the data.
- **WHERE salary > (...):** This is a condition that only includes employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their department.
    - **(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees AS E WHERE E.department = Employees.department):** This subquery calculates the average salary of employees in the same department. This is done by comparing each employee's department with the outer query's department (`Employees.department`) using a correlated subquery.
  
### Conclusion:
This SQL query can be directly tested in the LeetCode environment that supports SQL. If you have a different problem statement in mind, please provide more specific details and I would be glad to assist you!

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! It seems like you didn't provide the full details of the problem from LeetCode, including the SQL schema and the specific requirements for the task you're trying to solve. 

However, I can provide you with a generic structure for a solution in Python, which can be applied to a LeetCode problem that involves SQL schemas and typically requires writing a SQL query to solve it.

For example, let’s assume we have the following SQL schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    total DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);

```

Let's say the problem is: **Find all users who have placed more than two orders.**

### Problem Statement
Write a SQL query to find the id and name of users who have made more than two orders.

### SQL Query Solution

You can solve this problem using a SQL query that joins the `Users` and `Orders` table and uses a `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of orders per user. Here is how the SQL query might look:


```sql
SELECT U.id, U.name
FROM Users U
JOIN Orders O ON U.id = O.user_id
GROUP BY U.id, U.name
HAVING COUNT(O.id) > 2;

```

### Explanation of the Query

1. **SELECT U.id, U.name**: We select the user's id and name from the `Users` table.
2. **FROM Users U**: We are querying from the `Users` table and giving it an alias `U`.
3. **JOIN Orders O ON U.id = O.user_id**: We perform an inner join on the `Orders` table with the alias `O`, using the condition that the user's `id` matches the `user_id` in the `Orders` table.
4. **GROUP BY U.id, U.name**: We group the results by user `id` and `name`, which allows us to count the number of orders per user.
5. **HAVING COUNT(O.id) > 2**: This condition filters the groups to return only those users who have more than 2 orders.

### Python Code Structure for LeetCode

If you are using Python to interact with a database or run SQL commands within a LeetCode-style environment, the LeetCode submission might look like this:



```python
class Solution:
    def findUsersWithMoreThanTwoOrders(self):
        return """
        SELECT U.id, U.name
        FROM Users U
        JOIN Orders O ON U.id = O.user_id
        GROUP BY U.id, U.name
        HAVING COUNT(O.id) > 2;
        """

```

### Explanation of the Python Code

- We define a class `Solution`, which is commonly used in LeetCode problems.
- We define the method `findUsersWithMoreThanTwoOrders`, which returns the SQL query as a string.

### Note

Make sure to adjust the SQL query according to the actual problem statement and schema provided by LeetCode. If you provide the specific problem details or requirements, I can further customize this solution to meet those needs directly!

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that your request was cut off and you haven't provided a complete description of the problem you're facing. However, if it's related to an SQL schema or similar, I can demonstrate how to solve a common SQL problem using Python. If you have a specific SQL schema problem in mind, please provide more details.

In case you're looking for a LeetCode-style problem involving SQL schema, I'll go ahead and demonstrate how to work with a hypothetical SQL schema problem and provide a Python solution example.

Let's consider a popular LeetCode problem involving tables. For instance, let's say we have two tables: `Employees` and `Departments`. The `Employees` table has the following schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

```

The `Departments` table has the following schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

```

### Problem Statement:
We want to find the count of employees in each department. If a department has no employees, we want it to return 0 for that department.

### SQL Query:
To tackle this, the SQL query would look something like this:


```sql
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name;

```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **FROM Departments d**: Start from the `Departments` table and give it an alias `d`.
2. **LEFT JOIN Employees e**: Using a LEFT JOIN to include all departments, even those that don’t have any employees.
3. **ON d.department_id = e.department_id**: Join the two tables on the department ID.
4. **GROUP BY**: Group the results by department ID and name, allowing us to count employees per department.
5. **COUNT(e.employee_id)**: Count the number of employee IDs in each department; if there are no employees, this will return 0.

### Python Code Format for LeetCode:

LeetCode typically does not require you to write SQL queries in Python for database-related problems, but you can simulate running such a logic using Python if necessary. Here’s a simple Python program to achieve the same logic without an actual database:



```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample data for demonstration
employees = [
    {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "department_id": 1},
    {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "department_id": 2},
    {"employee_id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "department_id": 1},
]

departments = [
    {"department_id": 1, "department_name": "HR"},
    {"department_id": 2, "department_name": "Engineering"},
    {"department_id": 3, "department_name": "Sales"},  # No employees
]

def count_employees_in_departments(departments, employees):
    # Create a dictionary to hold employee count per department
    department_count = defaultdict(int)

    # Count the number of employees in each department
    for emp in employees:
        department_count[emp["department_id"]] += 1

    # Create a result list to hold the final output
    result = []
    
    for dept in departments:
        dept_id = dept["department_id"]
        dept_name = dept["department_name"]
        # Get the count of employees or 0 if none exist
        emp_count = department_count[dept_id]
        result.append({"department_name": dept_name, "employee_count": emp_count})

    return result

# Execute the function
output = count_employees_in_departments(departments, employees)
print(output)

```

### Explanation of the Python Code:
1. We used `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to count the number of employees in each department. This allows easy incrementing of counts without checking if the key exists.
2. We loop through the `employees` list, and for each employee, we increment the count for their respective department.
3. We then create a result list, iterating over the `departments` to populate it with the department name and the corresponding employee count (defaulting to 0 for departments without employees).
4. Finally, we call the function and print the output, which will display the number of employees in each department.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like your request got cut off, specifically, the SQL schema portion and the problem statement. However, I can provide you with a general template for a Python solution on LeetCode and explain how to structure it based on common patterns for SQL-related problems.

### Template Code Explanation

In LeetCode, problems involving SQL can sometimes be accompanied by a well-defined structure for the input and output. Below, I've outlined a possible structure and created a generic Python function that could fit a typical SQL-related problem, assuming it's focused on some data retrieval task.

### Generic Problem Structure

Let's assume a problem where you need to join two tables and return some specific fields. Here’s how you can structure it in Python:

1. **Read from the SQL Schema**: Use SQLAlchemy or PyMySQL, although directly using SQL is often part of the problem prompt.
2. **Translate the SQL query into Python logic**: If the problem involves data manipulation, implement it logic in Python.

Below is an illustrative solution template using Python. Modify it according to the specific SQL Schema and problem given.

### Example Problem


```sql
Table Users:
+-----------+---------+
| user_id   | name    |
+-----------+---------+
| Integer   | String  |
+-----------+---------+

Table Messages:
+-----------+---------------+-----------+
| message_id| user_id       | content   |
+-----------+---------------+-----------+
| Integer   | Integer       | String    |
+-----------+---------------+-----------+

```

### Problem Statement

**Find the names of users who have sent at least one message.**

### LeetCode Python Solution

Here's the Python code structured for LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def find_usernames_with_messages(self, users: List[Tuple[int, str]], messages: List[Tuple[int, int, str]]) -> List[str]:
        user_set = set()  # To keep track of users who sent messages
        
        # Iterating over messages to populate user_set with user IDs
        for message in messages:
            user_id = message[1]
            user_set.add(user_id)
        
        # Prepare the results list
        results = []
        
        # Loop through users and collect names of those who sent messages
        for user in users:
            user_id, name = user
            if user_id in user_set:
                results.append(name)
                
        return results

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: The class `Solution` encapsulates the method. This is common in LeetCode to ensure your code is well-structured.
  
2. **Function Definition**: The method `find_usernames_with_messages` accepts two lists:
   - `users`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains `user_id` and `name`.
   - `messages`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains `message_id`, `user_id`, and `content`.

3. **Set for User IDs**: A set named `user_set` is used to track users who have sent messages. Using a set allows for O(1) average time complexity for lookups.

4. **Collecting User IDs who Sent Messages**: We loop through the `messages` list to populate the `user_set` with all unique user IDs that appear in this list.

5. **Collecting Results**: We then loop through the `users` list and check which user IDs exist in `user_set`. If they do, we append the corresponding `name` to the results list.

6. **Return the Results**: Finally, the function returns a list of names of users who have sent at least one message.

### Notes:
- Make sure that the input format of your problem matches what is defined (in this case, Python lists of tuples).
- In LeetCode, typically the function signature may slightly differ based on the problem statement; ensure to adjust it according to that.
- The above code assumes a scenario and might need adjustments depending on the exact details of the problem and the schema provided.

If you have a specific problem or schema structure you want to work with, please share it, and I will gladly help you craft a tailored solution!

# 1083. Sales Analysis II

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you’re requesting a Python solution to a problem, but you haven’t provided the specific details of the problem statement or the SQL schema that you want to work with. However, I can describe how to approach solving a problem on LeetCode in Python, along with a general template.

### General Approach to Solving a Problem on LeetCode

1. **Read the Problem Statement:** Understand the requirements and constraints.

2. **Plan the Solution:** Determine the algorithm and data structures you will use.

3. **Write the code in LeetCode format:** Follow the platform's class and method structure.

4. **Test your code:** Make sure to test your solution with provided test cases.

### Example Problem: Two Sum

I'll provide a detailed solution for a well-known problem called "Two Sum" to illustrate the required format.

#### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#### SQL Schema

(Since there was no specific SQL schema mentioned, we will skip this.)

#### Example Input/Output

- Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
- Output: `[0,1]` (because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`)

### Python Solution in LeetCode Format



```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = {}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], index]
            num_to_index[num] = index
        return []  # This should never be hit since we assume exactly one solution exists

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** 
   - We initialize a dictionary `num_to_index` to store numbers and their corresponding indices from the `nums` array.

2. **Iterate through nums:** 
   - Using a loop, we check each number in `nums` using `enumerate`, which gives both the `index` and the `num`.

3. **Calculate Complement:** 
   - For each `num`, we compute its `complement` by subtracting it from the `target`.

4. **Check for Complement:** 
   - We check if the complement exists in `num_to_index`. If it does, we found a solution and return the indices.

5. **Store the Index:** 
   - If the complement isn't found, we store the current number along with its index in the dictionary.

6. **Return Statement:** 
   - Although the return statement for an empty list is added, it is theoretically unreachable, as per problem constraints (there is always one solution).

### Testing

You can run this function against various test cases on the LeetCode platform to ensure correctness. Here are some examples of how you can test it:



```python
# Test cases
assert Solution().twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1]
assert Solution().twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) == [1, 2]
assert Solution().twoSum([3, 3], 6) == [0, 1]

```

### Conclusion

This is a standard approach to coding challenges on LeetCode. You can apply the same structured methodology to different problems, adapting the logic and implementation accordingly. If you provide the specific problem statement and SQL schema, I can assist you in formulating a precise solution for that case.

# 1084. Sales Analysis III

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! While I can't directly see the SQL schema you're referring to, I can guide you on how to format your Python code based on common LeetCode problem structures. Typically, LeetCode problems specify an input format, expected output, and some constraints.

Let’s assume you have a typical LeetCode problem format around SQL and we'll handle it as a typical data processing scenario.

For this example, let’s consider the problem statement: "Write a SQL query to find all employees who earn more than the average salary."

Here’s how to solve this problem using Python, assuming you are familiar with the necessary database management system to execute SQL queries.

### Approach:
1. **Calculate the average salary**: First, we need to compute the average salary from the Employees table.
2. **Find all employees earning more than the average**: After calculating the average, select all employees whose salary is greater than the average.

### SQL Schema
Assuming the table structure is like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Salary INT
);

```

### SQL Query

```
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);

```

### Python Code
To implement and run this SQL command on a common LeetCode platform using Python, you would typically use an ORM or a database connection library. Here’s how it might look using a mock function assuming we are writing a solution class:



```python
class Solution:
    def highest_paid_employees(self, db_connection):
        """
        This function takes a database connection and retrieves the names of all employees
        whose salary is greater than the average salary.
        :param db_connection: a connection object to the database
        :return: List of employee names
        """
        query = """
        SELECT Name
        FROM Employees
        WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
        """
        
        # Assuming we have a method that executes SQL and returns results
        cursor = db_connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()  # Fetch all results
        
        # Extract the names from the results
        employee_names = [row[0] for row in results]  # Assuming the first column is the name
        return employee_names

# Note: You would typically not include db_connection in LeetCode as they manage the database for you.

```

### Explanation:
- **Class Definition**: The SQL solution is wrapped in a class named `Solution`—common practice in LeetCode problems.
- **Method Definition**: The method `highest_paid_employees` simulates the retrieval of employee names from a database.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query is defined as a multi-line string. It calculates the average salary and compares it to each employee's salary.
- **Cursor**: We assume `db_connection` is an object with a method `cursor()` that helps to interact with the database directly. 
- **Execution & Fetching**: The query is executed, and results are fetched.
- **Data Extraction**: The employee names are extracted from the results, which are typically returned as tuples.

### Note:
In a real LeetCode Code Execution environment:
- LeetCode manages the database interactions, so the SQL statements are often provided in the question itself, and you may need to write the SQL directly rather than embedding it in Python code.
- This code serves as a template; you may need to adjust it according to the exact task and input/output requirements of the LeetCode problem you face.

By following the above structure, you can successfully write a Python solution for a problem that involves SQL queries in the LeetCode format. Let me know if you have a specific SQL or coding problem in mind!

# 1097. Game Play Analysis V

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems you've referred to a problem concerning an SQL schema but did not provide the specific problem statement. To assist you effectively, I need the details of the problem you'd like help with, including any tables and the type of result you're looking for.

However, based on the context of LeetCode, SQL problems usually require a specific query to retrieve or manipulate data. 

Here's a general approach to writing a solution for such problems in the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def someFunction(self, params):
        # Your main logic here
        return result

```

### Explanation of a Typical Approach:
1. **Class Definition**: The class name is typically `Solution` which is required by LeetCode.
2. **Method Definition**: Implement a method (like `someFunction`) that follows the method signature that LeetCode specifies.
3. **Logic Implementation**: Write your logic inside this method. This is where you would typically handle the data, perform calculations, and prepare any results.
4. **Return Statement**: Finally, return the required output.

### Example Problem Walkthrough (Hypothetical):
Let’s say we need to find the names of all employees whose salary is greater than a certain value from a given `Employees` table. 

#### Sample Schema:
Assume the Employees table schema:


```
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary INT
);

```

#### Sample Problem Statement:
"Write a SQL query to find the names of employees with a salary greater than 100,000."

### SQL Solution:
The corresponding SQL query would look like this:


```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Employees 
WHERE salary > 100000;

```

### Python Solution:
If you were asked to implement this within a Python function (although generally, this type of problem would be SQL-focused in LeetCode):



```python
class Solution:
    def getEmployeesWithHighSalary(self, salaries):
        # Assuming salaries is a list of tuples representing (id, name, salary)
        result = []
        
        for emp in salaries:
            id, name, salary = emp
            if salary > 100000:
                result.append(name)
        
        return result

```

### Explanation of Python Code:
1. **Class Definition**: A class `Solution` is created.
2. **Function Definition**: A method `getEmployeesWithHighSalary` accepts a list of salary data (often provided differently in easier problems on LeetCode).
3. **Logic**: The method iterates through provided employee data, checks the condition (salary > 100,000) and appends matching employee names into the result list.
4. **Return**: The names are returned as the output.

### Conclusion
This framework provides a solid outline for converting SQL problems to Python or crafting an appropriate SQL solution. Please provide the specific problem details for more tailored assistance.

# 1098. Unpopular Books

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that your question is incomplete, and you didn't provide the details of the problem statement regarding the SQL schema you mentioned. However, I can provide you with an example of how to solve a problem using Python on LeetCode format.

Let's assume you're asking for a common SQL-related problem like processing a table with employee data. Here's how a typical SQL-based problem and its solution in Python would look like:

### Problem Example:
Given a table `Employee` with the following structure:


```
+-------------+---------+------------+
| employee_id | name    | salary     |
+-------------+---------+------------+
| 1           | John    | 70000      |
| 2           | Jane    | 80000      |
| 3           | Bob     | 60000      |
| 4           | Alice   | 85000      |
| 5           | Tom     | 55000      |
+-------------+---------+------------+

```

Write a query to find the `name` of all employees with the `salary` greater than `60000`.

### SQL Solution:
The SQL query for the above statement would be:

```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary > 60000;

```

### Python Solution Format:
Since LeetCode problems often require Python function implementations, let me illustrate how we could implement a similar logic using a Python function. For this example, we assume that the data is provided to our function in the form of a list of dictionaries.

Here's how you can build the solution:



```python
from typing import List, Dict

class Solution:
    def highSalaryEmployees(self, employees: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> List[str]:
        """
        This function takes a list of employee dictionaries and returns
        the names of employees with a salary greater than 60000.
        
        :param employees: List of dictionaries containing employee data.
        :return: List of names of employees with salary > 60000.
        """
        result = []
        
        for employee in employees:
            if employee['salary'] > 60000:
                result.append(employee['name'])
        
        return result

```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: We define a method `highSalaryEmployees` that takes a list of employees, where each employee is represented as a dictionary containing keys like `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`.
  
2. **Loop Through Employees**: We iterate through each employee in the list. 

3. **Salary Check**: For each employee, we check if their salary is greater than `60000`.

4. **Collecting Results**: If the condition is met, we append the employee's name to the `result` list.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list of names that meet the criteria.

### Using the Solution:
You may use the solution like this:



```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    employees_data = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "John", "salary": 70000},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Jane", "salary": 80000},
        {"employee_id": 3, "name": "Bob", "salary": 60000},
        {"employee_id": 4, "name": "Alice", "salary": 85000},
        {"employee_id": 5, "name": "Tom", "salary": 55000},
    ]
    print(solution.highSalaryEmployees(employees_data))

```

### Output:
This would output:

```
['John', 'Jane', 'Alice']

```

# 1103. Distribute Candies to People

### Problem Description 
We distribute some number of `candies`, to a row of `n = num_people` people in the following way:
We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give `n` candies to the last person.

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving `n + 1` candies to the first person, `n + 2` candies to the second person, and so on until we give `2 * n` candies to the last person.

This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).

Return an array (of length `num_people` and sum `candies`) that represents the final distribution of candies.


Example 1:
Input: candies = 7, num_people = 4
Output: [1,2,3,1]
Explanation:
On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0,0].

On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0,0].

On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3,0].

On the fourth turn, ans[3] += 1 (because there is only one candy left), and the final array is [1,2,3,1].


Example 2:
Input: candies = 10, num_people = 3
Output: [5,2,3]
Explanation: 
On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0].

On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0].

On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3].

On the fourth turn, ans[0] += 4, and the final array is [5,2,3].


Constraints:
1 <= candies <= 10^9
1 <= num_people <= 1000

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of distributing candies among people as described, we can formulate a solution that simulates the distribution process step by step. However, considering potential constraints and the necessity of efficiency (since `candies` can be as high as `10^9`), we can derive a mathematical formula to compute the distribution without performing excessive iterations.

### Breakdown of the Distribution Process

1. **Initialization**:
   We start with an array `ans` of size `num_people`, initialized to zero, to hold the total candies given to each person.

2. **Full Rounds Calculation**:
   Each full round of distribution gives `n * (n + 1) / 2` candies (from the sequence: 1, 2, ..., n). Define:
   - `total_candies_in_full_round = n * (n + 1) / 2`
   - `full_rounds = candies // total_candies_in_full_round`
   
   This tells us how many complete rounds we can perform given the total candies.

3. **Distribute Full Rounds**:
   For each person, they will receive:
   
``` 
   ans[i] += full_rounds * (i + 1)
   
```
   This is because each person `i` gets `i + 1` candies per round, multiplied by the number of complete rounds.

4. **Remaining Candies**:
   After distributing the candies in full rounds, we compute any remaining candies:
   
```
   remaining_candies = candies - (full_rounds * total_candies_in_full_round)
   
```

5. **Distributing Remaining Candies**:
   We then distribute any remaining candies. This is done in a loop starting from the first person to the last, going back to the first if needed:
   - For each person, we give them candies in the order until we run out of remaining candies.

### Python Code Implementation

Here is the complete code implementation that adheres to the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, candies: int, num_people: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the answer array
        ans = [0] * num_people
        
        # Total number of candies in one full round
        total_candies_in_full_round = (num_people * (num_people + 1)) // 2
        
        # Count how many full rounds can be completed
        full_rounds = candies // total_candies_in_full_round
        
        # Distribute candies for full rounds
        for i in range(num_people):
            ans[i] += full_rounds * (i + 1)
        
        # Calculate remaining candies after full rounds
        remaining_candies = candies - (full_rounds * total_candies_in_full_round)
        
        # Distribute the remaining candies
        i = 0
        while remaining_candies > 0:
            # The number of candies to give to person i
            candies_to_give = i + 1
            
            # If there are enough remaining candies, give them; otherwise, give remaining candies only
            if remaining_candies >= candies_to_give:
                ans[i] += candies_to_give
                remaining_candies -= candies_to_give
            else:
                ans[i] += remaining_candies
                break
            
            # Move to the next person
            i += 1
            # Wrap around if we exceed the number of people
            if i == num_people:
                i = 0
                
        return ans

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- First, we initialize the result array `ans`.
- We calculate how many full rounds of distribution can be made given the number of candies and how many candies are distributed in each round.
- We then update the `ans` array based on these full rounds.
- For any remaining candies, we distribute them one by one until none are left. Each distribution respects the potential wrap-around behavior for cyclic processing of the array.
- Finally, we return the `ans` array containing the finalized candy distribution.

This approach efficiently calculates the distribution in O(n) time complexity while handling very large values of candies, adhering to LeetCode's requirements.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete as I only see a mention of "SQL Schema" but no specific problem is provided to solve. LeetCode typically has problems that involve SQL queries or other types of problems. 

I can provide a template based on a common SQL problem scenario to demonstrate how you can structure a solution. If you can clarify the exact problem you would like to solve, that would be great.

Here's a template based on a hypothetical SQL problem that you might encounter on LeetCode:

### Problem Example:

Suppose we have two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`, structured as follows:

**Employees Table**:
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar  |
| departmentId| int     |

**Departments Table**:
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar  |

Write a SQL query to find the name of the department that has the highest number of employees. If there are multiple departments with the same number of employees, return any one of them.

### Expected Output:
| department |
|------------|
| Sales      |

### SQL Solution:

Here is how you can solve it using SQL on LeetCode:


```sql
SELECT d.name AS department
FROM Departments d
JOIN Employees e ON d.id = e.departmentId
GROUP BY d.name
ORDER BY COUNT(e.id) DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

### Explanation:

1. **JOIN Operation**: We use an `INNER JOIN` between `Departments` and `Employees` on the department ID to combine data from both tables, enabling us to count the number of employees in each department.

2. **GROUP BY**: We group the results by department name to aggregate employee counts.

3. **COUNT**: We use `COUNT(e.id)` to count the number of employees for each department.

4. **ORDER BY**: We order the results by the count of employees in descending order so that the department with the most employees comes first.

5. **LIMIT**: We limit the results to 1 to fetch only the top department.

### Run Directly on LeetCode:
You can copy and paste the SQL code into the SQL editor provided by LeetCode for this specific problem while keeping in mind other constraints specific to the question when implementing it.

### Conclusion:
Feel free to provide the exact details of the problem you would like to solve, and I can offer a more tailored solution and explanation!

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! It looks like you're asking for a solution to a problem that revolves around SQL schemas, but your request is somewhat incomplete. However, I'll provide a Python solution based on a common type of problem related to SQL schemas, specifically that found in many LeetCode problems, such as joining tables or performing aggregations.

### Example Problem: "Employee Importance"

Consider a problem where we have two tables: `Employee` and `EmployeeImportance`, and we need to find the total importance of an employee by summing up their own importance and the importance of their subordinates.

Here's how those tables might look:

**Employee Table:**

```
+----+-------+------------+
| id | name  | importance |
+----+-------+------------+
| 1  | John  | 5          |
| 2  | Doe   | 3          |
| 3  | Jane  | 1          |
+----+-------+------------+

```

**Subordinates Table:**

```
+-----------+-----------+
| employee_id | subordinate_id |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 1         | 3         |
+-----------+-----------+

```

### Task

Given the ID of an employee, find the employee's total importance score, which is the importance of the employee plus the importance scores of all their direct and indirect subordinates.

### Solution

Here’s how you can solve this problem using Python. The solution reads employee and subordinate data and computes total importance recursively.



```python
# Definition for the Employee.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id: int, importance: int, subordinates: List[int]):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.subordinates = subordinates

class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees: List[Employee], id: int) -> int:
        # Create a dictionary to facilitate quick lookups
        emp_dict = {employee.id: employee for employee in employees}
        
        def dfs(emp_id):
            # Get the employee by ID
            employee = emp_dict[emp_id]
            total_importance = employee.importance
            
            # Recursively calculate the importance of subordinates
            for sub_id in employee.subordinates:
                total_importance += dfs(sub_id)
            return total_importance
        
        # Start the DFS from the employee with the given ID
        return dfs(id)

```

### Explanation

1. **Employee Class**: The `Employee` class is defined to represent each employee with attributes for `id`, `importance`, and `subordinates`.

2. **Dictionary for Fast Lookup**: In `getImportance()`, we create a dictionary called `emp_dict` that maps each employee's ID to their corresponding `Employee` object for quick access.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The `dfs` function is defined to calculate the total importance recursively.
   - It accepts an employee ID, retrieves the employee from the dictionary, and initializes the total importance score with the employee's importance.
   - It then iterates over the employee's subordinates, calling `dfs` for each subordinate to sum their importance to the total.

4. **Starting Point**: The method is called with the given `id` to calculate the importance starting from that employee.

5. **Running the Code**: You can directly run this code on LeetCode after creating Employee instances and passing a list of employees to the `getImportance()` method along with the target employee ID.

### Conclusion
This Python solution effectively demonstrates a common approach to problems involving trees and graphs (in this case, an organizational structure) using recursion. The use of a dictionary enables the efficient lookup of employee details, ensuring that the solution works seamlessly in practical scenarios like those posed by SQL data structures in programming challenges.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems there might be a misunderstanding, as the problem you've mentioned appears to relate to an SQL Schema, but you've asked for a Python solution that follows the LeetCode format. LeetCode typically features algorithm or coding problems which require a solution to be implemented in programming languages like Python.

If you intended to provide a specific problem related to an SQL schema or a particular coding problem you'd like to solve using Python, please clarify that.

However, I'll provide a Python solution format that is applicable for LeetCode-like problems, which includes problem description, example inputs, and a corresponding Python code that could hypothetically apply depending on the problem context. 

I'll create a sample problem related to SQL schema for demonstration purposes. Let's assume we have a problem that summarizes some user data, which can be solved programmatically.

### Sample Problem Statement

**Problem:**
You are given a table `Users` with the following columns:
- `user_id` (INT): the id of the user
- `first_name` (VARCHAR): the first name of the user
- `last_name` (VARCHAR): the last name of the user
- `age` (INT): the age of the user

You need to write a Python function that returns the user's full name for each user who is older than 18 years old concatenated as "FirstName LastName".

**Function Signature:**


```python
def get_full_names(users: List[Dict[str, Union[int, str]]]) -> List[str]:

```

**Example:**

``` 
Input:
users = [
    {"user_id": 1, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "age": 20},
    {"user_id": 2, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Smith", "age": 17},
    {"user_id": 3, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Parker", "age": 22}
]

Output:
["John Doe", "Peter Parker"]

```

### Python Code Solution

Here is the solution in Python which adheres to the LeetCode format:



```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union

def get_full_names(users: List[Dict[str, Union[int, str]]]) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    
    for user in users:
        if user["age"] > 18:  # Check if the user is older than 18
            full_name = f"{user['first_name']} {user['last_name']}"  # Concatenate first and last name
            result.append(full_name)  # Add to results

    return result

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    users = [
        {"user_id": 1, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "age": 20},
        {"user_id": 2, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Smith", "age": 17},
        {"user_id": 3, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Parker", "age": 22}
    ]
    
    print(get_full_names(users))  # Output: ["John Doe", "Peter Parker"]

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**: We define our function `get_full_names` that accepts a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a user.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` that will hold the full names of users older than 18.

3. **Loop through Users**: We iterate through each user in the input list:
   - We check if the user’s age is greater than 18.
   - If true, we concatenate the first and last name using an f-string for clarity and then append the result to the `result` list.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the `result` list containing all qualified users' full names.

5. **Example Usage**: The sample main block shows how to call this function and print the results.

This code can be tested on platforms like LeetCode once it is adapted to meet the problem statement which you'd want to implement. If you have a specific SQL-based problem or another coding problem in mind, please provide details!

# 1114. Print in Order

### Problem Description 
Suppose we have a class:
public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of `Foo` will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call `first()`, thread B will call `second()`, and thread C will call `third()`. Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that `second()` is executed after `first()`, and `third()` is executed after `second()`.


Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.


Example 2:
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Note:
We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the numbers in the input seems to imply the ordering. The input format you see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of controlling the order of method execution across multiple threads in Python, we can use threading and synchronization primitives from the `threading` module. We'll implement a class `Foo` that ensures the methods `first`, `second`, and `third` are called in order, regardless of how the threads are scheduled.

Here is the plan:
1. We will use `threading.Condition` which allows threads to wait for certain conditions to be met before proceeding.
2. We will implement a mechanism where the first thread (A) must complete its task before the second thread (B) can proceed, and similarly, the second must complete before the third (C) can proceed.

### Step-by-Step Code Explanation

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Foo` with three methods: `first`, `second`, and `third`.
2. **Condition Variables**: We create a `Condition` object and several flags to track which methods can execute.
3. **Thread Methods**:
   - The `first` method will notify that it has completed.
   - The `second` method will wait until `first` is done and then notify that it is complete.
   - The `third` method will wait until `second` is done.

Here's the implementation:



```python
import threading

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.condition = threading.Condition()
        self.order = 0  # This will track the order of the method completion

    def first(self):
        with self.condition:
            print("first", end="")
            self.order = 1  # Indicate that first has run
            self.condition.notify_all()  # Notify all waiting threads

    def second(self):
        with self.condition:
            # Wait until first() is finished
            while self.order < 1:
                self.condition.wait()
            print("second", end="")
            self.order = 2  # Indicate that second has run
            self.condition.notify_all()  # Notify other threads

    def third(self):
        with self.condition:
            # Wait until second() is finished
            while self.order < 2:
                self.condition.wait()
            print("third", end="")

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- The `order` variable is used to keep track of whether `first`, `second`, or `third` has been executed.
- In the `first` method, we set `order` to 1 after printing "first" and notify all waiting threads.
- In the `second` method, we use a while loop to check if `first` has completed (i.e., `order` is at least 1). If not, it waits.
- In the `third` method, we again check if `second` has been completed before proceeding.

### Example Usage for Testing:

To test our `Foo` class with threads, we would initialize the class and create the threads as follows:



```python
def run_threads(input_order):
    foo = Foo()
    
    def thread_first():
        foo.first()
    
    def thread_second():
        foo.second()
    
    def thread_third():
        foo.third()
    
    threads = []
    for num in input_order:
        if num == 1:
            threads.append(threading.Thread(target=thread_first))
        elif num == 2:
            threads.append(threading.Thread(target=thread_second))
        elif num == 3:
            threads.append(threading.Thread(target=thread_third))

    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

# Example test cases
run_threads([1, 2, 3])  # Should print "firstsecondthird"
run_threads([1, 3, 2])  # Should still print "firstsecondthird"

```

### Important Notes:
- The output is done using `print()` directly from the methods, and we use `end=""` to prevent newlines from splitting our output.
- Ensure that threads are joined after starting them to ensure the main program waits for all threads to finish execution. 

This solution adheres to LeetCode's requirements and ensures that the output remains in the correct order regardless of the order in which the threads were started.

# 1115. Print FooBar Alternately

### Problem Description 
Suppose you are given the following code:
class FooBar {
  public void foo() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("foo");
    }
  }
  public void bar() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("bar");
    }
  }
}
The same instance of `FooBar` will be passed to two different threads. Thread A will call `foo()` while thread B will call `bar()`. Modify the given program to output "foobar" n times.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: "foobar"
Explanation: There are two threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls foo(), while the other calls bar(). "foobar" is being output 1 time.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: "foobarfoobar"
Explanation: "foobar" is being output 2 times.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of printing "foobar" n times using two threads in Python, we can utilize threading and a locking mechanism to synchronize the execution of the `foo()` and `bar()` methods. The key idea is that thread A should execute the `foo()` method and then thread B should execute the `bar()` method, ensuring that the output alternates correctly to produce "foobar" n times.

Here’s how we can implement the solution:

1. We will create a class `FooBar` which takes an integer `n` as the input. This `n` denotes how many times "foobar" will be printed.
2. Inside the class, we'll use threading for concurrency. We will have two methods: `foo()` and `bar()` that correspond to the described operations.
3. We will use a threading lock to control the order of execution. The `foo()` method will only proceed when allowed, and the same will be true for the `bar()` method.
4. The initial condition is set so that `bar()` cannot run until `foo()` has completed its operation for each respective cycle of "foobar".
5. By utilizing locking and signaling mechanisms, each thread will be able to execute its function in the required order.

Let's implement this solution step-by-step in Python:



```python
import threading

class FooBar:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.n = n
        self.lock_foo = threading.Lock()
        self.lock_bar = threading.Lock()
        
        # Initially allow foo to execute first
        self.lock_foo.acquire()
        self.lock_bar.acquire()

    def foo(self):
        for _ in range(self.n):
            # When foo is called, it should print "foo"
            print("foo", end='')
            # Allow bar to execute
            self.lock_bar.release()
            # Wait for bar to finish before executing foo again
            self.lock_foo.acquire()

    def bar(self):
        for _ in range(self.n):
            # Wait for foo to complete
            self.lock_bar.acquire()
            # When bar is called, it should print "bar"
            print("bar", end='')
            # Allow foo to execute again
            self.lock_foo.release()

# To test the solution, we can use the following as the main program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 2  # Example input; you can change this for testing
    foobar = FooBar(n)
    
    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=foobar.foo)
    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=foobar.bar)
    
    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()
    
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: In the `__init__` method, we initialize the instance variable `n` which represents how many times "foobar" should be printed. We also create two locks: `lock_foo` and `lock_bar`. The `foo()` method is initially allowed to run (hence `lock_bar` starts as acquired).

2. **foo Method**:
   - This method will print "foo" n times. After every print, it releases the `lock_bar`, allowing the `bar()` method to execute. It then acquires the `lock_foo` again, which makes it wait for the next call from `bar()`.

3. **bar Method**:
   - Similar to `foo`, it prints "bar" n times, but it starts by acquiring the `lock_bar` to ensure it waits for the `foo()` method to release it. It releases the `lock_foo` to allow `foo()` to execute again.

4. **Thread Creation**: We create two threads, one for each of the `foo()` and `bar()` methods, and start them. Finally, we join the threads to ensure the main thread waits for both to complete in case you'd like to encapsulate the execution cleanly.

With this setup, the output "foobar" will be printed `n` times in the correct order, showing how synchronization across two threads can achieve the desired output.

# 1116. Print Zero Even Odd

### Problem Description 
Suppose you are given the following code:
class ZeroEvenOdd {
  public ZeroEvenOdd(int n) { ... }      // constructor
  public void zero(printNumber) { ... }  // only output 0's
  public void even(printNumber) { ... }  // only output even numbers
  public void odd(printNumber) { ... }   // only output odd numbers
}
The same instance of `ZeroEvenOdd` will be passed to three different threads:
Thread A will call `zero()` which should only output 0's.

Thread B will call `even()` which should only ouput even numbers.

Thread C will call `odd()` which should only output odd numbers.

Each of the threads is given a `printNumber` method to output an integer. Modify the given program to output the series `010203040506`... where the length of the series must be 2n.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: "0102"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls zero(), the other calls even(), and the last one calls odd(). "0102" is the correct output.


Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: "0102030405"

### Solution 
 To solve the problem where we need to output a series of numbers alternating between zeroes, even numbers, and odd numbers using multiple threads in Python, we can employ the `threading` module along with threading primitives like `Condition`. This will help us synchronize the threads to ensure that they print the output in the correct order.

Here’s the explanation of how the solution works and the code implementation:

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Class Definition**: We will define a class `ZeroEvenOdd` that initializes with an integer `n`. This integer represents the maximum number we need to print, where the output will be structured as `010203...` up to `n`.

2. **Threading Conditions**: We will use a `Condition` object to manage the state and the order of the output messages among the three threads:
   - `zero_lock`: Controls when the zero thread can print.
   - `even_lock`: Controls when the even thread can print.
   - `odd_lock`: Controls when the odd thread can print.

3. **Zero, Even, Odd Functions**: Each function will check the current number to be printed:
   - The `zero` function will print `0` and notify the next thread (either odd or even) to print.
   - The `odd` function will print the odd numbers and notify `zero` to print `0` again.
   - The `even` function works similarly for even numbers.

4. **Thread Initialization**: We will create three threads for `zero`, `even`, and `odd` functions and start them.

5. **Join Threads**: After starting the threads, we will wait for all threads to finish their execution using the `join` method.

Now, here’s the implementation of the solution:

## Python Code



```python
import threading

class ZeroEvenOdd:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.n = n
        self.current = 0
        self.condition = threading.Condition()

    def zero(self, printNumber: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for _ in range(self.n):
            with self.condition:
                # Wait until it's the zero's turn
                while self.current != 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                printNumber()  # Print zero
                self.current += 1  # Signal that zero has been printed
                # Notify the next thread which is odd or even based on current
                self.condition.notify_all()
    
    def odd(self, printNumber: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for i in range(1, self.n + 1, 2):
            with self.condition:
                # Wait until it's the odd's turn
                while self.current < 1 or self.current % 2 == 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                printNumber(i)  # Print odd number
                self.current += 1  # Signal that odd number has been printed
                self.condition.notify_all()
    
    def even(self, printNumber: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for i in range(2, self.n + 1, 2):
            with self.condition:
                # Wait until it's the even's turn
                while self.current < 1 or self.current % 2 == 1:
                    self.condition.wait()
                printNumber(i)  # Print even number
                self.current += 1  # Signal that even number has been printed
                self.condition.notify_all()

# Example usage:
# def printNumber(num):
#     print(num, end="")
# zero_even_odd = ZeroEvenOdd(2)
# t1 = threading.Thread(target=zero_even_odd.zero, args=(lambda: printNumber(0),))
# t2 = threading.Thread(target=zero_even_odd.even, args=(printNumber,))
# t3 = threading.Thread(target=zero_even_odd.odd, args=(printNumber,))
# t1.start()
# t2.start()
# t3.start()
# t1.join()
# t2.join()
# t3.join()

```

### Running in LeetCode Format

You can copy and paste the above code directly into LeetCode as a solution to the problem. Note that you may need to adapt the `printNumber` logic to fit any specific print requirements that LeetCode might enforce.

# 1117. Building H2O

### Problem Description 
There are two kinds of threads, `oxygen` and `hydrogen`. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given `releaseHydrogen` and `releaseOxygen` methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:
If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.

If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.


Example 1:
Input: "HOH"
Output: "HHO"
Explanation: "HOH" and "OHH" are also valid answers.


Example 2:
Input: "OOHHHH"
Output: "HHOHHO"
Explanation: "HOHHHO", "OHHHHO", "HHOHOH", "HOHHOH", "OHHHOH", "HHOOHH", "HOHOHH" and "OHHOHH" are also valid answers.


Constraints:
Total length of input string will be 3n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

Total number of `H` will be 2n in the input string.

Total number of `O` will be n in the input string.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of synchronizing threads of oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) to form water (H2O) molecules, we need to ensure that every time a group of threads passes through the barrier, it consists of exactly 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen thread. We will utilize Python's threading and synchronization mechanisms to implement this.

Here's a detailed explanation of the approach we'll take, followed by the complete code that can be executed directly on LeetCode.

### Explanation:

1. **Thread Synchronization**:
   - We will use Python's `threading` module, particularly `Semaphore` to manage the counts of hydrogen and oxygen threads that can proceed through the barrier.
   - We will maintain a count of hydrogen and oxygen threads waiting to pass, ensuring that exactly 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen thread forms a "water" group.

2. **Semaphore Initialization**:
   - Two semaphores will be initialized:
     - `hydrogen_semaphore`: This will allow hydrogen threads to proceed when there are enough threads.
     - `oxygen_semaphore`: This will manage the oxygen threads.

3. **Thread Method Functions**:
   - Each hydrogen thread calls the `releaseHydrogen()` method, while the oxygen thread calls `releaseOxygen()`.
   - Hydrogen threads need to ensure that before they can proceed, at least 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen were released.
   - Oxygen threads need to ensure that they can proceed only if there are 2 hydrogen threads available.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - For hydrogen, it must wait if there aren't two hydrogen along with one oxygen ready to proceed.
   - For oxygen, it must also wait if there aren’t sufficient hydrogen threads available to form a water molecule.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - We'll maintain a list that will store the outputs in the order they are released as either 'H' or 'O'.
   - Finally, concatenate the results to return a single string that represents the formed water molecule groups.

### Python Code:



```python
import threading

class H2O:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hydrogen_count = 0
        self.oxygen_count = 0
        self.hydrogen_semaphore = threading.Semaphore(0)
        self.oxygen_semaphore = threading.Semaphore(0)
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def releaseHydrogen(self, releaseHydrogen):
        with self.lock:
            self.hydrogen_count += 1
            # If two hydrogen are present and one oxygen, release them
            if self.hydrogen_count == 2 and self.oxygen_count == 1:
                self.hydrogen_semaphore.release(2)  # Release 2 hydrogen
                self.oxygen_semaphore.release(1)     # Release 1 oxygen
                self.hydrogen_count = 0
                self.oxygen_count = 0
        
        self.hydrogen_semaphore.acquire()  # Wait to proceed
        releaseHydrogen()  # release the hydrogen

    def releaseOxygen(self, releaseOxygen):
        with self.lock:
            self.oxygen_count += 1
            # If two hydrogen are present and one oxygen, release them
            if self.hydrogen_count == 2 and self.oxygen_count == 1:
                self.hydrogen_semaphore.release(2)  # Release 2 hydrogen
                self.oxygen_semaphore.release(1)     # Release 1 oxygen
                self.hydrogen_count = 0
                self.oxygen_count = 0
        
        self.oxygen_semaphore.acquire()  # Wait to proceed
        releaseOxygen()  # release the oxygen

```

### How it Works:
1. When hydrogen threads invoke `releaseHydrogen()`, they increment their count. If there are exactly 2 hydrogen threads along with an available oxygen thread, the appropriate semaphores are released and reset the counters.
2. The `releaseOxygen()` method functions similarly but checks for the presence of hydrogen threads before proceeding.
3. The use of a lock ensures that the checks and increments of counts are atomic operations, preventing race conditions.
4. Each thread waits for its signal via the semaphore to ensure they group correctly before proceeding.

This solution effectively enforces the constraints of the problem while correctly coordinating the flow of hydrogen and oxygen threads to form water molecules.

# 1118. Number of Days in a Month

### Problem Description 
Given a year `Y` and a month `M`, return how many days there are in that month.


Example 1:
Input: Y = 1992, M = 7
Output: 31

Example 2:
Input: Y = 2000, M = 2
Output: 29

Example 3:
Input: Y = 1900, M = 2
Output: 28
Note:
`1583 <= Y <= 2100`
`1 <= M <= 12`

### Solution 
 Certainly! To solve the problem of determining how many days are in a given month of a specific year, we can use the following approach:

### Explanation
1. **Understanding the Months**:
   - Each month has a specific number of days. Most months have either 30 or 31 days, except February, which has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year.

2. **Leap Year Calculation**:
   - A year is considered a leap year if:
     - It is divisible by 4.
     - It is not divisible by 100, except if it is also divisible by 400.
   - This means:
     - The year 2000 is a leap year (divisible by 400).
     - The year 1900 is not a leap year (divisible by 100 but not by 400).
     - The year 2020 is a leap year (divisible by 4 but not by 100).

3. **Days in Each Month**:
   - The number of days in each month is as follows:
     - January: 31
     - February: 28 (29 if leap year)
     - March: 31
     - April: 30
     - May: 31
     - June: 30
     - July: 31
     - August: 31
     - September: 30
     - October: 31
     - November: 30
     - December: 31

### Implementation
We will define a function that takes the year `Y` and month `M` as inputs and returns the number of days in that month.

### Python Code



```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfDays(self, Y: int, M: int) -> int:
        # Days in the month for non-leap years
        days_in_month = [0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
        
        # Check for leap year if February
        if M == 2:
            if (Y % 4 == 0 and Y % 100 != 0) or (Y % 400 == 0):
                return 29
            
        # Return days in the month for non-leap years
        return days_in_month[M]

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.numberOfDays(1992, 7))  # Output: 31
# print(sol.numberOfDays(2000, 2))  # Output: 29
# print(sol.numberOfDays(1900, 2))  # Output: 28

```

### Code Explanation
- We create a list `days_in_month` where the index represents each month (1 to 12).
- For February (when `M == 2`), we check if the year is a leap year using the conditions mentioned. If it is, we return 29 days, else we return 28 days.
- For all other months, we simply return the corresponding value from the `days_in_month` list.

This code adheres to the LeetCode submission format and can be run directly on their platform.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Of course! Since your request appears to involve solving a problem related to SQL schema, I’ll provide a brief explanation to set context. However, since there's no specific problem stated, I'll create a common type of problem found on LeetCode that involves SQL schema. For instance, let’s say we are working with two tables: `Users` and `Orders`, and we're tasked with querying a combined result.

### Problem Statement: 

Assuming we have the following two SQL tables:

1. **Users** (`UserId`, `UserName`)
   
```
   +--------+----------+
   | UserId | UserName |
   +--------+----------+
   |      1 | John     |
   |      2 | Jane     |
   |      3 | Bob      |
   +--------+----------+
   
```

2. **Orders** (`OrderId`, `UserId`, `Amount`)
   
```
   +---------+--------+--------+
   | OrderId | UserId | Amount |
   +---------+--------+--------+
   |       1 |      1 |   300  |
   |       2 |      1 |   150  |
   |       3 |      2 |   450  |
   +---------+--------+--------+
   
```

### Task:
Write a SQL query to find all users and the total amount they've spent on orders. If a user has not spent any money, they should still be included in the result with a total amount of 0.

### SQL Query:
Here’s how you can compose the SQL query to achieve this:


```sql
SELECT 
    u.UserId AS UserId,
    UserName,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.Amount), 0) AS TotalAmount
FROM 
    Users u
LEFT JOIN 
    Orders o ON u.UserId = o.UserId
GROUP BY 
    u.UserId, UserName

```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We specify the columns we want in the output. We use `u.UserId` and `UserName` from the `Users` table. The `COALESCE` function is used to return 0 if the sum of amounts is `NULL` (i.e., if a user has no orders).
   
2. **FROM Clause**: This specifies the primary table (`Users`), aliased as `u`.

3. **LEFT JOIN Clause**: We join the `Orders` table (aliased as `o`) to the `Users` table on `UserId`. The LEFT JOIN ensures that even users without any associated orders are included in the results.

4. **GROUP BY Clause**: We group the results by `u.UserId` and `UserName` to compute the total amount for each user effectively.

### Running on LeetCode:
You can simply implement this SQL query in the LeetCode UI where SQL queries are accepted. If SQL problems are part of a coding challenge or report, this query would often be encapsulated within a provided function or framework in the system. 

This is how you'd outline a typical SQL problem in the style of LeetCode. If you need assistance with a specific coding problem or another programming language, please provide more details!

# 1132. Reported Posts II

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that you referred to an SQL schema but did not provide the details of the problem you want addressed in Python. I will proceed with a generic solution format based on a notable problem commonly found in coding platforms like LeetCode.

Let’s assume that you are asking for a typical problem related to SQL schema, like retrieving a specific dataset from these tables using a specific condition or doing a transformation.

### Problem Example: Find Employees with the Highest Salaries

Let's create an example problem to work with. 

**Problem Statement:**

You have a table `Employee` defined by the following schema:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Salary INT
);

```

Write a Python function `highest_salary_employee()` that returns the name(s) of the employee(s) with the highest salary.

### Solution Format for LeetCode

Let's write the solution in Python. In LeetCode, you typically place the logic inside a function. Below is the detailed code:



```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id, name, salary):
        self.Id = id
        self.Name = name
        self.Salary = salary

def highest_salary_employee(employees):
    if not employees:
        return []
    
    max_salary = float('-inf')
    
    # Find the maximum salary
    for employee in employees:
        if employee.Salary > max_salary:
            max_salary = employee.Salary
    
    # Collect names of employees with the highest salary
    highest_salary_employees = []
    for employee in employees:
        if employee.Salary == max_salary:
            highest_salary_employees.append(employee.Name)
    
    return highest_salary_employees

# Example usage:
employees = [
    Employee(1, "John", 3000),
    Employee(2, "Jane", 4000),
    Employee(3, "Doe", 4000),
]
print(highest_salary_employee(employees))

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Employee Class:** 
   - We first declare a class `Employee` which helps in creating objects for each employee with attributes: `Id`, `Name`, and `Salary`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The `highest_salary_employee()` function takes as input a list of `Employee` instances.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - We check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.

4. **Finding Maximum Salary:**
   - We initialize `max_salary` to negative infinity. 
   - We iterate through the list of employees and update `max_salary` whenever we find a higher salary.

5. **Collecting Employees with Maximum Salary:**
   - We create a list called `highest_salary_employees` where we append the names of all employees whose salary matches `max_salary`.

6. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, we return the list of names of employees earning the highest salary.

### Example Usage:
- The function is tested with a sample list of `Employee` objects, and it prints the names of those employees who have the highest salary. 

You can directly run this code on platforms like LeetCode by defining the Employee class and function accordingly. Note that the SQL part would conceptually translate into the data setup; however, in practice, we used Python for data manipulation directly based on the class representation of the SQL schema.

### Solution 
 It seems that your request was cut off, and the details regarding the specific problem you want to solve are missing, particularly the SQL Schema. However, I'll provide a general structure that you can use to format your solution in Python, as per LeetCode's requirements. Once you provide the problem details and the schema, I can help with a specific solution.

### General Python Template for LeetCode Problems



```python
# Let's assume we're working on a problem related to handling a SQL schema in Python.
# This is a general framework that can be adapted to specific problems.

class Solution:
    def someFunction(self, parameters):
        """
        The method to solve the problem.
        
        :param parameters: Input parameters
        :return: Output result
        """
        
        # TODO: Implement the logic based on the problem statement
        # You can use data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.
        
        result = []  # Or any appropriate structure to store results
        
        # Example processing (replace this with actual logic)
        for param in parameters:
            # Perform operations based on the problem requirements
            result.append(self.process(param))
        
        return result
    
    def process(self, param):
        # Process a single unit of input if necessary
        return param  # Placeholder

# Example of how to use the Solution class
solution = Solution()
output = solution.someFunction(inputData)
print(output)

```

### Detailed Explanation of the Framework

1. **Class Definition**: The solution is encapsulated in a class, typically named `Solution`, as required by LeetCode.

2. **Method Definition**: We define a method, here named `someFunction`, which accepts parameters as per the problem's requirements. You might change its name and parameters based on the specific problem.

3. **Docstring**: The method includes a docstring that describes its purpose, input parameters, and return value. This is essential for clarity.

4. **Logic Implementation**: Inside the method, you would implement the logic necessary to solve the problem. This often involves iterating over input data, manipulating data structures, applying algorithms, and constructing the result.

5. **Helper Methods**: If the solution requires more complex processing, you can define additional helper methods, as seen with the `process` method in the example.

6. **Instantiating the Class**: At the bottom of the code, an instance of the `Solution` class is created, and we demonstrate how to call the method with test data.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! However, it appears you've mentioned a SQL schema for a problem without providing the specific problem statement itself. Let's assume you're looking for guidance on handling a common SQL-related problem, and I’ll create a scenario to illustrate a typical problem and provide a complete Python solution for it that you could use in LeetCode format. 

Let’s consider a common task in SQL which is to retrieve specific data from a table. For instance, say we have a `Sales` table and we want to find the total sales amount per product and only return those products that have sales greater than a certain threshold. 

Here’s how you might structure that problem in a LeetCode format along with an explanation of the Python code.

### Problem Statement
You have a `Sales` table defined as follows:


```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sale_id     | int     |
| product_id  | int     |
| amount      | decimal |
| sale_date   | date    |
+-------------+---------+

```
- `sale_id` is the primary key for this table.
- `product_id` refers to the identifier of the product sold.
- `amount` is the amount of money for that sale.
- `sale_date` is the date of sale.

Write a Python function that retrieves the total sales amount per product and return products with total sales greater than a specified amount.

### Input
- `sales`: List of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the `Sales` table.
- `threshold`: float, the amount above which you want to filter the products.

### Output
A list of product_ids having total sales greater than the specified threshold.

### Example
**Input:**


```python
sales = [
    (1, 1, 100.0, '2022-01-01'),
    (2, 2, 150.0, '2022-01-02'),
    (3, 1, 200.0, '2022-01-03'),
    (4, 3, 250.0, '2022-01-04')
]
threshold = 200.0

```

**Output:**


```python
[1, 3]

```

### Python Code
Below is the Python solution based on the problem:



```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple

def total_sales_above_threshold(sales: List[Tuple[int, int, float, str]], threshold: float) -> List[int]:
    # Dictionary to hold total sales per product_id
    total_sales = defaultdict(float)
    
    # Accumulate sales for each product_id
    for sale_id, product_id, amount, sale_date in sales:
        total_sales[product_id] += amount
    
    # Prepare the result with product_ids having total sales above the threshold
    result = []
    for product_id, total in total_sales.items():
        if total > threshold:
            result.append(product_id)
    
    return result

# Example usage; this code won't execute in a LeetCode environment directly.
sales_data = [
    (1, 1, 100.0, '2022-01-01'),
    (2, 2, 150.0, '2022-01-02'),
    (3, 1, 200.0, '2022-01-03'),
    (4, 3, 250.0, '2022-01-04')
]
threshold_value = 200.0
print(total_sales_above_threshold(sales_data, threshold_value))  # Expected output: [1, 3]

```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a list of tuples which represent the sales records and a threshold for filtering.
2. **Data Accumulation**: It uses a `defaultdict` to easily add the `amount` of each sale to the corresponding `product_id`.
3. **Filtering**: After calculating the total sales for each product, it checks against the threshold and collects qualifying `product_id` values in the result list.
4. **Output**: Finally, it returns the list of `product_id`s that meet the criteria.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently aggregates data and filters the results using simple Python constructs, making it suitable for use in environments where SQL is not available, such as LeetCode's Python submissions. Adjust the input format as necessary based on your specific problem statement.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! It seems like you've mentioned a SQL schema but did not specify the exact problem you'd like to solve. If you could provide the problem statement or the task involving the SQL schema, I would be able to help you write a Python solution for it.

In the meantime, I'll provide a general template and an example task related to SQL using Python, assuming that we are dealing with a dataset from a SQL database. 

For instance, let's say the problem is to retrieve a list of employees along with their department names from a given SQL schema. Here's how we'd go about solving this with Python code.

### Problem:
You have two tables:
1. `Employees` (id, name, department_id)
2. `Departments` (id, name)

Write a function `get_employee_department_names()` that retrieves a list of employee names along with their corresponding department names.

### Python Code



```python
# Let's assume we have the following two tables:
# Employees
# +----+---------+---------------+
# | id | name    | department_id  |
# +----+---------+---------------+
# | 1  | Alice   | 1             |
# | 2  | Bob     | 2             |
# | 3  | Charlie  | 1             |
# +----+---------+---------------+

# Departments
# +----+---------+
# | id | name    |
# +----+---------+
# | 1  | HR      |
# | 2  | Engineering |
# +----+---------+

from typing import List, Tuple

# Assuming we have a database connection set up, let's define the function
def get_employee_department_names() -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    # Connect to the database (this connection code will depend on your setup)
    import sqlite3
    connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')  # Replace with your database file
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Query to join Employees and Departments to get the desired information
    query = '''
    SELECT e.name, d.name
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
    '''
    
    cursor.execute(query)
    
    # Fetch all results
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Close the connection
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

    return results  # returns a list of tuples (employee_name, department_name)

# Example usage
employees_with_departments = get_employee_department_names()
for emp in employees_with_departments:
    print(emp)

```

### Explanation:

1. **SQL Schema Understanding**: We have two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`. Each employee belongs to a department identified by `department_id`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - We define a function `get_employee_department_names`.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of an employee and the name of their department.

3. **Database Connection**: 
   - We use SQLite for demonstration purposes, but you can use any database connection library (like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL or `pymysql` for MySQL).
   - Always ensure to connect to your specific database.

4. **Executing SQL Query**: 
   - We write a SQL query to perform a join operation between the `Employees` and the `Departments` table to fetch the required data.

5. **Fetching Results**:
   - The results are fetched using `cursor.fetchall()`, which gets all the records returned by the query.

6. **Cleanup**: 
   - Always close the cursor and the connection to prevent memory leaks.

7. **Return Value**: 
   - Finally, the function returns the list of employee names along with their department names.

Now, if you could provide the specific SQL problem you want to solve, I would be happy to refine this code or provide a new one tailored to your requirements!

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It appears that your request is incomplete, as there is no specific problem statement provided. However, I can guide you on how to format your solution for LeetCode and detail how you would typically approach SQL problems in Python or a similar context.

In LeetCode, problems often come with an associated SQL query requirement. Assuming your problem involves querying a database, here’s a simple example of how you would typically work with SQL-related problems in LeetCode with Python.

Let’s take a hypothetical problem where you need to find employees working in the 'Sales' department with a particular focus on how to format the solution:

### Problem Statement
**Find all employees who work in the 'Sales' department and return their names and salaries sorted by salary in descending order.**

### SQL Schema
Assuming we have the following SQL table defined:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    department VARCHAR(255),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

```

### Example Input / Output
For example, given the table rows:

```plaintext
| id | name     | department | salary |
|----|----------|------------|--------|
| 1  | Alice    | Sales      | 70000  |
| 2  | Bob      | HR         | 50000  |
| 3  | Charlie   | Sales      | 80000  |
| 4  | David    | Engineering | 90000  |

```
The output should be:

```plaintext
| name    | salary |
|---------|--------|
| Charlie | 80000  |
| Alice   | 70000  |

```

### Python Code for LeetCode Submission
We will use the SQL Execution context within LeetCode, which allows us to write SQL queries as strings. Here’s how you format your solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def find_sales_employees(self) -> str:
        return """
        SELECT name, salary 
        FROM Employees 
        WHERE department = 'Sales' 
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        """

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Class Definition**: LeetCode often requires you to encapsulate your solution in a class. Here, `Solution` is the name of the class.
2. **Method Definition**: The method `find_sales_employees` does not take any parameters and returns a string representing the SQL query.
3. **SQL Query**: 
   - `SELECT name, salary` selects the columns we are interested in.
   - `FROM Employees` specifies the table we are querying.
   - `WHERE department = 'Sales'` filters the results to include only those in the 'Sales' department.
   - `ORDER BY salary DESC` sorts the results in descending order according to salaries.

### Conclusion
You can directly copy this code into LeetCode if the problem statement aligns with the context provided. Please provide the specific SQL schema or conditions of the problem if you have a different problem in mind, and I will be happy to assist further!

# 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like your message got cut off. You mentioned a "problem" related to "SQL Schema," but I don't have the details of the problem statement or any specific requirements. LeetCode problems often accompany SQL-related tasks, like querying data from tables, aggregating results, or performing joins.

If you could provide the complete problem statement or clarify the details of the SQL schema, I would be happy to help you write a Python solution in a format that can run directly on the LeetCode website. 

For now, I will outline how we would generally format a solution, and you can fill in the specific problem details:



```python
class Solution:
    def your_function_name(self, parameters):
        # Your logic here
        pass

```

In the case of SQL-related problems, you would typically use the SQLite library in Python, but certain problems might need different approaches, especially if they involve data processing.

### Example SQL Task

For illustration, let's assume a hypothetical problem statement for SQL:

**Problem Statement:**
"Given a table `Employees`, write an SQL query to find the names of employees who earn more than the average salary of their department."

**SQL Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department_id INT
);

```

### SQL Solution
Here is how you might craft the SQL query for this problem:


```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) 
                 FROM Employees 
                 WHERE department_id = Employees.department_id);

```

### Python Solution Using Pandas

If you were to solve a similar problem using Python and Pandas, the code would look like this:



```python
import pandas as pd

class Solution:
    def above_average_employees(self, employees_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        # Calculate the average salary for each department
        avg_salary = employees_df.groupby('department_id')['salary'].mean().reset_index()
        avg_salary.columns = ['department_id', 'avg_salary']
        
        # Merge the average salaries back with the original DataFrame
        merged_df = pd.merge(employees_df, avg_salary, on='department_id')
        
        # Filter employees that earn more than the average salary in their department
        result = merged_df[merged_df['salary'] > merged_df['avg_salary']]
        
        return result[['name']]

```

### Explanation:
1. **Group Data**: We aggregate salaries by department to calculate the average.
2. **Merge Data**: We merge this average back with the original DataFrame to compare each employee's salary against their departmental average.
3. **Filter Results**: Finally, we filter for those employees whose salary exceeds the average for their department.

This format, replacing the example problem with yours if provided, ensures clarity and can be submitted to LeetCode's online judge.

If you could share the details regarding the SQL schema or problem, I would be glad to create a tailored solution!

# 1173. Immediate Food Delivery I

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems you haven't provided the specific SQL schema or the associated problem description that you want to solve with the Python code. However, I'm happy to help you out with an example based on a common problem that involves SQL schemas.

For illustration, let's consider a problem that involves fetching data from a database. One frequently encountered problem on LeetCode is retrieving information about employees from a company's database.

### Problem Statement
Given the following table structure:

**Employee Table:**

```
+-------------+---------+
| EmployeeId  | Salary  |
+-------------+---------+
|      1      |   1000  |
|      2      |   2000  |
|      3      |   3000  |
|      4      |   4000  |
|      5      |   5000  |
+-------------+---------+

```

Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should return null.

### SQL Solution
To solve this SQL problem, we can use the following SQL query:


```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

```

### Python Code
If you need to simulate that this query can be run directly in LeetCode, you might typically use an ORM or a database connection to fetch the information. However, LeetCode generally requires pure SQL queries for problems related to SQL. 

Nonetheless, here's how you could write a similar function in Python that doesn't actually query a database but works with a list of employee records:



```python
from typing import List, Optional

class Solution:
    def secondHighestSalary(self, employees: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:
        # Remove duplicates and sort the unique salaries
        unique_salaries = sorted(set(employees))
        
        # Check if there are at least two unique salaries
        if len(unique_salaries) < 2:
            return None
        
        # Return the second highest salary
        return unique_salaries[-2]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.secondHighestSalary([1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000])) # Output: 4000
print(sol.secondHighestSalary([1000])) # Output: None
print(sol.secondHighestSalary([1000, 1000, 2000])) # Output: 1000

```

### Explanation
1. **Function Definition**: We create a method called `secondHighestSalary` that takes a list of employee salaries as input.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: We use `set()` to remove duplicate salaries because we are only interested in unique values while finding the second highest salary.
3. **Sorting**: We sort the remaining unique salaries in ascending order.
4. **Condition Check**: We check if there are at least two unique salaries. If not, we return `None`.
5. **Returning Result**: Finally, we access the second last element of the sorted list (which is the second highest salary).

This code provides a Pythonic way to find the second highest salary from a list and simulates the SQL problem. However, for actual database queries, you would typically write and execute the SQL directly on the database as shown in the SQL solution. 

Feel free to provide more details if you have a specific SQL schema or other requirements you'd like help with!

# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Sure! Although your request did not specify the problem related to the SQL schema, I will provide you with a solution for a common SQL-related problem that can be solvable with Python. If you intended a specific problem or context about the SQL schema, please provide more details.

### Problem: Find the Employees with the Highest Salary

Let's assume we have a SQL schema as follows:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    salary INT NOT NULL
);

```

Given this table, the task is to find the employees who have the highest salary.

### LeetCode Solution Format

To solve this problem using Python, we'll typically follow the LeetCode format which includes defining a function that retrieves data. Here is a solution using Python and SQLAlchemy for the database interaction.

### Solution Code



```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData

# Define the SQLAlchemy ORM model for the Employee table
metadata = MetaData()

Employee = Table('Employee', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String(255), nullable=False),
    Column('salary', Integer, nullable=False)
)

def get_highest_salary_employees(engine):
    connection = engine.connect()
    query = '''
    SELECT name
    FROM Employee
    WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)
    '''
    
    result = connection.execute(query)
    high_salary_employees = [row[0] for row in result]
    connection.close()
    return high_salary_employees

# Assuming a SQLAlchemy engine has been created as follows:
# engine = create_engine('sqlite:///your_database.db')  # Example for SQLite
# print(get_highest_salary_employees(engine))

```

### Explanation

1. **Setup a Database Connection**: We begin by creating an SQLAlchemy engine that connects to the database.

2. **Define ORM Table Model**: We define a table schema akin to the SQL table structure we have in the database. This helps in referencing the table in our queries easily.

3. **SQL Query**: The SQL query is crafted to select names of employees whose salary is equal to the maximum salary of the employees. This is done using a subquery that finds the maximum salary.

4. **Execution of Query**: The query is executed against the database connection, and we store the results in a list.

5. **Return the Results**: Finally, we close the connection and return the results as a list of employee names.

### How to Run on LeetCode

If this were put into a LeetCode-style problem, we would replace the database interaction with appropriate function calls that pull the necessary data as needed based on the platform's capabilities.

### Note

Make sure to replace the `create_engine` argument with the actual connection string to your database when testing. If running the above code in a local environment, ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed by running:


```bash
pip install sqlalchemy

```

If you have a specific problem or table structure to elaborate on or a different problem requirement, please provide that context for a more tailored solution!

# 1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing

### Problem Description 
Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length` and do the assignment `arr1[i] = arr2[j]`.

If there is no way to make `arr1` strictly increasing, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace `5` with `2`, then `arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]`.


Example 2:
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Replace `5` with `3` and then replace `3` with `4`. `arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]`.


Example 3:
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,6,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: You can't make `arr1` strictly increasing.


Constraints:
`1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 2000`
`0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of making the `arr1` array strictly increasing with the help of assignments from `arr2`, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach combined with sorting. The main idea is to maintain an array where each entry represents the minimum number of replacements required to ensure that the first `i` elements of `arr1` are strictly increasing.

### Steps to Implement the Solution:

1. **Sort `arr2`:** Since we can replace elements of `arr1` with elements from `arr2` to help maintain the increasing order, we should sort `arr2` first, which allows us to efficiently find suitable replacements using binary search.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table:** Maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations to ensure the first `i` elements of `arr1` are strictly increasing.

3. **State Transition:** For each element in `arr1`, we check if we can keep that element or replace it with a value from `arr2`. We will maintain the last successfully placed element to look up candidates that are larger than that in `arr2`.

4. **Binary Search:** We can use binary search (via the `bisect` module) on the sorted `arr2` to efficiently find the position to replace in `arr1`.

5. **Return the Result:** Finally, we will return the minimum number of operations required, or `-1` if it's not possible to create a strictly increasing sequence.

Here's how the implementation looks in Python:



```python
from bisect import bisect_right

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort arr2 for efficient searching
        arr2 = sorted(set(arr2))  # Use a set to avoid duplicates

        n = len(arr1)
        # Initialize dp array with a large number (infinity)
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # No operations needed for zero elements

        # Traverse each element in arr1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            current_val = arr1[i - 1]
            # First we can consider not replacing current_val:
            # We need to check if this can be added
            if i == 1 or current_val > arr1[i - 2]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1])  # Keep current value

            # We can replace current_val with any value from arr2
            # We need to replace it with a value greater than arr1[i - 2] if it exists
            pos = bisect_right(arr2, arr1[i - 2])  # Find position in arr2
            if pos < len(arr2):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1)  # Replace current_val with arr2[pos]

            # Also consider the case of replacing it with any valid arr2[j]
            for j in range(len(arr2)):
                if arr2[j] > (arr1[i - 2] if i > 1 else float('-inf')):
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1)  # Replacing arr1[i-1] with arr2[j]

        # Result is the minimum operations to ensure arr1 is strictly increasing
        ans = min(dp[n], n) if n else -1

        return ans if ans != float('inf') else -1

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `dp` array keeps track of the minimum operations needed to keep `arr1` strictly increasing.
- We loop through each element of `arr1`, checking if we can keep it or replace it with a suitable value from `arr2` using binary search.
- Finally, we evaluate the least operations required from the last element of `dp`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n * log(m)), where `n` is the length of `arr1` and `m` is the length of `arr2` due to the nested loop and the binary search.
- Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the `dp` array. 

This provides an efficient solution to the problem within the provided constraints.

# 1188. Design Bounded Blocking Queue

### Problem Description 
Implement a thread-safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:
`BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity)` The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum `capacity`.

`void enqueue(int element)` Adds an `element` to the front of the queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full.

`int dequeue()` Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it. If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.

`int size()` Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.

Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the `enqueue` method or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the `dequeue` method. The `size` method will be called after every test case.

Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.


Example 1:
Input:
1
1
["BoundedBlockingQueue","enqueue","dequeue","dequeue","enqueue","enqueue","enqueue","enqueue","dequeue"]
[[2],[1],[],[],[0],[2],[3],[4],[]]
Output:
[1,0,2,2]
Explanation:
Number of producer threads = 1
Number of consumer threads = 1
BoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(2);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 2.

queue.enqueue(1);   // The producer thread enqueues 1 to the queue.

queue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread calls dequeue and returns 1 from the queue.

queue.dequeue();    // Since the queue is empty, the consumer thread is blocked.

queue.enqueue(0);   // The producer thread enqueues 0 to the queue. The consumer thread is unblocked and returns 0 from the queue.

queue.enqueue(2);   // The producer thread enqueues 2 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(3);   // The producer thread enqueues 3 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(4);   // The producer thread is blocked because the queue's capacity (2) is reached.

queue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread returns 2 from the queue. The producer thread is unblocked and enqueues 4 to the queue.

queue.size();       // 2 elements remaining in the queue. size() is always called at the end of each test case.


Example 2:
Input:
3
4
["BoundedBlockingQueue","enqueue","enqueue","enqueue","dequeue","dequeue","dequeue","enqueue"]
[[3],[1],[0],[2],[],[],[],[3]]
Output:
[1,0,2,1]
Explanation:
Number of producer threads = 3
Number of consumer threads = 4
BoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(3);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 3.

queue.enqueue(1);   // Producer thread P1 enqueues 1 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(0);   // Producer thread P2 enqueues 0 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(2);   // Producer thread P3 enqueues 2 to the queue.

queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C1 calls dequeue.

queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C2 calls dequeue.

queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C3 calls dequeue.

queue.enqueue(3);   // One of the producer threads enqueues 3 to the queue.

queue.size();       // 1 element remaining in the queue.

Since the number of threads for producer/consumer is greater than 1, we do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the input seems to imply the ordering. Therefore, any of the output [1,0,2] or [1,2,0] or [0,1,2] or [0,2,1] or [2,0,1] or [2,1,0] will be accepted.


Constraints:
`1 <= Number of Prdoucers <= 8`
`1 <= Number of Consumers <= 8`
`1 <= size <= 30`
`0 <= element <= 20`
The number of calls to `enqueue` is greater than or equal to the number of calls to `dequeue`.

At most `40` calls will be made to `enque`, `deque`, and `size`.

### Solution 
 To implement a thread-safe bounded blocking queue in Python, we will use threading primitives from the `threading` module, specifically `Semaphore` and `Condition`. This will allow us to manage access to the queue while ensuring that the queue operates correctly in a multi-threaded environment.

### Overview
The `BoundedBlockingQueue` class will maintain a fixed-size queue using a list. We will use a `Semaphore` to keep track of the number of empty slots in the queue (to block producers when the queue is full) and another `Semaphore` to keep track of the number of filled slots (to block consumers when the queue is empty). 

Additionally, we will use a `Condition` variable to synchronize access when producers or consumers are waiting.

### Implementation

Here's how the code is structured:

1. **`__init__`:** Initializes the queue, semaphores, and condition.
2. **`enqueue`:** Adds an element to the front of the queue and handles blocking if the queue is full.
3. **`dequeue`:** Removes and returns the last element of the queue and blocks if the queue is empty.
4. **`size`:** Returns the current size of the queue.



```python
import threading
from collections import deque

class BoundedBlockingQueue:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.queue = deque()
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.not_empty = threading.Semaphore(0)  # Count of filled slots
        self.not_full = threading.Semaphore(capacity)  # Count of empty slots
        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.lock)

    def enqueue(self, element: int) -> None:
        self.not_full.acquire()  # Wait if the queue is full
        with self.lock:
            self.queue.appendleft(element)  # Add to the front
            self.condition.notify()  # Notify a consumer that an item is available
        self.not_empty.release()  # Increase count of filled slots

    def dequeue(self) -> int:
        self.not_empty.acquire()  # Wait if the queue is empty
        with self.lock:
            element = self.queue.pop()  # Remove from the rear
            self.condition.notify()  # Notify a producer that an item was removed
        self.not_full.release()  # Increase count of empty slots
        return element

    def size(self) -> int:
        with self.lock:
            return len(self.queue)  # Return the current size of the queue

# Example usage:
# Below code won't run During tests on LeetCode directly, it's only for demonstration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    queue = BoundedBlockingQueue(2)
    queue.enqueue(1)
    print(queue.dequeue())  # Outputs 1
    print(queue.size())     # Outputs 0

```

### Explanation of Components

1. **Constructor (`__init__`)**:
   - Initializes the queue with a maximum capacity (`capacity`).
   - `deque()` is used for efficient appending and popping from both ends.
   - `not_empty` semaphore starts at 0, representing no filled slots.
   - `not_full` semaphore starts at `capacity`, representing all slots are empty.

2. **`enqueue` Method**:
   - Waits until there is space in the queue using `not_full.acquire()`.
   - Appends the element to the front of the queue inside a lock to ensure thread safety.
   - Notifies a potentially waiting consumer that an item is available.
   - Increments the count of filled slots.

3. **`dequeue` Method**:
   - Waits until the queue is non-empty using `not_empty.acquire()`.
   - Pops an element from the rear within the lock.
   - Notifies a potentially waiting producer that an item has been removed.
   - Increments the count of empty slots.

4. **`size` Method**:
   - Simply returns the number of items in the queue using a lock for thread safety.

### Conclusion

This implementation effectively handles concurrent accesses for both producers and consumers, ensuring that the queue operates according to its bounded capacity. The use of semaphores and locks prevents data races and ensures correct blocking behavior when the queue is either full or empty.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 To solve a problem related to SQL Schema, it's important to first have clarity on what the specific question is. Since that detail is not provided in the prompt, I'll create a hypothetical scenario where we need to work with a given SQL table and formulate an SQL query to address a commonly encountered database problem.

### Hypothetical Problem Description

Let's assume we have the following SQL schema for a database containing information about employees:


```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    department_id INT,
    salary INT
);

```

**Task:** Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return `NULL`.

### SQL Solution

To accomplish this task, we can leverage SQL's `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` clauses. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employee 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

```

### Explanation of the SQL Query

1. **SELECT DISTINCT salary**: This selects unique salary values from the `Employee` table. Using `DISTINCT` ensures that we do not consider duplicate salaries.

2. **FROM Employee**: This indicates that we are querying data from the `Employee` table.

3. **ORDER BY salary DESC**: We order the results by `salary` in descending order. This means the highest salary will come first in the results.

4. **LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1**: 
   - `LIMIT 1` restricts the results to one row.
   - `OFFSET 1` specifies that we skip the first row (which is the highest salary) and retrieve the second row, which corresponds to the second highest salary.

If the second highest salary does not exist (for instance, if there is only one unique salary in the table), the query will return `NULL`.

### Complete LeetCode SQL Solution

To fit the LeetCode format, this SQL query can be submitted directly on the LeetCode website as follows:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employee 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

```

### Conclusion

This SQL query can be directly executed in the LeetCode platform or any SQL-compatible system to retrieve the second highest unique salary from the Employee table. The use of `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` with `OFFSET` proves to be an effective method to solve this problem.

# 1194. Tournament Winners

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems that the description of the problem you want to solve is incomplete. However, I can give you an example of how to implement a solution for a typical problem on LeetCode and how to write the code following their format. Let’s pick a commonly encountered problem which is popular among users, such as "Two Sum".

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example


```python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

```

### LeetCode Format Solution

We will implement the solution in Python below:



```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = {}
        
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], index]
            
            num_to_index[num] = index

        # If no solution is found, we raise an error.
        raise ValueError("No two sum solution")

```

### Explanation

1. **Class Definition**:
   - We define a class named `Solution` as per LeetCode's requirement.

2. **Method Definition**:
   - We define the method `twoSum` which takes in two parameters: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

3. **Dictionary for Indices**:
   - We initialize an empty dictionary `num_to_index` which will be used to store numbers as keys and their respective indices as values.

4. **Iterating through the List**:
   - We use `enumerate` to iterate through `nums`, capturing both the `index` and the `num` (the current number).

5. **Finding the Complement**:
   - For each number, we calculate its complement by subtracting it from `target`. The equation here is `complement = target - num`.

6. **Checking for the Complement**:
   - We check if the complement already exists in the `num_to_index` dictionary:
     - If it exists, we return a list containing the index of the complement and the current index, as we have found our solution.
     - If it does not exist, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If no solution is found by the end of the loop (which shouldn't happen based on the problem constraints), we raise a `ValueError`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list `nums`. We traverse the list once and perform O(1) operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, if all numbers are unique and stored in the dictionary.

You can easily copy this code into LeetCode and run it by filling in the appropriate input values for `nums` and `target`.

If you have a specific SQL problem or any particular schema you need assistance with, please provide more details, and I can help you with that as well!

# 1195. Fizz Buzz Multithreaded

### Problem Description 
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n, however:
If the number is divisible by 3, output "fizz".

If the number is divisible by 5, output "buzz".

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "fizzbuzz".

For example, for `n = 15`, we output: `1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz`.

Suppose you are given the following code:
class FizzBuzz {
  public FizzBuzz(int n) { ... }               // constructor
  public void fizz(printFizz) { ... }          // only output "fizz"
  public void buzz(printBuzz) { ... }          // only output "buzz"
  public void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz) { ... }  // only output "fizzbuzz"
  public void number(printNumber) { ... }      // only output the numbers
}
Implement a multithreaded version of `FizzBuzz` with four threads. The same instance of `FizzBuzz` will be passed to four different threads:
Thread A will call `fizz()` to check for divisibility of 3 and outputs `fizz`.

Thread B will call `buzz()` to check for divisibility of 5 and outputs `buzz`.

Thread C will call `fizzbuzz()` to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and outputs `fizzbuzz`.

Thread D will call `number()` which should only output the numbers.

### Solution 
 To solve the FizzBuzz problem in a multithreaded way as described, we need to implement a class that coordinates the output of "fizz", "buzz", "fizzbuzz", and the numbers from 1 to n in a synchronized manner using multiple threads.

The key requirements are:
1. Use four separate threads: one for "fizz", one for "buzz", one for "fizzbuzz", and one for the numbers.
2. The threads must cooperate to ensure the correct output sequence.
3. Use synchronization mechanisms to manage access to shared resources (the current number being processed).

We'll implement this using Python's `threading` module along with `Condition` objects to facilitate the control flow between threads.

Here is the implementation of the multithreaded FizzBuzz class following the LeetCode solution format:



```python
import threading

class FizzBuzz:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.n = n
        self.current = 1
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.lock)

    def fizz(self, printFizz: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for i in range(1, self.n + 1):
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and (self.current % 3 != 0 or self.current % 5 == 0):
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current <= self.n:
                    printFizz()  # output "fizz"
                    self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

    def buzz(self, printBuzz: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for i in range(1, self.n + 1):
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and (self.current % 5 != 0 or self.current % 3 == 0):
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current <= self.n:
                    printBuzz()  # output "buzz"
                    self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

    def fizzbuzz(self, printFizzBuzz: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for i in range(1, self.n + 1):
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and self.current % 15 != 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current <= self.n:
                    printFizzBuzz()  # output "fizzbuzz"
                    self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

    def number(self, printNumber: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        for i in range(1, self.n + 1):
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and (self.current % 3 == 0 or self.current % 5 == 0):
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current <= self.n:
                    printNumber()  # output the current number
                    self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    - We initialize the class with the maximum number `n` to print.
    - We maintain a variable `current` to track the current number to be processed.
    - A `Condition` is used to facilitate synchronization between threads.

2. **Methods (`fizz`, `buzz`, `fizzbuzz`, `number`)**:
    - Each method uses a loop that continues until the `current` number is less than or equal to `n`.
    - Each method checks conditions to determine whether it's allowed to print its specific output:
        - `fizz`: Outputs "fizz" when `current` is divisible by 3.
        - `buzz`: Outputs "buzz" when `current` is divisible by 5.
        - `fizzbuzz`: Outputs "fizzbuzz" when `current` is divisible by both (i.e., by 15).
        - `number`: Outputs the number when neither condition for "fizz" nor "buzz" applies.
    - The `while` loop uses `condition.wait()` to yield control if the thread cannot print at that time, hence preventing it from hogging the CPU.
    - After printing, the methods notify all other threads (`condition.notify_all()`) to check their conditions.

3. **Concurrency Control**: This setup ensures that every thread correctly prints its output in synchronization with others, satisfying the requirements of the FizzBuzz problem.

### How to Run:
You can directly copy the above class definition to a LeetCode problem that expects a solution in this interface. Make sure that the class is instantiated with `n`, and then start four threads corresponding to the methods `fizz`, `buzz`, `fizzbuzz`, and `number` while passing appropriate print functions for each. 

Here's a brief example of how to run it:



```python
def print_fizz():
    print("fizz", end=', ')

def print_buzz():
    print("buzz", end=', ')

def print_fizzbuzz():
    print("fizzbuzz", end=', ')

def print_number():
    print(fizzbuzz_instance.current - 1, end=', ')

fizzbuzz_instance = FizzBuzz(15)

thread_a = threading.Thread(target=fizzbuzz_instance.fizz, args=(print_fizz,))
thread_b = threading.Thread(target=fizzbuzz_instance.buzz, args=(print_buzz,))
thread_c = threading.Thread(target=fizzbuzz_instance.fizzbuzz, args=(print_fizzbuzz,))
thread_d = threading.Thread(target=fizzbuzz_instance.number, args=(print_number,))

thread_a.start()
thread_b.start()
thread_c.start()
thread_d.start()

thread_a.join()
thread_b.join()
thread_c.join()
thread_d.join()

```

This example initializes a `FizzBuzz` instance with `n = 15`, and starts the four threads while passing the appropriate print functions.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 To provide you with a Python solution that follows the LeetCode format, I'll first need to summarize a common LeetCode problem related to SQL schema. Since you've mentioned SQL but did not specify a particular problem, I'll assume you might be interested in generating a Python solution to a problem that typically involves querying data from a specified SQL schema. 

Here's an example problem that fits the SQL use case:

### Problem Statement
Given the following SQL schema:


```
Employees
+---------+----------+
| empId   | name     |
+---------+----------+
| 1       | Joe      |
| 2       | Henry    |
| 3       | Sam      |
| 4       | Max      |
+---------+----------+

Salary
+---------+----------+
| empId   | salary   |
+---------+----------+
| 1       | 100000   |
| 2       | 150000   |
| 3       | 200000   |
| 4       | 300000   |
+---------+----------+

```

Write a SQL query to find the names of employees whose salary is higher than the average salary of all employees.

### SQL Query Solution
Here is the SQL query that can be used to retrieve the desired information:


```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employees
WHERE empId IN (
    SELECT empId
    FROM Salary
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Salary)
);

```

### Python Solution to Fetch Results

Now, assuming you want a Python solution that can be run, for example, in a framework that forms the backbone of a LeetCode-like environment, we can structure it as a class method. Here's how you could implement something similar in Python.



```python
import sqlite3

class Solution:
    def getEmployeesWithSalaryHigherThanAverage(self):
        # Connect to in-memory SQLite database (for demo purposes)
        conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # Create Employees and Salary tables
        cursor.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE Employees (
                empId INT PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT
            )
        ''')
        cursor.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE Salary (
                empId INT PRIMARY KEY,
                salary INT
            )
        ''')

        # Inserting data into Employees table
        employees_data = [
            (1, 'Joe'),
            (2, 'Henry'),
            (3, 'Sam'),
            (4, 'Max')
        ]
        cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO Employees (empId, name) VALUES (?, ?)', employees_data)

        # Inserting data into Salary table
        salary_data = [
            (1, 100000),
            (2, 150000),
            (3, 200000),
            (4, 300000)
        ]
        cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO Salary (empId, salary) VALUES (?, ?)', salary_data)

        # SQL query to find employees earning above average salary
        query = '''
            SELECT E.name
            FROM Employees E
            INNER JOIN Salary S ON E.empId = S.empId
            WHERE S.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Salary)
        '''
        
        # Execute the query
        cursor.execute(query)
        
        # Fetch results
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        
        # Close the database connection
        conn.close()
        
        # Return the names of the employees
        return [name for (name,) in result]

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
result = solution.getEmployeesWithSalaryHigherThanAverage()
print(result)  # Output: ['Sam', 'Max']

```

### Explanation
1. **Database Setup**: We create an in-memory SQLite database and define the `Employees` and `Salary` tables.
2. **Data Insertion**: We populate these tables with sample data.
3. **Query Execution**: We write and execute a SQL query that computes the employees whose salary exceeds the average salary.
4. **Fetch Results**: We retrieve the results and return the names of those employees.
5. **Test the Method**: Finally, an instance of the `Solution` class is created, and the method is called to display the output.

This method adheres to Python's conventions and could be adapted for LeetCode requirements or other testing environments. The approach to querying and execution would need to incorporate your environment's specific features (e.g., JDBC for Java-based setups, etc.).

# 1205. Monthly Transactions II

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like your message is incomplete, and I don't see the specific problem you'd like help with. However, based on what you've provided, it seems you're looking for a solution to a LeetCode-style problem related to SQL. 

To provide a comprehensive, example solution, I'll create a SQL problem scenario and demonstrate how to write a Python solution for it. Let's assume a problem where we need to extract some data from a table called `Employees`, which has the following schema:

### Problem Description
We have a table `Employees` defined as follows:

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| employee_id  | int     | Unique ID for each employee (Primary Key)        |
| name         | varchar | Name of the employee                              |
| department   | varchar | Department where the employee works               |
| salary       | int     | Salary of the employee                             |

Write a SQL query to find the employees with a salary greater than the average salary of their respective department.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM Employees e
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary)
                 FROM Employees
                 WHERE department = e.department);

```

### Explanation of the SQL Query
1. The outer query selects the `name` and `department` from the `Employees` table.
2. The `WHERE` clause uses a correlated subquery that calculates the average salary for each department.
3. We only select employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their respective department.

### Python Solution for the Same Problem
While the original problem is SQL-related, if we were to approach a similar problem in Python, it might look like this:



```python
# Importing required libraries
from typing import List, Dict

# Definition for Employee data
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id: int, name: str, department: str, salary: int):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.department = department
        self.salary = salary

def employees_with_above_average_salary(employees: List[Employee]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the average salary per department
    department_salary = defaultdict(list)
    
    for emp in employees:
        department_salary[emp.department].append(emp.salary)
    
    avg_salary_department = {}
    
    for department, salaries in department_salary.items():
        avg_salary_department[department] = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)

    # Step 2: Find employees with salaries greater than their department's average
    result = []
    
    for emp in employees:
        if emp.salary > avg_salary_department[emp.department]:
            result.append({'name': emp.name, 'department': emp.department})

    return result

# Example Usage
employees = [
    Employee(1, "Alice", "Engineering", 70000),
    Employee(2, "Bob", "Engineering", 50000),
    Employee(3, "Charlie", "HR", 60000),
    Employee(4, "David", "HR", 30000)
]

result = employees_with_above_average_salary(employees)
print(result)  # Outputs employees with salary greater than the avg salary in their department

```

### Explanation of the Python Code
1. We defined an `Employee` class to represent employee entries.
2. The function `employees_with_above_average_salary` takes a list of `Employee` objects.
3. It uses a `defaultdict` to accumulate salaries by department, then computes average salaries.
4. We loop over each employee, checking if their salary exceeds the average of their department, appending qualifying entries to the `result` list.
5. Finally, the function returns a list of dictionaries containing the names and departments of qualifying employees.

# 1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! It seems like your question was cut off after "SQL Schema." However, I'll provide a generic outline of how to solve a problem in Python following the LeetCode-style solution format, using a hypothetical SQL problem as a context.

### Hypothetical Problem
**Problem**: Given a table named `Employees` with the following schema:


```
+-----------+---------+
| Employee  | Salary  |
+-----------+---------+
| John      | 100000  |
| Jane      | 150000  |
| Alice     | 120000  |
| Bob       | 110000  |
+-----------+---------+

```

**Task**: Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary from the `Employees` table.

**Expected Output**:

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 120000              |
+---------------------+

```

### SQL Solution
Here's the SQL query that would solve this problem:


```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);

```

### Python Solution
If we wanted to approach this with a Python function (assuming a list of dictionaries representing the table instead of SQL), this could look like the following:



```python
from typing import List, Dict

class Solution:
    def secondHighestSalary(self, employees: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> int:
        # First, we need to create a set of all unique salaries
        salaries = set()

        for employee in employees:
            # Convert salary to integer and add to the set
            salaries.add(int(employee['Salary']))

        # Remove the maximum salary, if there's more than one unique salary
        if len(salaries) < 2:
            return -1
        
        salaries.remove(max(salaries))  # Remove max salary to find second max

        # Finding the maximum salary from the remaining salaries
        return max(salaries)

```

### Detailed Explanation
1. **Input Structure**: The input is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an employee with their name and salary.
   
2. **Using a Set**: We use a set to store unique salaries because this will automatically handle duplicates and simplify the search for the second highest salary.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: We first check if there are at least two unique salaries. If not, we return -1, indicating that there’s no second highest salary.

4. **Removing the Highest**: We remove the highest salary from the set, which allows us to focus only on the remaining salaries.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the maximum salary from the modified set of salaries, which will now represent the second largest unique salary.

### Running the Solution on LeetCode
If you were to implement this solution directly in LeetCode, you would:
1. Define the `Solution` class as shown.
2. Use the `secondHighestSalary` method to check against test cases defined in LeetCode.

### Sample Test Case
You can use the following test case to validate the solution:



```python
# Example of how to call the function in a test case
employees = [
    {"Employee": "John", "Salary": "100000"},
    {"Employee": "Jane", "Salary": "150000"},
    {"Employee": "Alice", "Salary": "120000"},
    {"Employee": "Bob", "Salary": "110000"}
]

solution = Solution()
result = solution.secondHighestSalary(employees)
print(result)  # Output should be 120000

```

This code follows the LeetCode format for solutions effectively. Be sure to replace the example with the specific SQL schema or task once you acquire that information for proper context.

# 1212. Team Scores in Football Tournament

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 To help you create a solution that can be run directly on the LeetCode website, we'll first need to clarify the problem you want us to solve. Since the provided information only mentioned "SQL Schema," it seems that you might be asking for a SQL-related problem that is common in coding interviews, especially on platforms like LeetCode.

Let’s consider a hypothetical SQL problem to illustrate how to write a solution in a typical format used on LeetCode:

### Problem Example:
**Title:** "Find Customers with Orders"

**Description:**

Table: `Customers`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| customer_id | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |

`customer_id` is the primary key for this table.

Table: `Orders`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| order_id   | int     |
| order_date | date    |
| customer_id | int     |

`order_id` is the primary key for this table.

Write a SQL query to find the `customer_id` and `customer_name` of customers who have made an order. The result should be sorted in ascending order by `customer_id`.

### SQL Solution:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;

```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT**: We are using `DISTINCT` to ensure that we return unique customers, in case a customer has made multiple orders.
2. **FROM Customers c**: This indicates that we are selecting from the `Customers` table, using the alias `c`.
3. **JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id**: We perform an inner join between the `Customers` and `Orders` tables. This will combine rows from both tables whenever a customer has made an order.
4. **ORDER BY c.customer_id**: Finally, we order the results by `customer_id` in ascending order.

### Running on LeetCode:
This SQL solution can be copied directly into the SQL editor provided by LeetCode for this specific problem. Ensure your schema aligns with the provided one in the problem description, and you should be good to go.

If you had a different problem or need assistance with a different type of question (e.g., Python, algorithms, data structures, etc.), please provide the details, and I will be glad to assist!

# 1225. Report Contiguous Dates

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 Certainly! It seems there is some confusion because you mentioned SQL Schema, but there is no specific problem provided. However, I will assume that you want a Python solution that could conceptually relate to data manipulations similar to SQL using data structures, as might be the case on LeetCode.

Let's tackle a common SQL-related problem often posed in coding interviews, which involves querying a database schema for specific data. For this example, I will choose the problem of finding the top-k employees based on their salaries from a given SQL schema.

### Problem Example
Given a table "Employee" with fields "Id" (integer), "Name" (string), and "Salary" (integer), we want to find the names of the top k employees with the highest salaries.

### SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Salary INT
);

```

### Problem Statement
Write a Python function that returns the names of the top k employees with the highest salaries. If there are not enough employees, include names of all available employees.

### Example
**Input:**

```sql
Employee = [
    (1, "John", 100),
    (2, "Jane", 200),
    (3, "Dave", 150),
]
k = 2

```
**Output:**


```python
["Jane", "Dave"]

```

### Python Code
We will implement a Python function to solve this problem using a list of tuples to simulate the given SQL table structure.



```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def topKEmployees(self, employees: List[List], k: int) -> List[str]:
        # Sort employees based on the Salary in descending order
        employees.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        
        # Get the top k employee names
        top_k_employee_names = [employees[i][1] for i in range(min(k, len(employees)))]
        
        return top_k_employee_names

# Example test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Example employee data
    Employee = [
        [1, "John", 100],
        [2, "Jane", 200],
        [3, "Dave", 150],
    ]
    
    k = 2
    result = solution.topKEmployees(Employee, k)
    print(result)  # Output: ['Jane', 'Dave']

```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Input Representation**: The `employees` parameter is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to an employee entry `(Id, Name, Salary)`.
  
2. **Sorting Logic**: We use the `sort()` method with a custom sorting key that sorts based on the Salary (the third element in each employee inner list) in descending order. This places the highest salaries at the front of the list.

3. **Fetching Top-k Names**: We create a new list with comprehension where we collect the names of the top k employees. The `min(k, len(employees))` function ensures that we only attempt to access elements that exist in the employees list, preventing any index errors.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns a list of names. The main block is for testing purposes, and you can modify the `Employee` data and `k` value to check different scenarios.

### Final Note
The above code is structured to be submitted in a coding environment similar to LeetCode, with the function signature tailored to their format. Adjust the input according to how you would typically encounter it in an online coding platform.

# 1226. The Dining Philosophers

### Problem Description 
Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org
The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function `void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork)` where:
`philosopher` is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.

`pickLeftFork` and `pickRightFork` are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.

`eat` is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.

`putLeftFork` and `putRightFork` are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.

The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]
Explanation:
n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.

The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.

- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.

- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.


Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 60`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of the dining philosophers, we need to implement a concurrent algorithm that allows each philosopher to alternate between thinking and eating without the risk of starvation. The solution involves using synchronization mechanisms provided by threading in Python.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach we'll take:

### Key Concepts
1. **Philosopher Representation**: Each philosopher can be represented by a thread that wants to pick up their left and right forks, eat spaghetti when they have both, and put the forks down after finishing.

2. **Concurrency Management**: We can manage the acquisition and release of forks using Python's threading mechanisms, specifically with condition variables or locks to ensure that forks are not picked up simultaneously by two philosophers.

3. **Data Structures**:
   - An array (or list) to keep track of the states of the forks.
   - A result list to record the sequence of actions (pick, put, eat).

### Implementation
Below is a Python implementation that meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. The function `wantsToEat` will simulate the behavior of philosophers using locks to avoid conflicts while trying to pick up forks.



```python
from threading import Lock
import threading

class DiningPhilosophers:
    def __init__(self):
        self.forks = [Lock() for _ in range(5)]  # Locks for each fork
        self.output = []  # To track actions

    def wantsToEat(self, philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork):
        left_fork = philosopher
        right_fork = (philosopher + 1) % 5

        # Think before eating (simulated by not doing anything)

        # Pick left fork
        pickLeftFork()
        self.output.append([philosopher, 1, 1])
        
        # Attempt to pick right fork
        self.forks[right_fork].acquire()
        self.output.append([philosopher, 2, 1])
        
        # Now eat
        eat()
        self.output.append([philosopher, 0, 3])

        # Put down right fork
        putRightFork()
        self.output.append([philosopher, 2, 2])
        
        # Put down left fork
        putLeftFork()
        self.output.append([philosopher, 1, 2])
        
    def run_philosopher(self, philosopher):
        # Simulate the philosopher trying to eat multiple times
        for _ in range(n):
            self.wantsToEat(philosopher, 
                            lambda: self.forks[philosopher].acquire(), 
                            lambda: self.forks[(philosopher + 1) % 5].acquire(), 
                            lambda: None,  # Placeholder for eating function
                            lambda: self.forks[(philosopher + 1) % 5].release(), 
                            lambda: self.forks[philosopher].release())

# Initialize the DiningPhilosophers class
diningPhilosophers = DiningPhilosophers()

# Start threads for each philosopher
n = 1  # Set number of times each philosopher will call the function
threads = []
for philosopher in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=diningPhilosophers.run_philosopher, args=(philosopher,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Join all threads
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

# Output the result
print(diningPhilosophers.output)

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: A list of locks (`self.forks`) is created to represent each fork, ensuring that they can be individually locked.

2. **Thread Execution**: Each philosopher runs in a separate thread and repeatedly tries to eat spaghetti. The `run_philosopher` function invokes `wantsToEat` multiple times, based on the variable `n`.

3. **Fork Management**: 
    - Each philosopher tries to pick up their left fork first and then their right fork. If the right fork is available (the lock is acquired), the philosopher can eat.
    - After eating, the philosopher puts down both forks by releasing their locks.

4. **Recording Actions**: Every action (pick up or put down a fork, eat) is logged in the `self.output` list to capture the sequence of events.

### Note:
- Make sure to implement the `eat` function appropriately in a real scenario to represent the eating operation.
- This implementation aims to provide a solution to both avoid deadlock and ensure that no philosopher will starve. 

You can directly copy this code and run it in a Python environment that supports threading. Adjust `n` (the number of eating attempts) as needed to see various output scenarios.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It looks like your message got cut off, and I don't see the complete problem statement or SQL schema you intended to provide. However, I can guide you through how to write a solution for a typical LeetCode problem, including proper structure and coding style.

Here’s an example of how to solve a common type of problem with explanations. Let’s assume you want to solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of a subarray (a common array-related problem). 

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### Example:
Input: `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

### Detailed Solution Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which works as follows:
1. Initialize two variables: `current_sum` to store the maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current position, and `max_sum` to keep track of the overall maximum sum found.
2. As we iterate over the array, we update `current_sum` to be either the current number itself (if starting a new subarray gives a higher sum) or the sum of `current_sum` and the current number (if continuing the current subarray is better).
3. Update `max_sum` whenever `current_sum` exceeds it.

### Python Code:

Here is how the solution would look in LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize variables to store current sum and maximum sum
        current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
        
        # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
        for num in nums[1:]:
            # Update current sum; either start a new subarray or extend the existing one
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            # Update max sum if current sum is greater
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        
        return max_sum

```

### How to Run this on LeetCode:
1. Open the LeetCode website and navigate to the problem page that matches this description.
2. Select the "Python" language option from the drop-down menu.
3. Copy and paste the code provided above into the code editor.
4. Click on the "Run" button to test against the provided test cases or "Submit" to evaluate against all test cases.

### Explanation of the Code:
- The class `Solution` is defined as per LeetCode requirements.
- The method `maxSubArray` takes a list of integers `nums` as an argument.
- We initialize `current_sum` and `max_sum` to the first element of `nums` to handle potential cases where all elements are negative.
- We loop through the numbers in `nums`, updating `current_sum` based on the maximum of the current number and the sum of `current_sum` plus the current number. This determines whether to start fresh from the current number or to continue the previous subarray.
- Finally, `max_sum` keeps track of the maximum sum found and is returned as the output.

### Problem Description 
SQL Schema

### Solution 
 It seems like you intended to provide a specific SQL problem or schema, but it didn't come through. However, I can assist you in writing SQL queries or working on data structure problems commonly found on platforms like LeetCode.

Below, I'll walk you through a typical SQL problem solution format that you can modify according to a specific problem once you provide details. Let's consider a typical SQL problem example where we need to retrieve data from a hypothetical table. 

### Problem Example:
Suppose we have a table called `Employees`, and we want to write a query to find the names of employees who earn more than the average salary.

#### SQL Schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

```

### LeetCode Solution Format
Here's how you'd write the SQL query directly suitable for a LeetCode submission:


```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees);

```

### Explanation:
1. **Subquery**: The inner query `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees)` calculates the average salary of all employees in the `Employees` table.
2. **Comparison**: The outer query selects names from the `Employees` table where the `salary` of an employee is greater than this average salary.
3. **Output**: The result will return all employee names who earn more than the average.

### Steps to Approach Similar Problems:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully to understand what is required—whether it’s filtering, aggregating, joining tables, etc.
2. **Identify Tables and Columns**: Look at the SQL schema to recognize which tables and what columns you will be working with.
3. **Formulate Your Query**: Start writing your SQL statement, ensuring to include the main table, the necessary columns, and any conditions.
4. **Test Your Query**: If you are on a platform that supports testing, run your query with sample data to ensure it returns the expected results.
