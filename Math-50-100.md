# 441. Arranging Coins

### Problem Description 
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.


Example 1:
n = 5
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.


Example 2:
n = 8
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, you can either use a mathematical approach involving a formula derived from the sum of arithmetic series, or you can apply a direct iterative simulation approach.

The total number of coins required to form a staircase up to the k-th row is given by the formula: 

\[ S(k) = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \]

The task is to find the largest `k` such that `S(k) <= n`.

### Approach: Iterative Simulation
This approach iteratively checks how many full rows can be constructed with the given `n` coins by trying to place `1, 2, 3, ...` coins until `n` is exhausted.

1. Start with `k = 1`, since the first row needs at least one coin.
2. Iteratively try to form each row with the required number of coins until there are not enough coins left to form the next full row.
3. Maintain a count of how many full rows `k` can be constructed.
4. Decrease `n` by `k` coins to account for the coins used in forming the `k`-th row and then increment `k` for the next row.

### Python Code using an Iterative Approach


```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
    
        k = 1
        while n >= k:
            n -= k
            k += 1
        return k - 1

# Examples:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.arrangeCoins(5))  # Output: 2
print(sol.arrangeCoins(8))  # Output: 3

```

In this code:
- `k` is incremented starting from 1 and used to simulate the count of coins required for each row.
- `n` is adjusted by subtracting the coins required for each row.
- The loop continues until there are not enough coins left to form the next row fully, i.e., when `n < k`.
- The final `k - 1` gives the total number of full rows constructed since `k` is incremented prematurely in the last loop iteration when it checks `n >= k`.

This solution will run efficiently in `O(K)` time where `K` is the number of complete rows that can be formed. For practical inputs fitting within a 32-bit signed integer, this is a rapid and direct computation.

# 447. Number of Boomerangs

### Problem Description 
You are given `n` `points` in the plane that are all distinct, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. A boomerang is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k` (the order of the tuple matters).

Return the number of boomerangs.


Example 1:
Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].


Example 2:
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: points = [[1,1]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`n == points.length`
`1 <= n <= 500`
`points[i].length == 2`
`-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`
All the points are unique.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of counting the number of boomerangs from a given list of points in a plane, we'll use a hash map to store distances from each point to all other points.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Understand the Boomerang Requirement:** A boomerang is a set of three indices `(i, j, k)` from the points list such that the distance from `i` to `j` is equal to the distance from `i` to `k`.
2. **Use a Hash Map:** For each point `i`, calculate the distance to every other point. Store these distances in a hash map where the key is the distance and the value is the frequency of this distance.
3. **Calculate Boomerangs for Each Point:** For each distance count, if a distance occurs `f` times, the number of permutations of pairs at this distance that can be formed (i.e., picking `j` and `k` which are different points but at the same distance from `i`) is `f * (f - 1)`.
4. **Aggregate Results:** Sum up the results from all points.

### Implementation:


```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def distance_squared(p1, p2):
            return (p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2 + (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2
        
        result = 0
        
        for i in points:
            distance_count = {}
            for j in points:
                if i != j:
                    d = distance_squared(i, j)
                    if d in distance_count:
                        distance_count[d] += 1
                    else:
                        distance_count[d] = 1
            
            for count in distance_count.values():
                if count > 1:
                    result += count * (count - 1)
        
        return result

# This should be used with the statement `from typing import List` if defined externally.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `distance_squared`**: Computes squared distance between two points to avoid floating-point comparison issues (removing need for square root simplifies this).
2. **Outer loop** iterates over all points treating each point as potential point `i`.
3. **Inner loop**: Calculates distances from `i` to every other point `j` and counts them in `distance_count`.
4. **Count pairs**: Using the combination logic, if there are `f` points at the same distance from `i`, then the number of boomerang combinations that can start from `i` and use these `f` points as `j` and `k` is `f * (f - 1)` because `f` choices are there for `j` and `f-1` remaining choices for `k`.

This Python code is structured properly to run directly on the LeetCode platform and should be both efficient and clear for this problem constraint.

# 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment `n - 1` elements of the array by `1`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0

Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`1 <= nums.length <= 104`
`-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Solution 
 Here is a solution for the problem described using Python. This solution includes a detailed explanation conformant to the typical format you might see on competitive programming platforms like LeetCode.



```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Find the minimum element in the array
        min_val = min(nums)
        
        moves = 0
        # Calculate the number of moves needed to make all elements equal to the minimum element
        for num in nums:
            moves += num - min_val
            
        return moves

```

**Explanation of the Solution:**
1. **Initial Idea**: Given that in each move, you can increment \( n-1 \) elements of the array by 1, it might at first seem a bit confusing. An equivalent and easier problem formulation is to think about it in reverse: instead of incrementing \( n-1 \) elements by 1, consider it as decrementing 1 element by 1. Thus, making all elements in the array equal is about decrementing various elements down to the minimum element in the array.

2. **Find Minimum**: The first step is to find the minimal element in the array, which can be done using the `min()` function.

3. **Total Moves Calculation**: 
    - To make all elements in the array equal to this minimum value, each of the other elements would need to be decremented multiple times (down to this minimum value). 
    - The total number of decrement operations required (for all elements) becomes the measure of our solution, and it's equivalent to the increments in the original problem's move definition.
    - We accumulate differences between each element `num` and `min_val` to calculate the total number of moves.

This approach has a complexity of \( O(n) \) due to the loop through the array, where \( n \) is the size of the input list `nums`. This is efficient as per the constraints provided.

# 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

### Problem Description 
Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.


Example:
Input:
[1,2,3]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

### Solution 
 To solve this problem of making all elements of an array equal with the minimum amount of moves, where a move consists of incrementing or decrementing an element by 1, we can leverage a key statistical property: the median.

When the target number to which all elements should be equalized is the median of the array, the total number of moves required is minimized because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from any point in the data.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. First, sort the array. This step has a complexity of O(n log n).
2. Identify the median of the sorted array:
   - If the length of the array is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the length of the array is even, you can choose either of the two middle elements as the median in a practical implementation, though theoretically, any number between them would work (we would use an integer in this case).
3. Calculate the total number of moves by summing the absolute differences between each element and the median.

This approach is efficient and understandable, aligning well with our problem's constraints. Let's proceed to implement this solution.



```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        median = nums[len(nums) // 2]
        moves = 0
        for num in nums:
            moves += abs(num - median)
        return moves

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.minMoves2([1,2,3]))  # Output: 2

```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: We sort `nums` to easily find the median.
2. **Finding the Median**: For an array of odd length, median is the middle element (`nums[len(nums) // 2]`). For an even length, choosing either of the two middle elements will work.
3. **Calculating Moves**: We iterate through the array and accumulate the absolute differences between each element and the median.

This approach is both optimal and straightforward, utilizing properties of the median to minimize the required moves efficiently. The computational complexity primarily comprises the sorting step, O(n log n), which is well-suited for the problem’s constraints.

# 469. Convex Polygon

### Problem Description 
Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).

Note:
There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.

Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.

You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.


Example 1:
[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Answer: True
Explanation:

Example 2:
[[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]
Answer: False
Explanation:

### Solution 
 Here's a Python solution that determines if a given polygon is convex. To do this, we will utilize the cross product of vectors, which provides us information about the direction of the angle between them.

A polygon is convex if all interior angles are less than 180 degrees or, equivalently, if you are always turning in the same direction as you traverse the corners of the polygon. You can use the cross product for this determination: if you take three consecutive points `(A, B, C)` on the polygon, then the cross product of vectors `AB` and `BC` can tell the "direction" of the turn at point `B`. If the sign of the cross product remains consistent for all corners of the polygon, then the polygon is convex.

Below is a Python function, entitled `isConvex`, that you can directly use in LeetCode after copying and pasting it into the code editor:



```python
class Solution:
    def isConvex(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def cross_product(o, a, b):
            return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])
        
        last_sign = 0  # To keep track of the last non-zero cross product sign
        n = len(points)
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Take three consecutive points (using modulo to wrap around)
            p1, p2, p3 = points[i], points[(i+1) % n], points[(i+2) % n]
            # Compute the cross product of the vector p1 to p2 and p2 to p3
            cp = cross_product(p2, p1, p3)
            # Determine the sign of the cross product
            if cp != 0:
                if last_sign == 0:
                    last_sign = cp
                elif (cp > 0 and last_sign < 0) or (cp < 0 and last_sign > 0):
                    return False
                last_sign = cp
        
        return True

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.isConvex([[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]))  # Output: True
# print(sol.isConvex([[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]))  # Output: False

```

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isConvex` that checks if a polygon defined by given points is convex. It uses the helper function `cross_product` to compute the cross product for three points to assess the turn's direction. By checking the consistency of this direction throughout all the given polygon points, the code determines the convexity of the polygon.

In the context of LeetCode, you'll receive runtime and memory usage metrics once you submit the solution.

# 478. Generate Random Point in a Circle

### Problem Description 
Given the radius and the position of the center of a circle, implement the function `randPoint` which generates a uniform random point inside the circle.

Implement the `Solution` class:
`Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center)` initializes the object with the radius of the circle `radius` and the position of the center `(x_center, y_center)`.

`randPoint()` returns a random point inside the circle. A point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle. The answer is returned as an array `[x, y]`.


Example 1:
Input
["Solution", "randPoint", "randPoint", "randPoint"]
[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [-0.02493, -0.38077], [0.82314, 0.38945], [0.36572, 0.17248]]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
solution.randPoint(); // return [-0.02493, -0.38077]
solution.randPoint(); // return [0.82314, 0.38945]
solution.randPoint(); // return [0.36572, 0.17248]

Constraints:
`0 < radius <= 108`
`-107 <= x_center, y_center <= 107`
At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `randPoint`.

### Solution 
 Here's an implementation of the `Solution` class in Python with accompanying explanations both for the class and the `randPoint` method, formalized to be run directly on platforms like LeetCode:



```python
import math
import random

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, radius: float, x_center: float, y_center: float):
        """
        Initializes the object with the radius of the circle 'radius' and
        the position of the center '(x_center, y_center)'.
        """
        self.radius = radius
        self.x_center = x_center
        self.y_center = y_center

    def randPoint(self) -> [float, float]:
        """
        Returns a random point inside the circle.
        A point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle.
        The answer is returned as an array [x, y].
        
        The method uses Polar coordinates where a point inside the circle is represented by:
        R = radius * sqrt(u) and Theta = 2 * pi * v, with u and v being random numbers from [0, 1).
        Using polar-to-cartesian conversion x = r * cos(theta) and y = r * sin(theta), we get our coordinates
        relative to the center of the circle.
        """
        while True:
            u = random.random()
            v = random.random()
            # Get random radius (R) and angle (Theta)
            r = self.radius * math.sqrt(u)  # Scaling radius
            theta = 2 * math.pi * v  # Full circle
            
            # Convert polar to cartesian coordinates with offset by center
            x = self.x_center + r * math.cos(theta)
            y = self.y_center + r * math.sin(theta)
            return [x, y]

# Example
# solution = Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
# print(solution.randPoint())  # Outputs something like: [-0.02493, -0.38077]
# print(solution.randPoint())  # Outputs something like: [0.82314, 0.38945]
# print(solution.randPoint())  # Outputs something like: [0.36572, 0.17248]

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:** The `__init__` method initializes the class by storing the radius and the x and y coordinates of the circle’s center.
2. **Generating a Random Point:** The `randPoint` method first generates two independent random numbers `u` and `v`. It scales `u` by taking the square root to maintain uniform distribution within the circle (this corrects the distribution density — areas closer to the center should be less dense). The angle `theta` is calculated by scaling `v` to cover a full circle (`2 * pi`). Scaling the radius with sqrt and multiplying the angle by `2 * pi` allows conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates.
3. **Conversion and Translation:** Converting these polar coordinates `(r, theta)` to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`, and then translating those coordinates to the circle’s actual center at `(x_center, y_center)` produces the final point. 
4. **Why No Rejection Method here?** The method above does not use rejection sampling (generating points uniformly in a bounding box and discarding those outside the circle) which can be inefficient and slow for large radius values, especially if multiple points are needed. The direct generation via polar coordinates is more efficient.

You can directly run this code in the Python3 environment on LeetCode with any required modifications to match their specific system details or interactive test case setups.

# 483. Smallest Good Base

### Problem Description 
For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1.

Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of n in string format.


Example 1:
Input: "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.


Example 2:
Input: "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.


Example 3:
Input: "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.

Note:
The range of n is [3, 10^18].

The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base for a given number \( n \) such that when \( n \) is represented in that base, all its digits are 1. This can be formulated as finding the smallest \( k \) such that:
\[ n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + \ldots + k^m \]
This is a geometric series and can be summed up to:
\[ n = \frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \]

Given the constraints, a brute force approach is not feasible. Instead, we should start by determining the possible values for \( m \) (the number of 1's in the representation). The highest value for \( m \) can be guessed based on the size of \( n \), since \( 1 + k + k^2 + \ldots + k^m \) grows very quickly with increasing \( m \).

### Key Points:
1. **Reduce the problem size using maximum \( m \)**: Start by trying smaller values of \( m \) (representing a deeper base). Larger \( m \) means a smaller base, so starting with large values for \( m \) lets us find the smallest base sooner.
2. **Iteratively test feasible bases**: For each \( m \), compute the possible base \( k \) using the geometric sum formula rearranged:
\[ k = \left\lfloor \sqrt[m]{\frac{n(k - 1) + 1}{k}} \right\rfloor \]
Check if \( k \) truly results in all digits being 1 for the base representation.
3. **Optimization by algebra**: Algebraically determining \( k \) from above can speed up the process, focusing on checking the feasible bases.
4. **Minimize search space**: We can halt the search once \( k \) doesn't change between iterations.

Given the value constraints in the problem statement, the code should handle very large numbers, hence using Python's inherent big integer operations will be helpful.

Let's implement this efficient approach.



```python
class Solution:
    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: str) -> str:
        n = int(n)
        max_m = int(math.log(n, 2))  # upper bound of m because 2 is the smallest base

        for m in range(max_m, 1, -1):  # start from max_m down to 2
            k = int(n ** (1.0 / m))
            if (k ** (m + 1) - 1) // (k - 1) == n:
                return str(k)

        return str(n - 1)  # If no valid k found, the answer is n-1 (base n - 1), for m = 1.

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.smallestGoodBase("13"))            # Output: "3"
print(sol.smallestGoodBase("4681"))          # Output: "8"
print(sol.smallestGoodBase("1000000000000000000"))   # Output: "999999999999999999"

```

### Explanation:
- The function `smallestGoodBase` converts the input to an integer.
- It works from `max_m` downwards. `max_m` is computed as the log to the base 2 of \( n \) rounded down.
- For each \( m \), compute \( k \) as the \( m \)-th root of \( n \) and check if setting \( k \) results in \( n = \frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \).
- If not found, return `n-1`, which is the base would be the just the number \( n \) with one less represented as one single `1` followed by a long sequence of zeros in binary (base 2).

This code performs efficiently under the constraints provided and should be able to handle very large numbers due to Python's handling of arbitrary-precision integers.

# 507. Perfect Number

### Problem Description 
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. A divisor of an integer `x` is an integer that can divide `x` evenly.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is a perfect number, otherwise return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: num = 28
Output: true
Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 are all divisors of 28.


Example 2:
Input: num = 6
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: num = 496
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: num = 8128
Output: true

Example 5:
Input: num = 2
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= num <= 108`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem efficiently, we can take advantage of the properties of divisors. When finding divisors, instead of iterating all the way to `num - 1`, we only need to check up to the square root of the number, because divisors come in pairs. For example, if `d` is a divisor of `num`, then `num/d` is also a divisor. When we find such a divisor `d` (where `d` divides `num`), we can add both `d` and `num/d` to our sum of divisors, being careful not to add `num` itself (as the problem description excludes the number itself).

The code can be structured as:
- A special case at the start to handle `num == 1`. Since the only divisor of 1 is itself and we can't include it, `1` is not a perfect number.
- Iterate from `2` up to `sqrt(num)` to find divisors, adding both `d` and `num/d` to a running sum whenever `d` divides `num` evenly.
- After the loop, if the accumulated sum of proper divisors equals `num`, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.



```python
class Solution:
    def checkPerfectNumber(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        
        sum_divisors = 1
        sqrt_num = int(num ** 0.5)
        
        for i in range(2, sqrt_num + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                sum_divisors += i
                if i != num // i:
                    sum_divisors += num // i
        
        return sum_divisors == num

# Example usage (this block will not be part of the submission on LeetCode)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.checkPerfectNumber(28))  # Output: true
    print(sol.checkPerfectNumber(6))   # Output: true
    print(sol.checkPerfectNumber(496)) # Output: true
    print(sol.checkPerfectNumber(8128))# Output: true
    print(sol.checkPerfectNumber(2))   # Output: false

```

This solution has a time complexity of approximately \(O(\sqrt{n})\), which is efficient given the constraints. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size. This code should work efficiently within the constraints provided by the problem (`1 <= num <= 10^8`).

# 517. Super Washing Machines

### Problem Description 
You have n super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty. 
For each move, you could choose any m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) washing machines, and pass one dress of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines  at the same time .  
Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible to do it, return -1.


Example1
Input: [1,0,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st move:    1     0 <-- 5    =>    1     1     4
2nd move:    1 <-- 1 <-- 4    =>    2     1     3    
3rd move:    2     1 <-- 3    =>    2     2     2   

Example2
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
1st move:    0 <-- 3     0    =>    1     2     0    
2nd move:    1     2 --> 0    =>    1     1     1     

Example3
Input: [0,2,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
It's impossible to make all the three washing machines have the same number of dresses. 
Note:
The range of n is [1, 10000].

The range of dresses number in a super washing machine is [0, 1e5].

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of balancing the dresses among washing machines, we can break it down by considering the flow of dresses in and out of each washing machine in terms of the net gain or loss needed for each machine.

Here are the steps to develop an optimized solution:

1. **Check Feasibility**: First, check if it's possible to balance the dresses at all. The sum of all dresses must be divisible by the number of machines to have an equal number in each.
2. **Calculate the Average**: Determine the average number of dresses each machine should have after balancing. This is simply the total dresses divided by the number of machines.
3. **Determine Exchanges**: Iterate through the machines and compute the load difference for each (i.e., current dresses minus the average). This differential dictates whether a machine needs to pass dresses to its neighbors (if positive) or receive from its neighbors (if negative). Keep track of the total excess dresses that have passed through each machine at different positions.
4. **Calculate Moves**: For each machine, the number of moves required is the maximum of the absolute incoming and outgoing dresses at that point. The globally required moves will be the maximum value observed throughout the series.

Using the above approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the given constraints comfortably. Now let's implement this in Python:



```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMinMoves(self, machines):
        """
        :type machines: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        total_dresses = sum(machines)
        n = len(machines)
        
        if total_dresses % n != 0:
            return -1
        
        target = total_dresses // n
        max_moves = 0
        running_diff = 0
        
        for dresses in machines:
            diff = dresses - target
            running_diff += diff
            max_moves = max(max_moves, abs(running_diff), diff)
        
        return max_moves

# Example Usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findMinMoves([1, 0, 5]))  # Output: 3
print(sol.findMinMoves([0, 3, 0]))  # Output: 2
print(sol.findMinMoves([0, 2, 0]))  # Output: -1

```

This Python code defines a solution class in a LeetCode-friendly structure, implementing a method to find the minimum number of moves to balance dresses between washing machines. By following the steps outlined, the function computes the moves efficiently and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

# 523. Continuous Subarray Sum

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, or `false` otherwise.

An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is always a multiple of `k`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42.

42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 13
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 105`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
`0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 231 - 1`
`1 <= k <= 231 - 1`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can use the prefix sum technique along with an important observation around modular arithmetic.
 
Key idea:
- The sum of elements from index i to j (`sum[i:j+1]`) in the array can be represented as `prefixSum[j+1] - prefixSum[i]`, where `prefixSum[x]` is the sum of all elements up to index `x-1`.
- A subarray's sum is divisible by `k` if `(prefixSum[j+1] - prefixSum[i]) % k == 0`.
  Translating this condition, it's equivalent to saying `prefixSum[j+1] % k == prefixSum[i] % k`.
  
Using this observation, we can keep track of mods and their indices:
- As we calculate the prefix sums while iterating through the array, compute `mod = prefixSum[i] % k`.
- If the same `mod` value re-appears, it means there exists some subarray sum that is divisible by `k`.

Steps:
1. Use a hashmap (`mods`) to remember the earliest index of each `mod` value.
2. Iterate through the array, for each index `i`, update the prefix sum and compute the `mod` value.
3. Check if the `mod` value exists in the hashmap:
   - If it exists and the distance to the previous occurrence is at least 1, it indicates the required subarray exists.
4. Handle negative mods using `(mod + k) % k` to ensure all mods stay in the positive domain, as Python handles negative mod differently.

Using this approach, we can determine if such a subarray exists in O(n) time complexity and space complexity.

This solution works correctly even when `k` is negative, since `-n % k` still conforms to the same logic as `((n % k) + k) % k`. Here's the implementation:



```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # HashMap to store the first occurrence of each mod value
        mods = {0: -1}  # Start with mod 0 at index -1 to handle perfect division at some prefix
        prefix_sum = 0
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            prefix_sum += num
            mod = prefix_sum % k
            
            if mod not in mods:
                mods[mod] = i  # Store the index for this mod
            elif i - mods[mod] > 1:
                # If the same mod was seen before at a distance more than one, then we found the subarray
                return True
        
        return False


```

In the example test cases, this code will efficiently verify if there exists a subarray with the sum divisible by `k` by leveraging the mod operations and hashmap to store indices of past mod results. This approach ensures a direct and efficient check without having to explicitly calculate the sum for every possible subarray, which would be infeasible given the input constraints.

# 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

### Problem Description 
Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

### Solution 
 Certainly! Below is a Python solution that implements the functionality of a TinyURL encoding and decoding service. This solution uses a simple mapping approach by using two dictionaries to map long URLs to short URLs and vice versa. We'll use a counter to generate unique short URLs. 

This is a straightforward implementation that works well within the constraints given. Note that the solution presented is primarily for educational purposes and lacks various real-world considerations like handling extremely large numbers of URLs, concurrency issues, distributed environment deployment, data persistence, and more.



```python
class Codec:
    def __init__(self):
        self.url_to_code = {}
        self.code_to_url = {}
        self.counter = 0
        
    def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
        """Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        :type longUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        if longUrl in self.url_to_code:
            return "http://tinyurl.com/" + self.url_to_code[longUrl]
        
        # Assign a new code to this URL
        code = str(self.counter)
        self.url_to_code[longUrl] = code
        self.code_to_url[code] = longUrl
        self.counter += 1
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + code

    def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
        """Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        :type shortUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Extract code from the short URL
        code = shortUrl.split('/')[-1]
        return self.code_to_url.get(code, None)

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
    - `__init__`: Initiate two dictionaries, `url_to_code` to map original URLs to unique codes and `code_to_url` to map back those codes to original URLs. Also, maintain a counter to generate unique codes.

2. **Encoding**:
    - `encode` function receives a `longUrl` and checks if it's already encoded. If yes, returns the existing short URL. 
    - If it's a new URL, increments the `counter` to generate a unique code, maps the URL to this new code and vice versa, and then returns the constructed short URL using the base `http://tinyurl.com/`.

3. **Decoding**:
    - `decode` function receives a `shortUrl`, extracts the last segment (the code) after the last slash, and retrieves the corresponding long URL from the `code_to_url` dictionary using this code.

This solution can be readily executed on LeetCode and provides an easy-to-understand example of how a URL shortening service can be implemented in Python. The counter-based approach ensures unique short URLs for different long URLs. For actual deployment, you would need a more robust method of generating codes and managing URL mappings (possibly involving databases and handling collisions in a scalable way).

# 537. Complex Number Multiplication

### Problem Description 
Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.


Example 1:
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.


Example 2:
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

Note:
The input strings will not have extra blank.

The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of multiplying two complex numbers represented as strings, we must:

1. Parse each part of the complex numbers from the strings.
2. Apply the mathematical rules of complex multiplication.
3. Convert the result back to the string format.

In detail:
- **Parsing:** Given a string "a+bi" or "a+-bi", the real part is `a`, and the imaginary part is `b`. We can achieve this by splitting the string.
- **Complex multiplication:** For two complex numbers `(a+bi)` and `(c+di)`, their product is `(a*c - b*d) + (a*d + b*c)i`.
- **Constructing result string:** Follow the format to combine real and imaginary results into the target string format.

Using these principles, the solution can be implemented as follows:



```python
class Solution:
    def complexNumberMultiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        # Function to parse a complex number string
        def parse_complex(num):
            # Remove 'i' and split at '+', account for '-'
            if '+' in num:
                a, b = num[:-1].split('+')
            else:
                num = num[:-1]
                minus_pos = num.rfind('-')
                a = num[:minus_pos]
                b = num[minus_pos:]
            return int(a), int(b)
        
        # Parse both numbers
        a, b = parse_complex(num1)
        c, d = parse_complex(num2)
        
        # Multiply complex numbers
        real = a * c - b * d  # Real part: ac - bd
        imag = a * d + b * c  # Imaginary part: ad + bc
        
        # Return the result in the desired format
        return f"{real}+{imag}i"

# Test the solution using the examples
sol = Solution()
print(sol.complexNumberMultiply("1+1i", "1+1i"))  # Output: "0+2i"
print(sol.complexNumberMultiply("1+-1i", "1+-1i"))  # Output: "0+-2i"

```

This code first defines a utility function to parse the complex number from its string form by removing 'i' and splitting around the '+' or handling '-' accordingly. It then multiplies the components of these parsed numbers following the rules of complex multiplication and prepares the output in the defined format, combining the real and imaginary parts appropriately. This solution is efficient and straightforward for the given problem constraints.

# 553. Optimal Division

### Problem Description 
Given a list of positive integers, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.


Example:
Input: [1000,100,10,2]
Output: "1000/(100/10/2)"
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in "1000/((100/10)/2)" are redundant, since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return "1000/(100/10/2)". 
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2
Note:
The length of the input array is [1, 10].

Elements in the given array will be in range [2, 1000].

There is only one optimal division for each test case.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem on LeetCode, you need to understand the mathematical implications of division and how parenthesis changes it. Given the constraints and nature of divide operation, to maximize the quotient under the given conditions, you have to make the dividend as large as possible and the divisor as small as possible.

If the input list has:
- Only one number, just return that number as a string.
- Two numbers, simply return them divided in the usual order (`a/b`).
- More than two numbers, you can always maximize the result by keeping the first number as is and dividing it by the result of the minimum value achieved by the rest of the numbers. This can be done by setting parenthesis around all the remaining elements and letting them form the smallest possible divisor.

In practical terms, for an array `[a, b, c, d, ...]`, the result maximizing format would be: 

    a / (b / c / d / ...)

This form ensures 'a' remains large and the grouped division of all other elements forms a smaller divisor.

Now, here is the fully functional Python code based on the LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def optimalDivision(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return str(nums[0])
        elif len(nums) == 2:
            return f"{nums[0]}/{nums[1]}"
        else:
            nums = list(map(str, nums))  # Convert all integers to str for easy joining
            return f"{nums[0]}/({'/'.join(nums[1:])})"

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.optimalDivision([1000, 100, 10, 2]))  # Output: "1000/(100/10/2)"

```

- `nums = list(map(str, nums))`: Converts each integer in the list to a string, preparing it for use in the result expression.
- `"{'/'.join(nums[1:])}"`: Joins all the elements from the second to the last with '/' in-between. This collectively forms the divisor.

This solution ensures clear and direct formation of the required mathematical expression and works within the specified constraints efficiently.

# 573. Squirrel Simulation

### Problem Description 
There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid. Your goal is to find the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.


Example 1:
Input: 
Height : 5
Width : 7
Tree position : [2,2]
Squirrel : [4,4]
Nuts : [[3,0], [2,5]]
Output: 12
Explanation:
​​​​​
Note:
All given positions won't overlap.

The squirrel can take at most one nut at one time.

The given positions of nuts have no order.

Height and width are positive integers. 3 <= height * width <= 10,000.

The given positions contain at least one nut, only one tree and one squirrel.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we'll aim to minimize the total path the squirrel takes to collect all the nuts and deliver them to the tree. We need to consider that movement from one point to another requires the squirrel to move horizontally and vertically, which suggests using the Manhattan distance as the metric.

The core idea revolves around recognizing that the typical scenario where trees collect nuts involves a direct assemblage of round trips from the tree to each nut. However, the squirrel starts at a different position (not at the tree), so just one nut-fetch operation will begin from the squirrel's starting position and end at the tree. For this nut, the cost saved is defined by how much shorter the trip is when starting from the squirrel's initial position compared to starting at the tree.

Algorithm:
1. Calculate the traditional total distance if the squirrel were to start from the tree for each nut and double it (going to the nut and coming back).
2. For each nut, calculate the distance if the first trip was from the squirrel's start position to the nut and from the nut to the tree.
3. The effective saving for using the squirrel's start position for a nut is the difference between the direct squirrel start-to-nut/treetrip and the typical tree-nut-tree trip.
4. Calculate this saving for each nut, and determine the maximum savings possible.
5. Subtract this maximum saving from the 'normal' total to get the minimal total distance.

Here's the implementation of the above logic:



```python
def minDistance(height, width, tree, squirrel, nuts):
    def manhattan(p1, p2):
        return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])

    nut_to_tree_total = 0

    # Calculate the normal gathering total where all trips are round-trip from tree
    for nut in nuts:
        nut_to_tree_total += 2 * manhattan(nut, tree)

    # Now calculate the potential savings if squirrel starts from its position
    max_savings = float('-inf')
    for nut in nuts:
        # Normal round trip from the tree to nuts and back
        tree_nut_tree = 2 * manhattan(nut, tree)
        # Squirrel start to nut, then nut to tree
        squirrel_nut_tree = manhattan(squirrel, nut) + manhattan(nut, tree)
        # Savings is the difference
        savings = tree_nut_tree - squirrel_nut_tree
        # We are looking for the maximum savings
        max_savings = max(max_savings, savings)
    
    # Calculate minimal total distance with best savings spot
    min_total_distance = nut_to_tree_total - max_savings

    return min_total_distance

# Example usage
print(minDistance(5, 7, [2, 2], [4, 4], [[3, 0], [2, 5]]))  # Output should be 12

```

### Explanation of the example:
1. Both nuts are at `[[3, 0], [2, 5]]`.
2. Without optimization:
   - Nut at `3,0`: Trip to nut and back to tree: `2 * (2+2) = 8`.
   - Nut at `2,5`: Trip to nut and back to tree: `2 * (0+3) = 6`.
   - Total = 8 + 6 = 14.
3. Considering the squirrel's start position allows us to save more if it starts by fetching either of these nuts.
4. Calculating for optimization:
   - Starting with nut `3,0` saves more: `8 - (2+3) = 3`.
   - Starting with nut `2,5`: `6 - (1+3) = 2`.
5. Thus, the best savings is by fetching `3,0` first, reducing the `8` cost trip to `5`.
6. Therefore, the total becomes 14 - 3 = 12.

This function should directly work on any platform that supports Python execution, provided the input constraints adhere to the problem statement (positions within the defined grid, nuts are points in the list, etc.). The above implementation follows the typical format expected on competitive programming sites like LeetCode.

# 592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction

### Problem Description 
Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, say `2`, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator `1`. So in this case, `2` should be converted to `2/1`.


Example 1:
Input:"-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"

Example 2:
Input:"-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"

Example 3:
Input:"1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"

Example 4:
Input:"5/3+1/3"
Output: "2/1"
Note:
The input string only contains `'0'` to `'9'`, `'/'`, `'+'` and `'-'`. So does the output.

Each fraction (input and output) has format `±numerator/denominator`. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then `'+'` will be omitted.

The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1,10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.

The number of given fractions will be in the range [1,10].

The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of adding and subtracting fractions given in a string, we need to carefully parse the string, compute the fractions, and simplify the final result. Key steps in the program include:

1. Parsing the input string to extract individual fractions and corresponding operations.
2. Converting these fractions to a common denominator and then summing them up.
3. Reducing the resulting fraction to its simplest form using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
4. Formatting the output as specified.

We can use Python's built-in `math.gcd` function to compute the GCD, which will help in simplifying the fractions. For handling fractions, we can maintain the numerator and denominator throughout the operations.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:



```python
from math import gcd

class Solution:
    def fractionAddition(self, expression: str) -> str:
        # Import the greatest common divisor function
        from math import gcd
        
        # Initialize numerator and denominator
        numerator, denominator = 0, 1
        
        # Iterate through each fraction in expression
        i = 0
        while i < len(expression):
            # Read the numerator
            numStart = i
            if expression[i] in '+-':
                i += 1
            while expression[i] != '/':
                i += 1
            num = int(expression[numStart:i])
            
            # Read the denominator
            i += 1
            denomStart = i
            while i < len(expression) and (expression[i].isdigit() or expression[i] in '+-'):
                if expression[i] in '+-': break
                i += 1
            denom = int(expression[denomStart:i])
            
            # Now, add or subtract the fraction (num/denom)
            numerator = numerator * denom + num * denominator
            denominator *= denom
            
            # Reduce to the minimal form during the process
            common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)
            numerator //= common_divisor
            denominator //= common_divisor
        
        # Format output
        return f"{numerator}/{denominator}"
        
# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2"))  # Output: "0/1"
print(sol.fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2+1/3"))  # Output: "1/3"
print(sol.fractionAddition("1/3-1/2"))  # Output: "-1/6"
print(sol.fractionAddition("5/3+1/3"))  # Output: "2/1"

```

### Explanation of Solution:

- **Parsing**: We parse the expression character by character, extracting numerators and denominators while handling possible sign changes.
- **Fraction Calculation**: In each iteration, based on the text extraction, we adjust the `numerator` and `denominator` to include the addition or subtraction of the current fraction.
- **Simplification**: Via the `gcd` function, we constantly simplify the current result to ensure no overflow and maintain simpler forms.
- **Final Output**: We format the result as a string `numerator/denominator`. If the fraction reduces to an integer, it will correctly show with `/1` as per requirements. 

This implementation allows us to flexibly handle the addition and subtraction of any number of fractions input in a single string while securely managing the arithmetic to prevent errors and ensure proper format.

# 593. Valid Square

### Problem Description 
Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space `p1`, `p2`, `p3` and `p4`, return `true` if the four points construct a square.

The coordinate of a point `pi` is represented as `[xi, yi]`. The input is not given in any order.

A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).


Example 1:
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,12]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p1 = [1,0], p2 = [-1,0], p3 = [0,1], p4 = [0,-1]
Output: true

Constraints:
`p1.length == p2.length == p3.length == p4.length == 2`
`-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`

### Solution 
 To determine whether four given points in 2D space form a square, the following approach can be adopted:

1. **Calculate Distances**: Compute the squared Euclidean distance between each pair of the points. This avoids floating point inaccuracies that are inherent with square roots and the resultant distances are easily comparable.

2. **Identify Unique Distances**: For the set of points to form a square, the set of computed distances must contain only two unique elements:
   - Four smaller distances (sides of the square) of equal length.
   - Two larger distances (diagonals of the square) of equal length, and each diagonal should be exactly `sqrt(2)` times a side (which when squared, is twice the length of a squared side).

3. **Validate Distances**: Check that there are four occurrences of the smaller distance and two occurrences of the larger one. Furthermore, the larger distance should be exactly twice the smaller distance for the geometry to qualify as a square.

With this approach, the task breaks down into a manageable series of simple checks.



```python
class Solution:
    def validSquare(self, p1, p2, p3, p4):
        def dist(p, q):
            return (p[0] - q[0]) ** 2 + (p[1] - q[1]) ** 2

        # List all combinations of point pairs and their distances
        distances = [
            dist(p1, p2), dist(p1, p3), dist(p1, p4),
            dist(p2, p3), dist(p2, p4), dist(p3, p4)
        ]

        # Using a frequency map to count occurrences of distances
        distance_count = {}
        for d in distances:
            if d in distance_count:
                distance_count[d] += 1
            else:
                distance_count[d] = 1

        # Expected: one should appear 4 times, the other should appear 2 times
        values = list(distance_count.values())
        keys = list(distance_count.keys())

        # There should be exactly two unique distances
        if len(keys) != 2:
            return False
        
        # Find which is side and which is diagonal
        if values[0] == 4 and values[1] == 2:
            side = keys[0]
            diagonal = keys[1]
        elif values[1] == 4 and values[0] == 2:
            side = keys[1]
            diagonal = keys[0]
        else:
            return False

        # Check the relationship between the side and diagonal
        return diagonal == 2 * side

# This can be run as follows:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.validSquare([0,0], [1,1], [1,0], [0,1]))  # Output: true
print(sol.validSquare([0,0], [1,1], [1,0], [0,12])) # Output: false
print(sol.validSquare([1,0], [-1,0], [0,1], [0,-1])) # Output: true

```

This code should run correctly on the LeetCode platform, as it systematically computes crucial distances between the given points, checks the necessary conditions for these distances, and validates whether they meet the criteria for forming a square.

# 598. Range Addition II

### Problem Description 
You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and an array of operations `ops`, where `ops[i] = [ai, bi]` means `M[x][y]` should be incremented by one for all `0 <= x < ai` and `0 <= y < bi`.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.


Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.


Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9

Constraints:
`1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104`
`1 <= ops.length <= 104`
`ops[i].length == 2`
`1 <= ai <= m`
`1 <= bi <= n`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we can use an optimized approach leveraging the properties of the operations array `ops`. Notably, for each operation `[ai, bi]` in `ops`, `M[x][y]` is incremented for all `(0 <= x < ai)` and `(0 <= y < bi)`. 

**Key insight**: 
From the operation description, it's clear that only the top-left part of the matrix (bounded by the smallest values of `ai` and `bi`) is getting incremented consistently with every operation. In other words, the maximum number in the matrix depends only on the smallest values of `ai` and `bi` across all operations.

**Optimized Approach**:
1. Identify the smallest `ai` value across all operations (denote this as `min_a`).
2. Identify the smallest `bi` value across all operations (denote this as `min_b`).
3. The top-left submatrix defined by `min_a x min_b` will be the region that gets incremented the most.
4. The count of maximum integers is the product of `min_a` and `min_b` since every cell in this `min_a x min_b` region will be incremented the same maximum number of times.

**Special case**: If `ops` is empty, there are no increment operations, hence the entire matrix remains at zero, and the maximum value (0) appears `m * n` times.

Below is a direct implementation in Python which is suitable for testing on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not ops:
            return m * n
            
        min_a = min(op[0] for op in ops)
        min_b = min(op[1] for op in ops)
        
        return min_a * min_b

```

This solution is highly efficient, as it simply traverses the operations list once to find the `min_a` and `min_b`. It thus operates in O(k) time, where k is the number of operations, and uses O(1) additional space, making it optimal for given constraints.

This code can be directly run on LeetCode and should work properly for provided input constraints and formats as noted in the problem description.

# 625. Minimum Factorization

### Problem Description 
Given a positive integer `a`, find the smallest positive integer `b` whose multiplication of each digit equals to `a`. 
If there is no answer or the answer is not fit in 32-bit signed integer, then return 0.


Example 1
Input:
48 
Output:
68

Example 2
Input: 
15
Output:
35

### Solution 
 The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer `b` such that the product of its digits is equal to `a`. If `b` exceeds the range of a 32-bit signed integer or if it's not possible, the solution should return 0.

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Check edge cases**: If `a` is 1, the smallest integer is also 1. If `a` is 0, return 0 since no product of positive integers can result in 0.

2. **Factorization Method**:
    - Since the integer `b` should consist of the smallest possible digits, start by trying to factorize `a` using the largest possible small digits, from 9 to 2.
    - Continue dividing `a` by these digits in descending order until `a` becomes 1 or cannot be further divided among these digits.

3. **Constructing b**:
    - For each successful division, prepend that digit to `b` because prepending smaller digits will keep `b` smaller.
    - If at any point, `a` cannot be fully divided into these digits, return 0.

4. **Check for 32-bit overflow**: Once `b` is constructed, check if `b` lies within the 32-bit signed integer range.

Here's a suitable Python code for handling this:



```python
class Solution:
    def smallestFactorization(self, a: int) -> int:
        if a < 2:
            return a
        
        # Start factorizing from the largest to smallest digits
        digits = []
        for factor in range(9, 1, -1):
            while a % factor == 0:
                a //= factor
                digits.append(factor)
        
        # If the a is not reduced to 1, then it's not possible to factorize `a` using the digits 1-9
        if a != 1:
            return 0
        
        # Forming the number `b`
        b = 0
        while digits:
            b = b * 10 + digits.pop()
        
        # Check for 32-bit signed integer overflow
        if b > 2**31 - 1:
            return 0
        return b

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.smallestFactorization(48))  # Output: 68
# print(sol.smallestFactorization(15))  # Output: 35

```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `smallestFactorization` which implements the logic described.
1. The `factors` loop iteratively reduces `a` by dividing it with digits from 9 to 2.
2. If `a` cannot be reduced to 1, the function returns 0 as it's impossible to decompose `a` into the required product form.
3. The number `b` is constructed by leveraging the property that smaller	numbers should appear later in `b` to keep `b` minimized.
4. Overflow checks ensure compliance with the 32-bit signed integer limit.

This implementation works directly on LeetCode and accounts for edge cases along with the constraints given.

# 628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers

### Problem Description 
Given an integer array `nums`, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24

Example 3:
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3]
Output: -6

Constraints:
`3 <= nums.length <= 104`
`-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

### Solution 
 Given the problem description provided, the solution involves calculating the maximum product of any three integers from the given list `nums`. Since the values can both be negative and positive, there are mainly two situations where the maximum product can be obtained:
1. The product of the three largest numbers in the list.
2. The product of the two smallest numbers (most negative) and the largest number.

The second situation leverages the mathematical property that the product of two negative numbers is positive, and thus, multiplying these with the largest positive number may yield a higher product.

The approach to solve the problem is straightforward:
- Sort the list.
- Compare the product of the three largest numbers with the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number.
- Return the maximum of these two products.

Here is the corresponding Python function to calculate this, which fits the format for a solution used in LeetCode, including a class and static method.



```python
class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # First, the nums list is sorted
        nums.sort()
        
        # Possible choice 1: Product of the three largest numbers
        max1 = nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3]
        
        # Possible choice 2: Product of two smallest and the largest number
        max2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1]
        
        # The maximum of these two choices is the result
        return max(max1, max2)

# To run the solution 
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maximumProduct([1, 2, 3]))    # Output: 6
print(sol.maximumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])) # Output: 24
print(sol.maximumProduct([-1, -2, -3])) # Output: -6

```

This Python class `Solution` defines a method `maximumProduct`, which takes in a list `nums` and outputs the maximum product of any three integers from that list as per the described logic. The code is formatted to be directly usable in LeetCode's coding environment. The bottom part of the code demonstrates how you might run the function with example inputs.

# 633. Sum of Square Numbers

### Problem Description 
Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there're two integers `a` and `b` such that `a2 + b2 = c`.


Example 1:
Input: c = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

Example 2:
Input: c = 3
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: c = 4
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: c = 2
Output: true

Example 5:
Input: c = 1
Output: true

Constraints:
`0 <= c <= 231 - 1`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding two integers `a` and `b` such that \(a^2 + b^2 = c\), where `c` is a non-negative integer, we can use the two-pointer technique.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialize pointers**: Set one pointer `a` starting at `0` and another pointer `b` which is the integer value of the square root of `c`. This is because `a^2` or `b^2` should not exceed `c`.

2. **Iterate using two pointers**: Utilize the following rules inside a loop:
   - Calculate the sum of squares `a^2 + b^2`.
   - If the sum equals `c`, return `True` since we've found such a `a` and `b`.
   - If the sum is greater than `c`, decrement `b` to decrease the sum.
   - If the sum is less than `c`, increment `a` to increase the sum.
   
3. **End loop**: If `a` surpasses `b`, and we haven't found such a pair, return `False`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{c})\) since in the worst case, the pointer `a` has to iterate from `0` to approximately \(\sqrt{c}\).

### Code:

Here's how you can write this in a LeetCode-compliant way:



```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        # Initializing two pointers
        a = 0
        b = int(c**0.5)
        
        # Loop until `a` exceed `b`
        while a <= b:
            current_sum = a*a + b*b
            # Check if we found the solution
            if current_sum == c:
                return True
            elif current_sum < c:
                a += 1
            else:
                b -= 1
        
        return False

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.judgeSquareSum(5))  # Output: True
print(sol.judgeSquareSum(3))  # Output: False
print(sol.judgeSquareSum(4))  # Output: True
print(sol.judgeSquareSum(2))  # Output: True
print(sol.judgeSquareSum(1))  # Output: True

```

### Explanation with an Example:

For `c = 5`:
- Initialize `a = 0` and `b = 2` (since \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236\))
- Check the sum of squares:
  - For \(a = 0\) and \(b = 2\): \(0^2 + 2^2 = 4\) which is less than 5, increment `a`.
  - For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\): \(1^2 + 2^2 = 5\) which equals 5, hence return `True`.
  
The logic efficiently utilizes the two-pointers technique to narrow down the possible values for `a` and `b` quickly.

# 634. Find the Derangement of An Array

### Problem Description 
In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of `n` integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].

Note:
`n` is in the range of [1, 106].

### Solution 
 The problem you're tackling is to count the number of derangements, which are permutations where no element appears in its original position, for an array of size `n`.

To solve this problem, we leverage dynamic programming. Let's denote `D(n)` as the number of derangements possible for an array of size `n`. Using well-known combinatorial identities, `D(n)` can be related to its previous states using the following recursive relation:

\[ D(n) = (n-1) \times (D(n-1) + D(n-2)) \]

The derivations of this formula are based on considering element placement choices:
- The first element can be placed in any of the `n-1` positions. Suppose we place element 1 in position k (where k > 1). Now:
  - Element k can go into position 1, which leads to `D(n-2)` derangements for the remaining `n-2` elements.
  - Or, element k does not go to position 1. Here, we need to find a derangement for the remaining `n-1` elements after fixing element k, which leads to `D(n-1)` derangements.

Given the recursion, we can see that to compute `D(n)`, we will only need the values of `D(n-1)` and `D(n-2)`. We can store these in a dynamic programming table or optimize further to constant space by storing only the last two relevant values.

Here's how you could write this in Python to fit into the LeetCode answer format:



```python
class Solution:
    def findDerangement(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        if n == 2:
            return 1

        # Using a table to store results to avoid recomputation
        # Space optimized, keeping only the last two relevant values
        last_two = [0, 1]  # Base cases: D(1)=0, D(2)=1
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            # the current value is computed based on the last two values
            current = ((i - 1) * (last_two[0] + last_two[1])) % MOD
            
            # update the last two elements
            last_two[0] = last_two[1]
            last_two[1] = current

        return last_two[1]

# For testing in LeetCode.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of the Solution class
    sol = Solution()
    # Example 1: Input: 3, Output: 2
    print(sol.findDerangement(3))  # Output should be 2

```

### Note:
1. The dynamic programming approach is both time and space efficient for this problem, especially with the space optimization applied.
2. The provided code handles very large values of `n`, up to 10^6 as required, and returns results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. The function follows the recursive relation outlined earlier with computed base cases and intermediate values stored efficiently.
4. There is no need to actually generate the derangements but simply to count them using combinatorial principles.
5. This solution is efficient enough for large inputs while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem statement.


# 640. Solve the Equation

### Problem Description 
Solve a given equation and return the value of `x` in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable `x` and its coefficient.

If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution".

If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions".

If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of `x` is an integer.


Example 1:
Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
Output: "x=2"

Example 2:
Input: "x=x"
Output: "Infinite solutions"

Example 3:
Input: "2x=x"
Output: "x=0"

Example 4:
Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2"
Output: "x=-1"

Example 5:
Input: "x=x+2"
Output: "No solution"

### Solution 
 Here we are solving a linear equation in the format of a string. The structure involves only addition and subtraction of terms along with the variable x.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
- Parse the equation and simplify the expression to the form `ax = b`, where `a` and `b` are integers.
- Calculate the total net coefficients of `x` and the constant values for both the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS).
- For the final result after reduction:
  - If `a = 0` and `b = 0`, all values of `x` satisfy the equation: return "Infinite solutions".
  - If `a = 0` and `b != 0`, there is no solution for the equation: return "No solution".
  - Otherwise, compute `x` as `x = -b/a`, ensuring we output an integer by dividing the constants.

Let's devise the code following this idea using Python:



```python
class Solution:
    def solveEquation(self, equation: str) -> str:
        lhs, rhs = equation.split('=')
        
        def simplify(side):
            # Initialize total counts for x and constants
            total_x = 0
            total_num = 0
            # Prepare to parse the side correctly by ensuring a clean split on '+' and '-'
            import re
            tokens = re.findall(r'([+-]?\d*x?)', side.replace('-', '+-'))
            for token in tokens:
                if 'x' in token:  # Variable token with 'x'
                    coef = token.replace('x', '')
                    coef = coef if coef and coef != '+' else '+1'   # Change '' or '+' to '+1'
                    coef = coef if coef != '-' else '-1'           # Change '-' to '-1'
                    total_x += int(coef)
                else:  # Number token
                    if token:
                        total_num += int(token)
            
            return total_x, total_num

        # Gather all x coefficients and numbers separately from both sides
        l_total_x, l_total_num = simplify(lhs)
        r_total_x, r_total_num = simplify(rhs)
        
        # Calculate net x coefficient and constant on moving all to one side
        net_x = l_total_x - r_total_x
        net_num = r_total_num - l_total_num
        
        # Decide the result based on the net coeffs
        if net_x == 0:
            if net_num == 0:
                return "Infinite solutions"
            else:
                return "No solution"
        else:
            # Solve x = -num/x_coef
            result = -net_num // net_x
            return f"x={result}"

# Sample usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.solveEquation("x+5-3+x=6+x-2"))  # Output: "x=2"
print(sol.solveEquation("x=x"))            # Output: "Infinite solutions"
print(sol.solveEquation("2x=x"))           # Output: "x=0"
print(sol.solveEquation("2x+3x-6x=x+2"))   # Output: "x=-1"
print(sol.solveEquation("x=x+2"))          # Output: "No solution"

```

This code uses simplification techniques to separate terms involving x and constant terms, uses a regular expression `re.findall` to capture both positive and negative terms conveniently, and finally solves or determines the nature of the solution based on the coefficients of `x`. The code uses only basic linear algebra principles and is designed to handle equations normally presented in high school algebra.

# 645. Set Mismatch

### Problem Description 
You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:
`2 <= nums.length <= 104`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of finding the duplicated number and the missing number in the set `nums`, we can employ a strategy of calculating the difference between the sums of the original `nums` array and the expected sum (sum of all numbers from `1` to `n`). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution approach:

1. **Calculate the Expected Sum**: Compute the sum from `1` to `n` using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`, where `n` is the length of the original array `nums`.

2. **Calculate the Observed Sum**: Sum all the elements present in the array `nums`.

3. **Difference between Observed Sum and Expected Sum**: This result will be missing number minus the duplicated number since the duplicated number adds excess to the sum while the missing number reduces it.

4. **Occurrence Check**: Use a set or a dictionary to discover which number occurs twice in the array.

5. **Calculate Missing Number**: Add the value of the duplicated number to the difference obtained in step 3. This gives the missing number, because duplicated minus missing equals the difference.

This solution is efficient as it does not require additional space proportional to `n` (a set or dictionary only holds elements seen in the array while iterating). The computational complexity is primarily `O(n)` due to the iterations over the array to compute sums and check for the duplicate.

Here's the LeetCode formatted solution following this method:



```python
class Solution:
    def findErrorNums(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        observed_sum = sum(nums)
        
        # To find the duplicate 
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                duplicate = num
                break
            seen.add(num)
        
        missing = expected_sum - (observed_sum - duplicate)
        return [duplicate, missing]


```
This solution involves:
- Calculating the expected sum which takes constant time `O(1)`.
- Calculating the observed sum and identifying the duplicate number, both of which require a single traversal of the array, thus `O(n)`.
- Calculating the missing number using the results from the above steps, which is `O(1)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity remains linear, i.e., `O(n)`, and the space complexity is `O(1)` beyond the input due to minimal use of additional storage.

# 651. 4 Keys Keyboard

### Problem Description 
Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys: 
`Key 1: (A)`:  Print one 'A' on screen.

`Key 2: (Ctrl-A)`: Select the whole screen.

`Key 3: (Ctrl-C)`: Copy selection to buffer.

`Key 4: (Ctrl-V)`: Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed. 
Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.


Example 1:
Input: N = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can at most get 3 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
A, A, A

Example 2:
Input: N = 7
Output: 9
Explanation: 
We can at most get 9 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
Note:
1 <= N <= 50 
Answers will be in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

### Solution 
 Here is a Python solution that can directly be used to solve the problem as described, formatted in a style suitable for submission on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def maxA(self, N: int) -> int:
        # dp[i] will store the maximum number of 'A's 
        # that can be printed with i keystrokes
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)
        
        # Process each number of allowed keystrokes from 1 to N
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            # The default operation: add a new 'A' by pressing 'A'
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1  
            
            # Consider all possible uses of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C followed by j-times Ctrl-V
            for j in range(1, i - 2):  # The minimum j is 1 because we need at least 3 keystrokes before (i.e., for 'A', 'Ctrl-A', 'Ctrl-C')
                # Maximize the use of remaining strokes after Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, and some Ctrl-Vs
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1))  # (i - j - 1) is how many times Ctrl-V can be pressed
            
        return dp[N]

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.maxA(3))  # Output: 3
    print(sol.maxA(7))  # Output: 9

```

### Explanation:
In this solution, we use Dynamic Programming to solve the problem. We define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed using `i` keystrokes.

1. **Base case**: When `i=1`, one keystroke can only print one 'A', so `dp[1]=1`.

2. **Transition**: For each `i` from 2 to `N`, we evaluate two main scenarios:
    - **Press the 'A' key**: This simply increases the count from the previous keystroke by one, hence `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`.
    - **Use sequence Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C and then multiple Ctrl-V**:
        - For choosing when to start using the Ctrl-V (after some initial 'A's, Ctrl-A, and Ctrl-C), iterate over `j` where `j` is index before `i`.
        - Calculate the number of 'A's if Ctrl-V is used `i-j-2` times (after using Ctrl-A and Ctrl-C).
        - `dp[j]` gives the number of 'A's before copying, multiply it by `(i-j-1)` which is how many times we effectively paste after copying. We compare it with the current `dp[i]` to decide the maximum.

3. After evaluating all `i` up to `N`, `dp[N]` will be our desired result.

This approach dynamically builds up the solution to the problem and provides an efficient way to determine the maximum number of 'A's that can be produced with a given number of keystrokes using the specified key sequence.

# 660. Remove 9

### Problem Description 
Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29...

So now, you will have a new integer sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...

Given a positive integer `n`, you need to return the n-th integer after removing. Note that 1 will be the first integer.


Example 1:
Input: n = 9
Output: 10

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 8 x 10^8`

### Solution 
 The problem requires us to find the `n`-th integer in a sequence where any number containing the digit '9' is excluded. To solve this problem efficiently, we can take advantage of the base number systems. 

Given that numbers containing the digit '9' are removed, this problem resembles counting numbers in base 9, because the numbers 1 through 8 in base 10 are equivalent to the numbers 1 through 8 in base 9. 

To find the `n`-th number in this new sequence:
1. Convert `n` from base 10 to base 9.
2. This base 9 representation directly gives the sequence number without the digit '9'.

For example, if `n` is 9 in base 10, it will be represented as 10 in base 9, but without the digit '9' involved. 

This approach is efficient because converting a number to a different base is computationally inexpensive, and the problem can avoid any iteration for counting, making it feasible even for large values of `n` up to `8 x 10^8`.

Let's implement this solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def newInteger(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        base = 1
        
        while n > 0:
            res += (n % 9) * base
            n //= 9
            base *= 10
            
        return res

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.newInteger(9))  # Output: 10 (which is the 9th number excluding numbers containing the digit '9')

```

This implementation defines a `Solution` class with the method `newInteger`, which takes an integer `n` and returns the `n`-th number in the sequence where any number containing '9' is removed. For each digit, it calculates its contribution in the output using its weight in base 10 (`base`). This is performed in a loop that divides `n` by 9 to traverse through all the significant positions in base 9, accumulating the result in base 10.

# 670. Maximum Swap

### Problem Description 
Given a non-negative integer, you could swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you could get.


Example 1:
Input: 2736
Output: 7236
Explanation: Swap the number 2 and the number 7.


Example 2:
Input: 9973
Output: 9973
Explanation: No swap.

Note:
The given number is in the range [0, 108]

### Solution 
 To address the problem of obtaining the maximum value from a number by swapping two of its digits at most once, we can use the following approach:

**Strategy**:
- Traverse each digit in the number and for each digit, try to find a greater digit that occurs later in the number to swap with.
- If swapping leads to a greater-value number, update our tracking of the best possible outcome.
- Use array representation of digits for easier manipulation and comparisons.

**Steps**:
- Convert the number to a string to easily access individual digits.
- Iterate over the digits and, for each digit, check against subsequent digits.
- If you find a bigger digit later in the sequence to swap with, keep track of this possible highest result and do the swap.
- Account for nuances like multiple swaps leading to higher numbers and identifying the right digits to swap.

**Edge Cases**:
- If the number is already the highest possible number it can be, we don't need to swap any digits.
- If the number is a single digit or all identical digits, there's also no swap needed.

Below is the complete solution coded to fit in a LeetCode submission:



```python
class Solution:
    def maximumSwap(self, num: int) -> int:
        num_str = list(str(num))
        n = len(num_str)
        max_num = num  # use this to keep track of the maximum obtained by swapping

        # Use this dict to record the last occurrence (index) of each digit 0-9
        last = {int(v): k for k, v in enumerate(num_str)}
        
        # Look through each digit, and consider the possibility of swapping it with all digits after it
        for i in range(n):
            for d in range(9, int(num_str[i]), -1):
                # d goes from 9 to current digit + 1 because we want a higher digit to swap
                if last.get(d, -1) > i:
                    # If there's a larger digit later in the array, we swap
                    num_str[i], num_str[last[d]] = num_str[last[d]], num_str[i]
                    max_num = max(max_num, int("".join(num_str)))
                    # Swap back after checking
                    num_str[i], num_str[last[d]] = num_str[last[d]], num_str[i]

        return max_num

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.maximumSwap(2736))  # Output: 7236
# print(sol.maximumSwap(9973))  # Output: 9973

```

This code is structured as a class `Solution` with a method `maximumSwap` that takes an integer `num` and returns an integer. It first converts the input number into a list of digit characters, then computes possible swaps using a dictionary that tracks the last index each digit appears at. The code looks for possible beneficial swaps (swapping current digit with a higher digit seen later), computes the potentially new maximum number, and updates accordingly. The procedure ensures that the swap leads to a maximized outcome based on the specified rules. The code is ready for direct submissions with LeetCode's Python environment.

# 672. Bulb Switcher II

### Problem Description 
There is a room with `n` lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly `m` unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the `n` lights could be.

Suppose `n` lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:
Flip all the lights.

Flip lights with even numbers.

Flip lights with odd numbers.

Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, m = 1.
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, m = 1.
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, m = 1.
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].

Note: `n` and `m` both fit in range [0, 1000].

### Solution 
 Here's a Python code solution for the problem described, which can be executed directly on the LeetCode platform. The solution includes a class with a method `flipLights`, which computes the number of unique light statuses that can be achieved after `m` operations on `n` lights as described.



```python
class Solution:
    def flipLights(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        # This problem mainly revolves around exploiting the patterns that emerge due to
        # the constraints of the operations. there are only a few lamps and their states are
        # influenced by at most 4 operations; this leads to a small set of unique patterns/states.

        # A few key observations:
        # - The order of the operations does not matter, only the parity (even or odd number of times an operation performed).
        # - Operations can overlap effectively cancelling each other.
        # - Only the first 3 lamps uniquely determine the pattern of all lamps for n > 3. Since the operations are periodic especially the (3k+1).

        if m == 0:
            return 1
        if n == 1:
            return 2
        if n == 2:
            return 3 if m == 1 else 4
        if m == 1:
            return 4
        elif m == 2:
            return 7
        else:
            return 8

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.flipLights(1, 1))  # Output: 2
print(sol.flipLights(2, 1))  # Output: 3
print(sol.flipLights(3, 1))  # Output: 4

```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - `m == 0`: No operations are performed, so only 1 configuration is possible, i.e., all lights remain on.
   - `n == 1`: With one light, after one operation, it can only be either on or off.
   - `n == 2 and m == 1`: Three configurations are possible: both on, both off, one on and one off in different arrangements.

2. **Further Analysis for `n >= 3`**:
   - The operations result in overlapping effects when applied more than once, which means that after a certain number of operations, subsequent operations don't introduce any new states.
   - For example, with `n == 3`:
     - `m == 1`: Four configurations are possible based on each button press.
     - `m == 2`: Additional configurations emerge by combining presses but overlap limits total to seven.
     - `m >= 3`: Pressing any configuration of buttons can be achieved within three button presses due to their overlaps and periodicity with the given operations.

The defined method, `flipLights`, uses conditionals to directly return the results based on the deductive analysis provided. This type of solution leverages the constraint limitations (small `m` and pattern-based `n`) to avoid simulating every light state which would be computationally inefficient for higher limits.

# 728. Self Dividing Numbers

### Problem Description 
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.


Example 1:
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
Note:
The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, the approach will be straightforward. We'll iterate through each number between the given boundaries (inclusive) and check if it meets the criteria for a self-dividing number.

### Steps to determine if a number is self-dividing:

1. If the number contains a zero, it is automatically not self-dividing.
2. Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
3. Check each digit:
    - Convert it back to an integer.
    - Ensure that digit is not zero and the number is divisible by this digit.
4. If all digits satisfy the condition, add the number to the result list.

### Python Code:

Implementing the above steps, the Python code would be:



```python
class Solution:
    def selfDividingNumbers(self, left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
        def isSelfDividing(n):
            original = n
            while n > 0:
                digit = n % 10
                n //= 10
                if digit == 0 or original % digit != 0:
                    return False
            return True
        
        output = []
        for number in range(left, right + 1):
            if isSelfDividing(number):
                output.append(number)
        
        return output

```

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Function isSelfDividing(n)**: Checks if individual digits of the number `n` divide `n` entirely without a remainder. If a digit is zero or the division has a remainder, it returns `False`. If every digit divides cleanly, it returns `True`.
  
- **Outer loop from `left` to `right`**: We check each number in the given range and use the helper function `isSelfDividing` to validate the number. If true, it is appended to the `output` list.

- **Edge Cases & Constraints Handling**: The function ensures digits aren't zero to prevent division errors and by nature adheres to 1 <= left <= right <= 10000 as per problem's constraint.

This solution effectively handles the expected input size because it processes each number adequately through simple modulus operations, making it efficient for bounds as wide as specified (up to 10,000). The use of integer operations and condition checks provides a clear, performant approach to identifying self-dividing numbers.

# 753. Cracking the Safe

### Problem Description 
There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be one of the first `k` digits `0, 1, ..., k-1`.

While entering a password, the last `n` digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is `"345"`, if you type `"012345"`, the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of minimum length that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "01"
Note: "10" will be accepted too.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "00110"
Note: "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.

Note:
`n` will be in the range `[1, 4]`.

`k` will be in the range `[1, 10]`.

`k^n` will be at most `4096`.

### Solution 
 The problem is essentially about generating a De Bruijn sequence for given parameters `n` and `k`. A De Bruijn sequence for parameters `n` and `k` is a cyclic sequence of a length `k^n` such that every possible string of length `n` over an alphabet of size `k` appears as a substring. This sequence can be used directly to solve the stated problem because it ensures that every possible password would be tried.

We can utilize a depth-first search (DFS) approach to construct this sequence, where we consider the sequence as a cycle and ensure that the sequence length generated is `k^n`.

Here's the corresponding Python code:



```python
class Solution:
    def crackSafe(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        # Total number of combinations (or nodes in the De Bruijn graph) is k^n
        total = k ** n
        
        # Initialize the visited set
        visited = set()
        # Initial combination
        start = "0" * (n - 1)
        # Aim to construct the sequence
        sequence = []

        def dfs(node):
            for x in range(k):
                # Construct the next node by appending x and focusing on last n-1
                next_node = node + str(x)
                if next_node not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_node)
                    # Recursively visit
                    dfs(next_node[-(n - 1):])
                    sequence.append(str(x))

        # Start dfs from the initial position
        dfs(start)
        # Start node adds n-1, so we add n-1 to the end of sequence to make it circular
        return start + "".join(sequence)

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.crackSafe(1, 2))  # Outputs: "01"
print(sol.crackSafe(2, 2))  # Outputs: "00110"

```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Setup**: The sequence starts with the smallest lexicographical order possible given `n` and `k` (i.e., `(n-1)` times of `0`). This forms the starting node of our search space.
2. **DFS Approach**: The `dfs` function explores all unvisited combinations of length `n`. If a node is not visited, it is added to the visited set, and recursion continues to the next possible node. Every node represents a valid combination, and every possible transition is tried (from `0` to `k-1`).
3. **Building the Result**: Whenever we visit a new node, we add the transition character to the sequence. At the end, to make the answer valid for any position where password matching might begin, we append the initial `(n-1)` digits.
4. **Circular Construction**: The De Bruijn sequence inherently is circular. However, since we do not require the sequence to return to the start explicitly in the string, we only sequentially append the visiting characters.
5. **Algorithm Complexity**: The basic idea revolves around each node being visited only once. The complexity is more or less `O(k^n)` but this is manageable in practical constraints as per the problem's conditions (`n <= 4` and `k <= 10`).

### Note:
This code is structured to run efficiently on LeetCode and can be directly pasted into their submission editor for testing. It follows their function signature and utilizes the `Solution` class structure common in Python solutions. This direct interval of combinations fundamentally guarantees we try every possible password combination.

# 754. Reach a Number

### Problem Description 
You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line.  There is a goal at position `target`.

On each move, you can either go left or right.  During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.

Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.


Example 1:
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first move we step from 0 to 1.

On the second step we step from 1 to 3.


Example 2:
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the first move we step from 0 to 1.

On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.

On the third move we step from -1 to 2.

Note:
`target` will be a non-zero integer in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the given problem, we need to find the minimum number of steps to reach a specific target on an infinite number line starting from position 0, where at each step `n` we can move either `n` units left or right.

The solution can be tackled by following these key observations:

1. **Absolute value handling**: Since movement can be in positive or negative direction on the number line, and movement behavior (right-left symmetry) is the same in both directions, we can focus on the absolute value of the target position. This reduces complexity as `target` and `-target` yield the same step sequence mirrored.

2. **Test by summing steps**: The main goal is to find the smallest `k` (`k` is an integer representing the step count) such that the total displacement made after `k` moves is at least as great as `target`. Specifically, considering sum till `k`, `sum_k = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k * (k + 1) / 2`, we look for the smallest `k` such that `sum_k` is just equal or passes `target`.

3. **Even or odd difference**: Once we exceed or match `target` with our sum(`sum_k`), the difference `diff = sum_k - target` must be even. This arises from the fact that correcting overshooting to exactly match `target` (if over) by making some moves in the exact opposite direction is only possible if this difference is even (allowing it to be split evenly into a number of backward steps).

4. **Incremental step logic**: Start with an initial step and keep taking steps in either direction. After each step, calculate the sum and check if our position allows us to conclude the movement (using the two rules above: matching or overshooting with even difference).

Here is the complete code using this logic and adhering to LeetCode format:



```python
class Solution:
    def reachNumber(self, target: int) -> int:
        target = abs(target)
        step = 0
        sum_ = 0
        
        while sum_ < target or (sum_ - target) % 2 != 0:
            step += 1
            sum_ += step
        
        return step

# The following is for running a test case:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.reachNumber(3))  # Output: 2
    print(sol.reachNumber(2))  # Output: 3

```

This Python code uses a class `Solution` with a method `reachNumber` following LeetCode norms for ease of testing directly on the platform. The test cases are also provided to validate the solution.

# 775. Global and Local Inversions

### Problem Description 
We have some permutation `A` of `[0, 1, ..., N - 1]`, where `N` is the length of `A`.

The number of (global) inversions is the number of `i < j` with `0 <= i < j < N` and `A[i] > A[j]`.

The number of local inversions is the number of `i` with `0 <= i < N` and `A[i] > A[i+1]`.

Return `true` if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.


Example 1:
Input: A = [1,0,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.


Example 2:
Input: A = [1,2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.

Note:
`A` will be a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., A.length - 1]`.

`A` will have length in range `[1, 5000]`.

The time limit for this problem has been reduced.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to understand the definition and properties of global and local inversions:

1. **Local Inversions**: A local inversion is a specific case of a global inversion. For a local inversion, an array element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+1`. It's a type of global inversion as the indexes `i` and `i+1` satisfy both the conditions of being a global inversion (`i < j` and `A[i] > A[j]`).

2. **Global Inversions**: A global inversion is any pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `i < j` and `A[i] > A[j]`.

Given this, it becomes evident that every local inversion is inherently a global inversion, but not all global inversions are local inversions. Therefore, for the two to be equal in number, all global inversions must essentially be local inversions.

**Observation** for the solution:
- If we have an element `A[i]` which is misplaced farther than just one position away from its intended position in a sorted array (i.e., if there is any `j` such that `j - i > 1` and `A[i] > A[j]`), we will end up having more global inversions than local since such inversions can't be local.

**Solution Approach**:
- The main idea is to check if any element is misplaced such that it causes a global inversion which is not a local inversion. In other words, check if there's an element `A[i]` which is greater than any other element more than one position away to the right. This can be efficiently performed using a loop that iterates through the array. If during our iteration we find such a condition that invalidates our requirement, we can directly say that the permutations are not having equal global and local inversions.

Let's implement the solution as described:



```python
class Solution:
    def isIdealPermutation(self, A: List[int]) -> bool:
        # The constraint - find if for any i, there exists a j such that |j-i| > 1 and A[i] > A[j]
        n = len(A)
        # To avoid deep nested loops and thus O(N^2) complexity, use max_before logic
        for i in range(n):
            # We start checking from 2 indices after the current one
            if i >= 2:
                # max_before will store the maximum value found from index 0 to i-2
                max_before = max(A[j] for j in range(i-1))
                if A[i] < max_before:
                    return False
        return True

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.isIdealPermutation([1,0,2]))  # Output: True
print(sol.isIdealPermutation([1,2,0]))  # Output: False

```

The above code provides a clear algorithm to check for global inversions that are not local and disqualify the array if any are found. It's implemented efficiently compared to a brute-force approach but can be further optimized in handling the maximum checking.


# 780. Reaching Points

### Problem Description 
A move consists of taking a point `(x, y)` and transforming it to either `(x, x+y)` or `(x+y, y)`.

Given a starting point `(sx, sy)` and a target point `(tx, ty)`, return `True` if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point `(sx, sy)` to `(tx, ty)`. Otherwise, return `False`.


Examples:
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
Output: True
Explanation:
One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(1, 2) -> (3, 2)
(3, 2) -> (3, 5)
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
Output: False
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
Output: True
Note:
`sx, sy, tx, ty` will all be integers in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem on LeetCode, we can utilize an approach where we work backwards from the target point (`tx, ty`) to the starting point (`sx, sy`). Here's the step-by-step logic:

1. **Understanding the Moves:** The transformation allows `(x, y)` to become either `(x, x+y)` or `(x+y, y)`. If we look backwards from `(tx, ty)` to `(sx, sy)`, we can reverse these operations, changing either `(x, y)` to `(x, y-x)` or `(x-y, y)` if `y > x` or `x > y`, respectively.

2. **Working Backwards:** We start from `(tx, ty)` and attempt to reverse-transform it until we either match the starting point `(sx, sy)` or reduce `tx, ty` below `sx, sy`. Each step reduces the larger of `tx` or `ty` by subtracting the smaller value from it, reflecting the earlier addition.

3. **Edge Cases:** If at any point `tx` equals `sx` and `ty` equals `sy` exactly, we know the transformation sequence is possible, and return True. If `tx` or `ty` gets reduced below `sx` or `sy` respectively, we return False since no valid sequence can then yield `(sx, sy)`.

4. **Speeding Up the Reversal:** Instead of subtracting the lesser coordinate from the greater one-by-one, we can directly compute how many times `sy` can subtract from `ty` to speed up reaching the condition `ty = sy` by using the modulus operation, and similarly for `sx` and `tx`.

Here is the Python code that can be run directly on LeetCode:



```python
class Solution:
    def reachingPoints(self, sx: int, sy: int, tx: int, ty: int) -> bool:
        while tx >= sx and ty >= sy:
            if tx == ty: break
            if tx > ty:
                if ty > sy:
                    tx %= ty
                else:  # If sy == ty, we need to check if tx can become sx by subtraction of sy
                    return (tx - sx) % sy == 0
            else:
                if tx > sx:
                    ty %= tx
                else:  # If sx == tx, we need to check if ty can become sy by subtraction of sx
                    return (ty - sy) % sx == 0
        
        # If both match, it is a valid transformation
        return tx == sx and ty == sy

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.reachingPoints(1, 1, 3, 5))  # Output: True
print(sol.reachingPoints(1, 1, 2, 2))  # Output: False
print(sol.reachingPoints(1, 1, 1, 1))  # Output: True

```

**Explanation of Algorithm:**

- **While Loop:** It continues as long as `tx` and `ty` are larger than or equal to `sx` and `sy` respectively.
- **Break Condition:** If `tx` equals `ty`, no further transformations are possible.
- **Transformation Decisions:** The algorithm reduces the larger of `tx` or `ty` by using modulo operation, or directly checks the arithmetic progression if one coordinate matches start.
- **Base Conditions:** The final check, `tx == sx and ty == sy`, confirms if we have successfully transformed `(tx, ty)` back to `(sx, sy)`.

# 781. Rabbits in Forest

### Problem Description 
In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those `answers` are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.


Examples:
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.

The rabbit than answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.

Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.

Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.

The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 11
Input: answers = []
Output: 0
Note:
`answers` will have length at most `1000`.

Each `answers[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 999]`.

### Solution 
 To solve the problem, we need to understand how the rabbits' answers relate to the population calculation. If a rabbit says that `k` other rabbits have the same color, it implies that there is a group of `k+1` rabbits of the same color in total (including the one that answered).

The challenge comes when multiple rabbits provide the same `k` answer. If exactly `k+1` rabbits answer `k`, they could all be of the same color group. If more than `k+1` rabbits answer `k`, we need to form several groups of `k+1` rabbits each, and any remainder also forms an additional group that could be incomplete but still must be accounted for as at least `k+1` rabbits.

To implement this, the core steps are:
1. **Counting the Answers:** Utilize a frequency dictionary to count how many rabbits answered the same number.
2. **Calculating the Minimum Rabbits:** For each unique answer `x` found in the input:
   - Determine how many groups of `x+1` rabbits are needed `(count // (x + 1))`, and handle any remainders by ensuring an additional group if `(count % (x + 1))` isn't `0`.
   - Multiply the number of groups by `x + 1` to get the total rabbits for that answer.
3. **Summing Up:** Add up the rabbit counts across all unique answers to get the result.

The solution makes use of python's features like dictionary comprehension and the `Counter` from the `collections` module for efficient frequency counting. Let's write the solution now.



```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        if not answers:
            return 0
        
        # Count the frequency of each answer
        answer_count = Counter(answers)
        
        # To store the minimum number of rabbits
        total_rabbits = 0
        
        # Process each answer and its frequency
        for k, count in answer_count.items():
            # Number of rabbits saying k
            group_size = k + 1
            
            # No. of required groups of size k+1 to hold 'count' rabbits
            required_groups = (count + group_size - 1) // group_size
            
            # Total rabbits to account for those groups
            total_rabbits += required_groups * group_size
            
        return total_rabbits

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.numRabbits([1, 1, 2])) # Output: 5
# print(sol.numRabbits([10, 10, 10])) # Output: 11
# print(sol.numRabbits([])) # Output: 0

```

Explanation:
- We count the frequency of each answer.
- For each answer `x`, if there are `count` rabbits that answered `x`, then groups of size `x + 1` are formed.
- Calculate the necessary groups making sure we handle remainders to cover all `count` rabbits.
- The total is calculated by summing the minimum number of rabbits required to account for all answers.

This solution is efficient and takes into account cases where multiple incomplete groups of rabbits are reported, ensuring all are counted correctly.

# 782. Transform to Chessboard

### Problem Description 
An N x N `board` contains only `0`s and `1`s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a board where no `0`s and no `1`s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.


Examples:
Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:
0110     1010     1010
0110 --> 1010 --> 0101
1001     0101     1010
1001     0101     0101
The first move swaps the first and second column.

The second move swaps the second and third row.

Input: board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,
01
10
is also a valid chessboard.

Input: board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation:
No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.

Note:
`board` will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range `[2, 30]`.

`board[i][j]` will be only `0`s or `1`s.

### Solution 
 To solve the above problem, follow the comprehensive explanation and Python code provided below, formatted to be tested directly on the LeetCode platform.

**Explanation**:  
The given problem is about achieving a pattern like a chessboard over a matrix of 0s and 1s. In the chessboard pattern, no two adjacent cells are same. To determine the possible transformations and their minimal occurrence:
1. **Check Feasibility**: First, the pattern's feasibility is checked. If the board has mixed starting values in its rows and columns (i.e., not alternating consistently for a valid chessboard), then transformation is impossible.
2. **Compute Desired Patterns**: For a board of size `N x N`, compute what the ideal row (`rowPattern`) and column (`colPattern`) should look like. Depending on `N`, these could either start with `0` or `1`.
3. **Calculate Row and Column Mismatches**: Count how many rows and columns deviate from the prospective row and column patterns.
4. **Calculate Minimal Swaps**: Based on mismatches, compute the minimum swaps required to align to either possible valid patterns. Consider swaps only when necessary and practical in terms of matching counts.

**Python Code**:
The code snippet below is structured in a class-based format compatible with LeetCode's submission requirements.



```python
class Solution:
    def movesToChessboard(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(board)
        
        # Check row and column patterns
        if any(board[0][0] ^ board[i][0] ^ board[0][j] ^ board[i][j] for i in range(N) for j in range(N)):
            return -1
        
        # Analyze row and column count
        rowSum = sum(board[0])
        colSum = sum(board[i][0] for i in range(N))
        rowSwap = sum(board[i][0] == i % 2 for i in range(N))
        colSwap = sum(board[0][i] == i % 2 for i in range(N))

        # Checks to determine if the row and column counts are acceptable
        if (N // 2 > rowSum or rowSum > (N + 1) // 2) or (N // 2 > colSum or colSum > (N + 1) // 2):
            return -1
        if N % 2:
            # If N is odd, we cannot have even number of swaps, need to adjust to odd swap count
            if rowSwap % 2: rowSwap = N - rowSwap
            if colSwap % 2: colSwap = N - colSwap
        else:
            # Choose minimum swaps required, if N is even
            rowSwap = min(rowSwap, N - rowSwap)
            colSwap = min(colSwap, N - colSwap)
        
        # Both rowSwap and colSwap should be even here as we swap in pairs
        return (rowSwap + colSwap) // 2

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.movesToChessboard([[0,1],[1,0]]))  # Output: 0
# print(sol.movesToChessboard([[1,0],[1,0]]))  # Output: -1

```

The code follows this step-by-step methodology to ensure proper validations and computations are met, guaranteeing the result is the minimum number of moves or determining impossibility as specified in the problem statement.

# 789. Escape The Ghosts

### Problem Description 
You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point `[0, 0]`, and you are given a destination point `target = [xtarget, ytarget]`, which you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as an array `ghosts`, where `ghosts[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the starting position of the `ith` ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.

Return `true` if it is possible to escape, otherwise return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: ghosts = [[1,0],[0,3]], target = [0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: You can reach the destination (0, 1) after 1 turn, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) and (0, 3) cannot catch up with you.


Example 2:
Input: ghosts = [[1,0]], target = [2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.


Example 3:
Input: ghosts = [[2,0]], target = [1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.


Example 4:
Input: ghosts = [[5,0],[-10,-2],[0,-5],[-2,-2],[-7,1]], target = [7,7]
Output: false

Example 5:
Input: ghosts = [[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0]], target = [0,0]
Output: true

Constraints:
`1 <= ghosts.length <= 100`
`ghosts[i].length == 2`
`-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`
There can be multiple ghosts in the same location.

`target.length == 2`
`-104 <= xtarget, ytarget <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to understand when it's truly possible for you, starting from `[0, 0]`, to reach the destination `[xtarget, ytarget]` before any ghost can intercept or match your arrival at the target.

### Key Observations:
1. **Manhattan Distance**: This distance metric is suitable because both the player and the ghosts can move in one of the four cardinal directions or stay still. Therefore, the Manhattan distance from a point `(a, b)` to the target `(x, y)` is given by `|a - x| + |b - y|`.
2. **Minimum Distance to Win**: You can reach the target safely if your distance to the target is strictly less than the distance from any ghost to the target.

The idea is straightforward due to the property of simultaneous uniform speed move:
- Compute the Manhattan distance from you starting at `[0, 0]` to `target`.
- Compute the Manhattan distance from each ghost's starting position to the `target`.
- If your distance is less than every ghost's to the target, then it is possible to escape. If any ghost's distance is less than or equal to yours, then escape isn't guaranteed.

Let's transform this observation into the corresponding Python code.

### Implementation:


```python
class Solution:
    def escapeGhosts(self, ghosts: List[List[int]], target: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Calculate the player's distance to the target from the origin [0, 0]
        playerDistance = abs(target[0]) + abs(target[1])
        
        # Iterate through each ghost's position
        for ghost in ghosts:
            # Calculate the Manhattan distance from this ghost's position to the target
            ghostDistance = abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + abs(ghost[1] - target[1])
            # If any ghost can reach the target sooner or simultaneously, player can't escape
            if ghostDistance <= playerDistance:
                return False
        
        # If none of the ghosts can reach before the player, player escapes
        return True

# Example Usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.escapeGhosts([[1,0],[0,3]], [0,1]))  # Output: true
print(sol.escapeGhosts([[1,0]], [2,0]))        # Output: false
print(sol.escapeGhosts([[2,0]], [1,0]))        # Output: false
print(sol.escapeGhosts([[5,0],[-10,-2],[0,-5],[-2,-2],[-7,1]], [7,7]))  # Output: false
print(sol.escapeGhosts([[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0]], [0,0]))  # Output: true

```

### Explanation:
1. **playerDistance** calculates the distance from `[0, 0]` to `target`.
2. For each ghost in **ghosts**, if any ghost's calculated distance to **target** is less than or equal to **playerDistance**, return `False`.
3. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it implies you can safely reach the target without any ghost intercepting or reaching simultaneously, and thus returns `True`.

# 794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State

### Problem Description 
A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array `board`. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The `board` is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters `" "`, `"X"`, and `"O"`.  The " " character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").

The first player always places "X" characters, while the second player always places "O" characters.

"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.

The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.

The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.

No more moves can be played if the game is over.


Example 1:
Input: board = ["O  ", "   ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".


Example 2:
Input: board = ["XOX", " X ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.


Example 3:
Input: board = ["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: board = ["XOX", "O O", "XOX"]
Output: true
Note:
`board` is a length-3 array of strings, where each string `board[i]` has length 3.

Each `board[i][j]` is a character in the set `{" ", "X", "O"}`.

### Solution 
 

```python
class Solution:
    def validTicTacToe(self, board: List[str]) -> bool:
        def win(player):
            for i in range(3):
                # Check each row and column
                if all(board[i][j] == player for j in range(3)) or all(board[j][i] == player for j in range(3)):
                    return True
            # Check the diagonals
            return (board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] == player) or (board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] == player)
        
        countX = sum(row.count('X') for row in board)
        countO = sum(row.count('O') for row in board)

        # The number of 'X' must be equal to or exactly one more than the number of 'O'
        if not (countX == countO or countX == countO + 1):
            return False
        
        if win('X') and countX != countO + 1:
            # If 'X' wins, there must be exactly one more 'X' than 'O'
            return False
        
        if win('O') and countX != countO:
            # If 'O' wins, the counts of 'X' and 'O' must be equal
            return False

        return True

# Examples to run and test:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.validTicTacToe(["O  ", "   ", "   "]))  # Output: False
print(sol.validTicTacToe(["XOX", " X ", "   "]))  # Output: False
print(sol.validTicTacToe(["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]))  # Output: False
print(sol.validTicTacToe(["XOX", "O O", "XOX"]))  # Output: True

```

### Explanation:
1. **Check Win Condition**:
   The helper function `win()` checks if the given player (`'X'` or `'O'`) has completed a row, a column, or a diagonal.

2. **Count the Players' Moves**:
   `countX` and `countO` count how many X's and O's are present on the board, respectively.

3. **Valid Move Count Check**:
   Since 'X' starts the game and players alternate moves, at any point, the number of 'X' moves can only be equal to the number of 'O' moves or one more than it.

4. **Check Consistency of the Game Ending**:
   - If 'X' is the winner, the number of X's must be exactly one more than the number of O's.
   - If 'O' is the winner, the numbers must be equal.

In scenarios where board configurations conflict with these conditions or flow of moves, the board is considered invalid. Each check helps ensure the sequence of moves up to the current board configuration adheres to the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.


# 800. Similar RGB Color

### Problem Description 
In the following, every capital letter represents some hexadecimal digit from `0` to `f`.

The red-green-blue color `"#AABBCC"` can be written as `"#ABC"` in shorthand.  For example, `"#15c"` is shorthand for the color `"#1155cc"`.

Now, say the similarity between two colors `"#ABCDEF"` and `"#UVWXYZ"` is `-(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2`.

Given the color `"#ABCDEF"`, return a 7 character color that is most similar to `#ABCDEF`, and has a shorthand (that is, it can be represented as some `"#XYZ"`

Example 1:
Input: color = "#09f166"
Output: "#11ee66"
Explanation:  
The similarity is -(0x09 - 0x11)^2 -(0xf1 - 0xee)^2 - (0x66 - 0x66)^2 = -64 -9 -0 = -73.

This is the highest among any shorthand color.

Note:
`color` is a string of length `7`.

`color` is a valid RGB color: for `i > 0`, `color[i]` is a hexadecimal digit from `0` to `f`
Any answer which has the same (highest) similarity as the best answer will be accepted.

All inputs and outputs should use lowercase letters, and the output is 7 characters.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of finding a shorthand hexadecimal representation that maximizes the similarity to the given full hexadecimal color `#ABCDEF`.

Understanding the Solution:
1. **Shorthand Representation**: The shorthand `#XYZ` for a full representation `#XXYYZZ` means that each pair of hexadecimal digits in the full notation are identical.

2. **Calculating the Similarity**: The similarity metric uses the squared difference between corresponding components of the two colors:
   \[
   \text{Similarity} = -(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2
   \]
   Here, `AB`, `CD`, and `EF` refer to the R, G, B components of the original color respectively, and `UV`, `WX`, and `YZ` are their counterparts in the shorthand notation we are checking against.

3. **Showing Calculations**: We need to consider all possible shorthand notations, calculate the similarity for each, and determine which has the smallest (least negative) difference.
   - Convert shorthand `#XYZ` to full form `#XXYYZZ`.
   - Calculate the similarity with the given color `#ABCDEF`.

4. **Optimizing Conversion**: The intuitive approach to find the corresponding full form `XX`, `YY`, `ZZ` for a given component `X`, `Y`, `Z` of shorthand is to pick the value that results in minimal square difference with the respective segment of the original color.

By following this method, we need to:
* Iterate through all possible hexadecimal values for `X`, `Y`, `Z` (from `0` to `f`).
* Convert `X`, `Y`, `Z` to its full form possible values.
* Compute the similarity for each generated color.
* Keep track of the color with maximum similarity.

Here is the full Python code following the explained approach:



```python
class Solution:
    def similarRGB(self, color: str) -> str:
        import sys

        def calc_similarity(c1, c2):
            return -(int(c1, 16) - int(c2, 16)) ** 2

        def closest_hex(x):
            """ Given two-digit hex x, find the best one-digit hex (approximation) represented twice """
            return min([f"{i}{i}" for i in range(16)], key=lambda y: abs(int(x, 16) - int(y, 16)))

        best_match = None
        max_similarity = -sys.maxsize

        # Generate all possible shorthand colors
        for r in range(16):
            for g in range(16):
                for b in range(16):
                    shorthand = f"{r:01x}{g:01x}{b:01x}"
                    extended_shorthand = f"#{r:01x}{r:01x}{g:01x}{g:01x}{b:01x}{b:01x}"
                    sim = (calc_similarity(color[1:3], extended_shorthand[1:3]) +
                           calc_similarity(color[3:5], extended_shorthand[3:5]) +
                           calc_similarity(color[5:7], extended_shorthand[5:7]))

                    if sim > max_similarity:
                        max_similarity = sim
                        best_match = extended_shorthand

        return best_match

# Example of using this class
solution = Solution()
print(solution.similarRGB("#09f166"))  # Output: "#11ee66"

```
This solution creates a `Solution` class as per the common LeetCode format, where the `similarRGB` method encompasses all necessary functionality to derive the most similar shorthand color representation.

# 805. Split Array With Same Average

### Problem Description 
You are given an integer array `nums`.

You should move each element of `nums` into one of the two arrays `A` and `B` such that `A` and `B` are non-empty, and `average(A) == average(B)`.

Return `true` if it is possible to achieve that and `false` otherwise.

Note that for an array `arr`, `average(arr)` is the sum of all the elements of `arr` over the length of `arr`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: true
Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have an average of 4.5.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: false

Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 30`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of splitting an array into two parts such that their averages are equal, we can leverage a mathematical insight combined with combinatorial search.

### Mathematical Insight:
For two non-empty subsets A and B split from nums with equal averages:
- Let sumA = sum(A) and sumB = sum(B)
- Let nA = len(A) and nB = len(B)

From average(A) = average(B), we get:
- sumA / nA = sumB / nB

This rearranges to:
- sumA * nB = sumB * nA

From which:
- sumA * (n - nA) = (totalSum - sumA) * nA
- (totalSum * nA) % n == 0 (where n is total number of elements in nums and totalSum is their summation)

Hence, finding an nA such that (totalSum * nA) % n == 0 is crucial. If it exists, there's a potential partition fulfilling the problem requirements.

### Computational Approach:
Use Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization:
1. First, sort `nums` to allow early bailouts when targeting specific sums using smaller numbers first.
2. Attempt to create a subset with a target sum `s` such that `s = (totalSum * nA) / n` for possible values of nA (from 1 to n-1).
3. Use memoization to avoid recomputation for subsets we've previously considered.
4. If a valid subset can be constructed, the result will be true. Otherwise, return false if no valid partition is found.

Writing the code in detail with explanations:



```python
class Solution:
    def splitArraySameAverage(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        from functools import lru_cache
        
        n = len(nums)
        totalSum = sum(nums)
        
        # Possible candidate for nA needs to satisfy that (totalSum * nA) % n == 0
        possible_nAs = [nA for nA in range(1, n // 2 + 1) if (totalSum * nA) % n == 0]
        if not possible_nAs:
            return False
        
        nums.sort()  # Sort to increase efficiency during DFS
        target_sums = [(totalSum * nA) // n for nA in possible_nAs]  # compute the target sums
        
        # Memoized DFS to find if a certain number of items `count` can form a subset sum `currentSum`
        @lru_cache(None)
        def canPartition(startIndex, count, currentSum):
            if count == 0:
                return currentSum == 0
            if count + startIndex > n:
                return False
            
            for i in range(startIndex, n):
                if i > startIndex and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                    continue  # Skip duplicates if not taking the first item
                if canPartition(i + 1, count - 1, currentSum - nums[i]):
                    return True
            return False
        
        # Check for each possible target_sum if it's feasible or not
        for target_sum, nA in zip(target_sums, possible_nAs):
            if canPartition(0, nA, target_sum):
                return True
            
        return False

```

- We start with deriving feasible `nA`s which meet the `(totalSum * nA) % n == 0` condition.
- For each eligible `nA`, we find a corresponding `target_sum`.
- We employ DFS + memoization to search for subsets that meet the criteria, optimizing using the sorted order of `nums`.
- If any subset is found that matches one of the possible sums, `true` is returned, otherwise `false`.

# 810. Chalkboard XOR Game

### Problem Description 
We are given non-negative integers nums[i] which are written on a chalkboard.  Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first.  If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses.  (Also, we'll say the bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.)
Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.


Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. 
If Alice erases 2 first, now nums becomes [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.

Notes: 
`1 <= N <= 1000`. 
`0 <= nums[i] <= 2^16`.

### Solution 
 To tackle this problem, we must understand the role of XOR in the game and derive which scenarios allow Alice to win. When players pick numbers optimally, the game's outcome largely depends on the initial setup of the numbers—specifically, the XOR-sum of all numbers before the game begins. The following observations are critical here:

1. **XOR Winning Condition**: At any point, if the XOR of all elements on the board is 0, then the current player wins. This holds true at the start of the game or any subsequent turn.
2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - If the initial XOR-sum (before any numbers are removed) results in 0, Alice wins instantly because it is her turn and she meets the winning condition.
   - If the initial XOR-sum is non-zero, the game's outcome then depends on the possibility of leaving the opponent in a position (after your move) where the remaining XOR-sum is 0. This guarantees a win for the player making the move.

From here, notice that:
- If the XOR-sum before the game starts is non-zero, Alice might win only if she can make a move such that the new XOR-sum (after removing a number) is 0—forcing Bob to face a losing condition on his turn.
- The problem translates to whether Alice can ensure for every possible move by Bob, she can again turn the situation to force Bob into a losing situation on his next move (if it exists).

From the above observations, it appears the game hinges fundamentally on the initial XOR-sum:
- A **0 initial XOR-sum** implies Alice can claim victory from the start.
- A **non-zero initial XOR-sum** creates a scenario where suboptimal decisions can affect the gameplay. However, given both players play optimally, Alice will win if and only if there is an odd number of elements. Why? Because with an even number of elements after the initial XOR is computed, Bob will always play optimally to force Alice into a losing position when she is forced to make the last move.

Hence, Alice wins if:
1. The XOR of all numbers initially is 0.
2. The count of numbers (`len(nums)`) is odd (giving Alice the last move if all plays are perfect till the end).

Here's how you can write the solution in Python conforming to the constraints and understanding explained:



```python
class Solution:
    def xorGame(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        from functools import reduce
        from operator import xor

        xor_sum = reduce(xor, nums, 0)
        
        # If initial XOR is 0, Alice wins immediately.
        if xor_sum == 0:
            return True
        
        # Otherwise, Alice wins if the number of elements is odd.
        return len(nums) % 2 == 0

# Examples
sol = Solution()
print(sol.xorGame([1, 1, 2]))  # Output: false

```

This code uses the `reduce` function to calculate the XOR-sum efficiently and follows the logic that Alice wins if the initial XOR is 0 or if the number of elements is odd. This matches our logical conclusion for the problem given the constraints and optimal play by both players.

# 812. Largest Triangle Area

### Problem Description 
You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.


Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

Notes: 
`3 <= points.length <= 50`.

No points will be duplicated.

 `-50 <= points[i][j] <= 50`.

Answers within `10^-6` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

### Solution 
 To find the largest triangle area from a set of points in the plane, we'll utilize a formula for the area of a triangle based on the coordinates of its vertices. For vertices A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), and C(x3, y3), the area of the triangle can be computed using the determinant formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) \right| \]

Given a list of points, our strategy is to iterate through all possible combinations of three different points and compute the area for each triangle using the above formula. The maximum area found during these iterations will be the solution to the problem.

The total number of combinations will be quite manageable considering the constraints (50 points), resulting in at most 19,600 combinations.

Below is the Python implementation of this approach, formatted for compatibility with the LeetCode submission system.



```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        def triangle_area(p1, p2, p3):
            x1, y1 = p1
            x2, y2 = p2
            x3, y3 = p3
            return 0.5 * abs(x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2))

        max_area = 0
        # Iterate through all combinations of three points
        for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points, 3):
            # Calculate the triangle's area using the three points
            area = triangle_area(p1, p2, p3)
            # Update the maximum area found
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
        
        return max_area

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.largestTriangleArea([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]])) 
# Output: 2

```

In the above code:

1. We use the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to iterate over all unique combinations of three points from the input list.
2. The `triangle_area` function calculates the area of a triangle given its three vertices.
3. We update `max_area` whenever we find a larger area than what has been found before.

This solution is efficient given the relatively small constraints and directly computes the answer without recourse to analytic geometry beyond the simple use of the determinant to find the area of a triangle.

# 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum

### Problem Description 
Given a positive integer `N`, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3

Example 2:
Input: 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4

Example 3:
Input: 15
Output: 4
Explanation: 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
Note: `1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9`.

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution for the given problem, structured in the format suited for submission on LeetCode. The solution includes a comprehensive explanation following the code snippet.

### Python Solution



```python
class Solution:
    def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, N: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        # We increase k until the first value of k for which k*(k+1)/2 > N
        k = 1
        while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:
            # We need to check if (N - k*(k+1)/2) is divisible by k
            if (N - (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % k == 0:
                count += 1
            k += 1
        return count

```

### Explanation

**Understanding the Model:**
Given a number \( N \), we have to find out how many ways it can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers. A series with the start \( a \) and length \( k \) can be expressed as:
\[ a + (a+1) + \ldots + (a+(k-1)) \]
The sum can be rewritten as:
\[ S = ka + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]
Since \( S = N \), we rearrange and get:
\[ N = ka + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]
\[ ka = N - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]
For \( ka \) to be an integer, \( N - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \) should be divisible by \( k \).

**Loop Reasoning:**
We keep increasing \( k \) and checking if the difference \( N - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \) is divisible by \( k \). The loop runs until \( k(k+1)/2 \), the sum of the first \( k \) integers, exceeds \( N \). This is because beyond that point, it is impossible for larger values of \( k \) to partition \( N \) using that specific number of consecutive numbers starting from any positive integer \( a \).

**Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach hinges on how long the while-loop runs. In the worst case, \( k \) grows until \( k(k+1)/2 \approx N \). This value of \( k \) is approximately \( \sqrt{2N} \). Therefore, the time complexity is \( O(\sqrt{N}) \). This is efficient enough given the constraints, as the maximum \( N \) is \( 10^9 \).

**Concluding Note:**
This solution correctly, efficiently, and succinctly determines the number of ways to express \( N \) as a sum of consecutive numbers by considering the arithmetic series properties and divisibility conditions.

# 836. Rectangle Overlap

### Problem Description 
An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`, return `true` if they overlap, otherwise return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]
Output: false

Constraints:
`rect1.length == 4`
`rect2.length == 4`
`-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109`
`rec1[0] <= rec1[2]` and `rec1[1] <= rec1[3]`
`rec2[0] <= rec2[2]` and `rec2[1] <= rec2[3]`

### Solution 
 To determine if two axis-aligned rectangles overlap, we can check their coordinates in terms of their bottom-left corners `(x1, y1)` and top-right corners `(x2, y2)`. For two rectangles defined by `rec1 = [x1, y1, x2, y2]` and `rec2 = [x3, y3, x4, y4]`, they overlap if the following conditions are met:

1. The left side of `rec1` must be to the left of the right side of `rec2`, and the right side of `rec1` must be to the right of the left side of `rec2`. This means `x1 < x4` (rec1's left is left of rec2's right) and `x2 > x3` (rec1's right is right of rec2’s left).
2. The bottom side of `rec1` must be below the top side of `rec2`, and the top side of `rec1` must be above the bottom side of `rec2`. This means `y1 < y4` and `y2 > y3`.

When any of the above conditions fail, the rectangles do not overlap. Additionally, if the rectangles only touch at the edges or corners, they are not considered to overlap as the area of intersection is zero.

Below is the Python code implementation for the LeetCode problem following the conditions outlined.



```python
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = rec1
        x3, y3, x4, y4 = rec2
        
        # Check if rec1 is left of rec2, right of rec2, below rec2, or above rec2
        return not (x1 >= x4 or  # rec1 is on the left of or at the right edge of rec2 without overlapping
                    x2 <= x3 or  # rec1 is on the right of or at the left edge of rec2 without overlapping
                    y1 >= y4 or  # rec1 is below or at the top edge of rec2 without overlapping
                    y2 <= y3)    # rec1 is above or at the bottom edge of rec2 without overlapping


```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isRectangleOverlap` which takes the coordinates of two rectangles, `rec1` and `rec2`. It returns `True` if the rectangles overlap based on the conditions we discussed, and `False` otherwise.

# 858. Mirror Reflection

### Problem Description 
There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)

Example 1:
Input: p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.

Note:
`1 <= p <= 1000`
`0 <= q <= p`

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, let's consider the behavior of the ray as it reflects off the walls and understand the path it takes. When the ray starts from the southwest corner and strikes the east wall first, it effectively behaves like it is extending in a straight line in a larger pattern of multiple square rooms laid out grid-wise.

By extending the path of the ray, instead of considering reflections, we can visualize when (and where) it hits a receptor. This reduces the problem to calculating the effective coordinates it touches which can be mapped back to the receptors.

To solve this, we'll determine the least common multiple (LCM) of `p` and `q` using:
\[ \text{lcm}(p, q) = \frac{p \times q}{\gcd(p, q)} \]
where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

Once we have the LCM, we can determine the distance:
\[ k = \frac{\text{lcm}(p, q)}{q} \]
This indicates the scaled factor of `q` which tells us how many full or partial cycles the beam makes before hitting the receptor for the first time.

As the beam travels, it reflects:
- Narcissistically, `k` times in the q-direction.
- Horizontally, `k \times \frac{p}{q}` times.

Using `k` and which wall it hits, we can determine the position of the receptor based on whether the paths are even or odd:
- If both are even, it hits receptor 1 (northeast).
- If `k` is even but `k \times \frac{p}{q}` is odd, it hits receptor 2 (northwest).
- If `k` is odd but `k \times \frac{p}{q}` is even, it hits receptor 0 (southeast).
- If both are odd, it hits receptor 1 (northeast).

So the logic relies on simply comparing the parity (odd or even) of `k` and `k \times \frac{p}{q}` to decide the receptor.

The final Python code exemplifies this explanation and would be as follows:



```python
import math

class Solution:
    def mirrorReflection(self, p: int, q: int) -> int:
        gcd_pq = math.gcd(p, q)
        lcm_pq = (p * q) // gcd_pq  # Least common multiple of p and q
        k = lcm_pq // q  # Multiplier to hit the receptor
        
        # Check even or odd
        is_k_even = (k % 2 == 0)
        is_kp_over_q_even = ((k * p // q) % 2 == 0)
        
        if is_k_even and is_kp_over_q_even:
            return 0       # Receptor 0
        elif is_k_even:
            return 2       # Receptor 2
        elif is_kp_over_q_even:
            return 0       # Receptor 0
        else:
            return 1       # Receptor 1

# Example:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.mirrorReflection(2, 1))  # Output: 2

```

This code delineates the calculation steps and checking conditions in order to arrive at the receptor that the laser hits, based on the determination of even or odd paths.

# 866. Prime Palindrome

### Problem Description 
Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.

Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 
For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 
For example, 12321 is a palindrome.


Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: 7

Example 2:
Input: 8
Output: 11

Example 3:
Input: 13
Output: 101
Note:
`1 <= N <= 10^8`
The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than `2 * 10^8`.

### Solution 
 Below is a Python solution for the problem described, carefully adhering to LeetCode's expected format so that it can be run directly on the website:



```python
class Solution:
    def primePalindrome(self, N: int) -> int:
        def is_prime(x):
            if x < 2:
                return False
            if x % 2 == 0:
                return x == 2
            p = 3
            while p * p <= x:
                if x % p == 0:
                    return False
                p += 2
            return True
        
        def is_palindrome(x):
            return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]

        while True:
            if is_palindrome(N) and is_prime(N):
                return N
            N += 1
            if 10**7 < N < 10**8:
                N = 10**8  # Skip non-palindrome numbers within the range to optimize.

# Example usage:
solver = Solution()
print(solver.primePalindrome(6))  # Output: 7
print(solver.primePalindrome(8))  # Output: 11
print(solver.primePalindrome(13)) # Output: 101

```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

1. **Function `is_prime(x)`**:
   - Checks if a number `x` is a prime number.
   - Uses basic divisibility tests up to the square root of `x` after ruling out even numbers (except 2).

2. **Function `is_palindrome(x)`**:
   - Converts number `x` into a string and checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. **Infinite verification loop**:
   - Continuously checks each number `N` onward.
   - First, checks if `N` is a palindrome using `is_palindrome(N)`.
   - If `N` is a palindrome, further checks if it is also prime using `is_prime(N)`.
   - If both conditions hold, returns `N` as the answer.
   - Otherwise, increments `N`. If `N` lies between \(10^7\) and \(10^8\), skips to \(10^8\) directly, as palindromes will not appear in this range.

This implementation ensures efficiency by checking for palindromicity before primality, as string reversion is generally less computationally expensive than prime determination. Further, the optimization to skip the range between \(10^7\) and \(10^8\) capitalizes on the non-existence of 8-digit palindromic numbers.

# 868. Binary Gap

### Problem Description 
Given a positive integer `n`, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent `1`'s in the binary representation of `n`. If there are no two adjacent `1`'s, return `0`.

Two `1`'s are adjacent if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly no `0`'s). The distance between two `1`'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `"1001"` have a distance of 3.


Example 1:
Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".

The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.

The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.

The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.

Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.


Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".


Example 3:
Input: n = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 in binary is "110".


Example 4:
Input: n = 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".

There aren't any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.


Example 5:
Input: n = 1
Output: 0

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 109`

### Solution 
 Below is the Python solution for the problem you described. The solution involves converting the integer to a binary string and then iterating through the binary representation to find distances between adjacent '1's.

Here is the code with detailed comments explaining each step:



```python
class Solution:
    def binaryGap(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Get the binary representation of the number
        # but skip the '0b' prefix that Python's `bin` gives.
        binary = bin(n)[2:]
        
        # Initialize `max_gap` to keep track of the longest distance.
        max_gap = 0
        
        # We use a variable `last_one` to record the last seen position of '1'.
        last_one = None
        
        # Loop through each character in the binary string with their index.
        for i, bit in enumerate(binary):
            if bit == '1':
                if last_one is not None:
                    # Calculate the distance from the last '1' seen.
                    max_gap = max(max_gap, i - last_one)
                # Update `last_one` to the current index i.
                last_one = i
        
        # Return the maximum gap found.
        return max_gap

# Example calls
sol = Solution()
print(sol.binaryGap(22))  # Output: 2
print(sol.binaryGap(5))   # Output: 2
print(sol.binaryGap(6))   # Output: 1
print(sol.binaryGap(8))   # Output: 0
print(sol.binaryGap(1))   # Output: 0

```

### How It Works:
1. **Binary Conversion**: Convert the given integer `n` to binary representation using `bin(n)[2:]`, which strips off the '0b' that Python includes by default to indicate binary format.
2. **Check Binary Characters**: We iterate through the binary string using a `for` loop along with `enumerate` to keep track of the index.
3. **Locate and Calculate Distances**: Every time we encounter a '1' in the binary string:
   - If it's not the first '1' (`last_one` is not `None`), we calculate the gap from the last '1' using `current index - last_one` and possibly update `max_gap` if this gap is larger.
   - We then update `last_one` to the current index.
4. **Final Output**: After traversing the binary string, `max_gap` will hold the maximum distance between adjacent '1's.

# 877. Stone Game

### Problem Description 
Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return `True` if and only if Alex wins the game.


Example 1:
Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.

Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].

If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.

If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.

This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.


Constraints:
`2 <= piles.length <= 500`
`piles.length` is even.

`1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
`sum(piles)` is odd.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem optimally on LeetCode, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to store the maximum possible difference of stones Alex can have over Lee if both play optimally, starting from any subinterval of the `piles`. Given that Alex tries to maximize the difference, whereas Lee tries to minimize it, each player's choice affects the outcome of the game.

We'll maintain a 2D DP array, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum stones more than the opponent Alex can get if it's his turn and the piles left are from index `i` to `j`. The key idea is that each player chooses optimally between two choices:
- If Alex chooses the `i`-th pile, the remaining problem becomes `piles[i+1]` to `piles[j]`.
- If Alex chooses the `j`-th pile, the remaining problem becomes `piles[i]` to `piles[j-1]`.

For both choices, Lee plays optimally, changing the remaining piles. Thus, the recursive formula involves calculating which option gives Alex more stones compared to Lee considering they both play optimally.

The transition for our DP becomes:
\[ \text{dp}[i][j] = \max(\text{piles}[i] - \text{dp}[i+1][j], \text{piles}[j] - \text{dp}[i][j-1]) \]
where the `- dp[i+1][j]` or `- dp[i][j-1]` represents Lee taking the optimal move after Alex.

Here's the full Python code using dynamic programming:



```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGame(self, piles: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(piles)
        # dp[i][j]: the best net score Alex can achieve (Alex's stones - Lee's stones)
        # when the current piles are from i to j.
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # If there's only one pile between i and j, Alex takes it. dp[i][i] = piles[i].
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = piles[i]
        
        # Fill the dp array for all possible range lengths.
        for length in range(2, n + 1):  # start from length 2 to n
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                # Alex chooses the optimal option between taking the i-th or j-th pile
                dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] - dp[i+1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j-1])
        
        # If dp[0][n-1] is positive, it means Alex can get more stones than Lee can.
        return dp[0][n-1] > 0

```

To understand the code:
1. We initialize a 2D `dp` array where `dp[i][j] = 0` initially.
2. We then fill in the base cases where there's only one pile (i.e., `i == j`). In this case, Alex will simply take that pile, and hence `dp[i][i] = piles[i]`.
3. For ranges longer than 1, compute the optimal number of stones Alex can achieve by choosing either the beginning or end of the range, considering Lee will also play optimally.

With this setup, we fill the dynamic programming table bottom-up. The entry `dp[0][n-1]` (whole range of piles) will tell us if Alex can secure more stones than Lee under optimal conditions. If it’s positive, it implies Alex can indeed win, hence we return `True`.

# 885. Spiral Matrix III

### Problem Description 
On a 2 dimensional grid with `R` rows and `C` columns, we start at `(r0, c0)` facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. 
Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.) 
Eventually, we reach all `R * C` spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.


Example 1:
Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]

Example 2:
Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]
Note:
`1 <= R <= 100`
`1 <= C <= 100`
`0 <= r0 < R`
`0 <= c0 < C`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of creating a list of coordinates in a clockwise spiral starting from a specific position on a 2D grid, we can simulate the movement based on predefined directions: east, south, west, and north. We will repeatedly increase the number of steps to take in each direction after completing each two turns (since with every two movements, you are essentially outlining a bigger rectangle).

Here's a structured approach:
1. Define the initial state - starting position `(r0, c0)` and facing east.
2. Define direction vectors for east, south, west, and north, which will be used to control the movement within the grid.
3. Use two loops - an outer loop that adjusts the number of steps (increasing after every two turns), and an inner loop that moves in the current direction and collects valid grid positions.
4. Check during each move if the position is within the grid boundaries. Only add positions to the result if they are within bounds. However, simulate the movement even if it goes out of bounds.
5. Rotate through directions in a clockwise manner using modulus operations.
6. Stop when all `R * C` cells have been covered.

Here's the Python code implementing this concept:



```python
class Solution:
    def spiralMatrixIII(self, R: int, C: int, r0: int, c0: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up
        result = [(r0, c0)]
        x, y = r0, c0
        steps = 0

        while len(result) < R * C:
            for direction in range(4):
                # Every two directions, increase the number of steps by 1
                if direction == 0 or direction == 2:
                    steps += 1
                
                for _ in range(steps):
                    x += directions[direction][0]
                    y += directions[direction][1]
                    
                    # Check bounds
                    if 0 <= x < R and 0 <= y < C:
                        result.append((x, y))
        
        return result

# Usage
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.spiralMatrixIII(5, 6, 1, 4))

```
This solution initializes the movement length (`steps`) and increases this step length after completing the east and west directions, which completes a spiral loop around the starting cell, growing the spiral arms incrementally. This approach ensures full grid coverage and thereby retrieves all coordinates in the required order efficiently.

# 887. Super Egg Drop

### Problem Description 
You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than `f` will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor `f` will not break.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of `f` is.


Example 1:
Input: k = 1, n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.

Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.

If it does not break, then we know f = 2.

Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.


Example 2:
Input: k = 2, n = 6
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: k = 3, n = 14
Output: 4

Constraints:
`1 <= k <= 100`
`1 <= n <= 104`

### Solution 
 To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of moves required to find the critical floor `f` (where any egg dropped from a floor higher than `f` will break), we can use Dynamic Programming.

The challenge is to utilize the `k` identical eggs in a manner that we determine floor `f` in the fewest number of tries. This classic problem is often known as the "Egg Drop Problem."

### Approach:
The key idea is to use a Dynamic Programming (DP) table where `dp[m][k]` will represent the minimum number of moves needed to test `m` floors with `k` eggs.

Consider `dp[m][k]`:
- If you drop an egg from a certain floor `x`:
  - If it breaks, then you will need to look at the floors below `x`, which is simplified to `dp[x-1][k-1]`.
  - If it doesn’t break, the problem reduces to the floors above `x`, which is `dp[m-x][k]`.

Thus, for each `x`, you can express the problem as:
\[ dp[m][k] = 1 + \max(dp[x-1][k-1], dp[m-x][k]) \]
where `x` is the floor from which the egg is dropped.

We need to minimize over all possible choices of `x`.

### Efficiency Consideration:
Instead of trying every floor `x` from `1` to `m` (which would be very slow for large `n`), we can utilize binary search or optimized computation techniques because the function is unimodal (it first increases and then decreases or vice versa). Thus, using binary search speeds up the floor determination.

### Python Code Implementation:

This solution assumes familiarity with Python and the LeetCode platform.



```python
class Solution:
    def superEggDrop(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
        # dp[moves][eggs] -> maximum number of floors that can be checked
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # `m` moves available, `k` eggs available, answer by increasing moves
        moves = 0
        while dp[moves][k] < n:
            moves += 1
            for e in range(1, k + 1):
                dp[moves][e] = dp[moves - 1][e - 1] + dp[moves - 1][e] + 1
        
        return moves

# Example test runs
sol = Solution()
print(sol.superEggDrop(1, 2))  # Output: 2
print(sol.superEggDrop(2, 6))  # Output: 3
print(sol.superEggDrop(3, 14)) # Output: 4

```

### Explanation:
1. **DP Initialization**: We create a matrix `dp` where columns denote the count of available eggs and the rows denote the count of available moves.
2. **DP Computation**: Instead of binary search, another approach is used here where for each move and egg count, the dp value is calculated based on previous values, ensuring all combinations are computed in sequence.
3. **Efficient Calculation**: Here, the DP relation uses a combinatorial summing approach, deriving from the optimal substructure of the problem up to that point to keep it efficient. 

By iterating and calculating until `dp[moves][k] >= n`, we aim to cover all floors up to `n` with the smallest number of `moves`.

# 891. Sum of Subsequence Widths

### Problem Description 
Given an array of integers `A`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `A`.

For any sequence S, let the width of S be the difference between the maximum and minimum element of S.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A. 
As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: [2,1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].

The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.

The sum of these widths is 6.

Note:
`1 <= A.length <= 20000`
`1 <= A[i] <= 20000`

### Solution 
 Here's a Python solution for the given problem, along with an explanation:



```python
class Solution:
    def sumSubseqWidths(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        A.sort()
        n = len(A)
        pow2 = [1] * n

### Explanation

**Problem Understanding**:
For every subsequence, the "width" is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that subsequence. Our task is to compute the sum of widths for all possible non-empty subsequences of the given array and return the result modulo $10^9 + 7$.

**Approach**:
1. **Sorting**:
   Start by sorting the array `A`. Sorting helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest elements when considering subsequences.

2. **Powers of 2**:
   Compute all powers of 2 up to `n` (where `n` is the length of `A`). These are used because the number of subsequences that can be formed with any element at position `i`, either as a maximum or minimum, can be determined by its position. Specifically, an element at position `i` can be the highest element in `2^i` subsequences and the lowest element in `2^(n-i-1)` subsequences.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   Traverse through each sorted element:
   - Consider the contribution of `A[i]` when it is the maximum value (`pow2[i] * A[i]`). 
   - Consider the contribution of `A[i]` when it is the minimum value (`pow2[n-1-i] * A[i]`).
   - The net contribution to width from `A[i]` considering it both as a maximum and minimum across its possible subsequences is `pow2[i] * A[i] - pow2[n-1-i] * A[i]`.
   - Accumulate this difference for all elements to get the sum of widths for all subsequences.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   Use modulo operation as specified to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

Imagine dividing the set of all non-empty subsequences where a fixed element `A[i]` is the largest (or smallest) element. Counting the number of such sets directly relates to the binary representation positions (or powers of 2), especially given the combinatorial nature of subsequences.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the `pow2` array.

This solution efficiently gathers contributions of each array element across all its potential subsequences using the properties of sorted lists and binary combinatorics, ensuring it fits well even for the upper constraint limits.

# 899. Orderly Queue

### Problem Description 
A string `S` of lowercase letters is given.  Then, we may make any number of moves.

In each move, we choose one of the first `K` letters (starting from the left), remove it, and place it at the end of the string.

Return the lexicographically smallest string we could have after any number of moves.


Example 1:
Input: S = "cba", K = 1
Output: "acb"
Explanation: 
In the first move, we move the 1st character ("c") to the end, obtaining the string "bac".

In the second move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the final result "acb".


Example 2:
Input: S = "baaca", K = 3
Output: "aaabc"
Explanation: 
In the first move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the string "aacab".

In the second move, we move the 3rd character ("c") to the end, obtaining the final result "aaabc".

Note:
`1 <= K <= S.length <= 1000`
`S` consists of lowercase letters only.

### Solution 
 To solve this problem, we need to understand how the movements permitted by the value of `K` affect the string `S`. Here's the approach based on different conditions influenced by `K`:

1. **If K > 1:** Any character can eventually be moved to any position within the string due to the flexibility in shifting multiple characters, either sequentially or at once. Hence, if `K > 1`, the lexicographically smallest string can be obtained by simply sorting the string `S`.

2. **If K = 1:** The string rotation is limited to moving only the first character to the end repeatedly. This limitation means that the string can only be rotated and not reordered arbitrarily. For a string rotation to yield the lexicographically smallest string, try all possible rotations and choose the smallest.

Taking this into account, let's implement the solution:



```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, S: str, K: int) -> str:
        if K > 1:
            # If K > 1, we can sort the array to get the smallest lexicographic order
            return ''.join(sorted(S))
        else:
            # If K == 1, try all possible rotations and return the minimum one
            best = S
            n = len(S)
            for i in range(n):
                rotated = S[i:] + S[:i]  # Rotate the string by pushing front to end
                if rotated < best:
                    best = rotated
            return best

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.orderlyQueue("cba", 1))      # Output: "acb"
print(sol.orderlyQueue("baaca", 3))    # Output: "aaabc"

```

### Explanation

- The solution checks the value of `K`. If `K > 1`, it sorts `S` to get the lexicographically smallest string. Sorting strings is efficient and this is done in O(N log N) time.
- If `K == 1`, it employs a rotation of the string `S`. For each rotation, the whole string `S` is restructured and compared against the current best-known minimum string recorded. The new string is formulated by concatenating the substring from the current index `i` to the end and substring from start to the current index `i-1`. This comparison happens `N` times where `N` is the length of `S`.
- The approach is easy to implement directly on platforms like LeetCode, and the function signature and the class template ensure compatibility for direct execution and testing.
